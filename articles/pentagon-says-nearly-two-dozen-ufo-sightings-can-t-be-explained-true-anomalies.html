      <h2>Pentagon says nearly two dozen UFO sightings can’t be explained: ‘True anomalies’</h2>

<p>More than 20 reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), commonly known as UFOs, have been identified as needing further analysis by the Pentagon, according to an annual report from the all-domain anomaly resolution office (AARO) released on Thursday. The report covers the period from May 1, 2023, to June 1, 2023, and includes 757 sightings reported to the Defense Department.</p>

<p>This report is significant as it highlights ongoing investigations into UAPs and the challenges faced by the AARO in analyzing these sightings. AARO director Jon Kosloski stated that the findings merit additional scrutiny, particularly regarding the 21 reports that he described as "true anomalies." The report also indicates that there is no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial life or advanced foreign technologies, which has implications for national security and aerospace research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Period of report: May 1, 2023, to June 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Total UAP reports received: 757.</li>
    <li>New sightings reported: 485.</li>
    <li>Reports warranting further investigation: 21.</li>
    <li>Resolved cases: 118, identified as balloons, birds, and drones.</li>
    <li>Unresolved cases pending analysis: 444.</li>
    <li>Reports of UAP in space: 49, originating from military or commercial pilots.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between May and June 2023, the AARO received a total of 757 reports of UAP sightings. Of these, 485 were new reports, while the remaining were from previous years. The AARO resolved 118 cases, identifying most as commonplace objects. The report also noted that 21 sightings were classified as true anomalies requiring further investigation.</p>

<p>AARO has emphasized the need for improved sensor data to resolve more cases effectively. The organization has committed to collaborating with military and technical partners to enhance data collection and reporting processes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>AARO director Jon Kosloski said, “AARO has discovered no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>He also stated, “AARO will provide immediate notification to Congress should AARO identify that any cases indicate or involve a breakthrough foreign adversarial aerospace capability.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon's UAP reports have gained attention in recent years, particularly as concerns about national security and potential foreign technology have emerged. The AARO is tasked with addressing these phenomena and has faced scrutiny regarding its ability to analyze the increasing number of reports. The report indicates that while some cases have been resolved, a significant number remain under investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>AARO will continue to analyze the unresolved cases and investigate the 21 reports deemed as true anomalies. The office is also expanding engagement with international partners to share information and best practices in addressing UAP sightings.</p>
