      <h2>Science advisor warns drone boom makes UFO sightings harder to verify</h2>

<p>Dr. Mona Nemer, Canada's chief science advisor, has stated that the rapid rise of consumer drones is complicating the verification of UFO sightings. In a memo, she expressed concerns that the increasing number of drones has made it challenging for authorities to distinguish between unidentified flying objects and hobbyist aircraft.</p>

<p>This issue is significant as it impacts how unidentified aerial phenomena are reported and analyzed. Nemer has urged the federal government to create a dedicated office to systematically collect and assess UFO reports, as the last such office was closed in 1995. She emphasized the need for clear resources and processes for handling sightings and suggested Canada compare its practices with those of allied countries.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dr. Mona Nemer raised concerns in a memo to cabinet staff.</li>
    <li>By 2021, Canada had approximately 53,000 drones, surpassing the 37,000 licensed aircraft.</li>
    <li>Transport Canada reported that the air traffic management system is not designed for the volume of drone traffic.</li>
    <li>Ottawa tightened drone regulations in 2019 under the Aeronautics Act.</li>
    <li>64% of drone users are unaware of existing regulations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1995, Canada closed its last UFO office at the National Research Council, limiting the systematic study of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
<p>In 2019, the federal government tightened drone regulations, including a ban on operators under 14 and requiring registration and safety training for drone operators.</p>
<p>By 2021, the number of drones in Canada surpassed the number of licensed aircraft, raising concerns among authorities about the implications for air traffic management.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Can we identify these devices at night?” Nemer asked in her memo. “Can we accurately assess their distance and speed based solely on their lights?”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The increase in drone use has coincided with a growing interest in UFO sightings. Past reports have indicated that the civilian drone sector is still in its early stages, and the lack of comprehensive data on users complicates regulatory efforts. Nemer's call for a dedicated UFO office reflects a need for improved oversight and analysis as drone technology continues to evolve.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities may consider establishing a standalone Drone Act to better regulate the sector and enhance safety measures, while Nemer's proposal for a UFO office awaits further discussion and potential implementation by the federal government.</p>
