      <h2>Watch Comet 3I ATLAS Approach Earth Live Online on Oct. 20</h2>

<p>On October 20, 2025, astronomers will livestream the closest approach of Comet 3I ATLAS to Earth, starting at 1:30 p.m. EDT (1730 GMT). The event will be available online for viewers worldwide.</p>

<p>This livestream is significant for astronomy enthusiasts and the general public, as it offers a rare opportunity to observe a comet making a close pass to Earth. The Virtual Telescope Project, led by astronomer Gianluca Masi, will host the event. Masi stated that the comet's visibility provides a unique chance to engage with the cosmos.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> October 20, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream Start Time:</strong> 1:30 p.m. EDT (1730 GMT)</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Distance:</strong> 3I ATLAS will approach within approximately 56 million miles (90 million kilometers) from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Best viewed in the western evening sky after sunset</li>
    <li><strong>Host:</strong> Virtual Telescope Project, led by Gianluca Masi</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS was discovered in January 2025. As it travels through the inner solar system, it has been steadily brightening. The comet will be positioned for optimal viewing on October 20, when it reaches its closest point to Earth.</p>
<p>During the livestream, viewers will be able to observe the comet in real time as it moves across the sky. Masi expressed excitement about the event and its potential to inspire interest in astronomy.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "So far, living in the Northern hemisphere, I could admire Comet 3I ATLAS only, but it is quickly joining the show and we are ready to amaze every astronomy lover with our live feed!" said Gianluca Masi, in an email to Space.com.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS is part of a series of celestial events that engage the public's interest in astronomy. Previous comets have also drawn attention during their close approaches, showcasing the dynamic nature of our solar system.</p>
<p>The visibility of comets is often limited, making events like this particularly special for skywatchers. The Virtual Telescope Project aims to enhance public engagement with astronomical phenomena through live broadcasts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the livestream on October 20, astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I ATLAS as it moves away from the sun. Further observations may provide additional insights into the comet's trajectory and characteristics.</p>
