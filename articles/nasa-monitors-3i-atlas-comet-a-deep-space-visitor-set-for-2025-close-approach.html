      <h2>Nasa monitors 3I Atlas comet: A deep space visitor set for 2025 close approach</h2>

<p>Scientists at Nasa have been closely tracking Comet 3I Atlas, which is expected to make a close approach to Earth in October 2025. The comet, believed to originate from beyond the solar system, has drawn significant interest from astronomers due to its unique trajectory and anticipated visibility.</p>

<p>This event is important because it presents a rare opportunity for scientific study and public observation. Nasa's deep space observation networks are preparing for extensive data collection to analyze the comet's composition and origin, which could provide insights into the early solar system and interstellar environments.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I Atlas is projected to approach Earth around October 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, will occur shortly after.</li>
    <li>The comet was detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>Current speed is confirmed at 57 km/s with a hyperbolic trajectory.</li>
    <li>Anticipated to become a naked-eye object for observers in late 2025.</li>
    <li>Imaging campaigns will involve the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>Global astronomical observatories are coordinating efforts for data collection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I Atlas was first detected by the ATLAS system, which provided initial data on its unusual path. Subsequent observations have refined its orbital parameters, confirming its projected close approach to Earth. Nasa has mobilized various observation assets to monitor the comet's development as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>As the comet warms up, it will begin to outgas, forming its characteristic coma and tail, which researchers are eager to study. Ongoing monitoring will ensure that resources are in place to capture this fleeting opportunity for scientific insight.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa officials have stated, "The trajectory of Comet 3I Atlas suggests it may be the third identified interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov." This statement emphasizes the potential significance of the comet in understanding interstellar materials.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of Comet 3I Atlas is part of Nasa's broader efforts to map and understand celestial objects with unusual orbital characteristics. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the composition of other stellar systems.</p>

<p>Comet 3I Atlas's hyperbolic trajectory indicates it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun, making it a prime candidate for offering unprecedented insights into the chemical makeup of other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor Comet 3I Atlas as it approaches the Sun. Educational initiatives are being planned to inform the public about safe observation methods, fostering a deeper appreciation for astronomy and space science. Updates on the comet's visibility and precise coordinates will be regularly released by astronomical organizations.</p>
