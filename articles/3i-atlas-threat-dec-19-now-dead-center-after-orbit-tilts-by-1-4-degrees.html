      <h2>3I/ATLAS Threat: Dec 19 Now 'Dead Center' After Orbit Tilts by 1.4 Degrees</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has reportedly altered its trajectory, now aimed at Earth, according to claims made public on November 7, 2025. The object, which has puzzled scientists with its unusual characteristics, is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometres.</p>

<p>This claim raises significant concerns within the astronomical community. If verified, it could change the status of 3I/ATLAS from a scientific curiosity to a global security threat. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) and NASA have initiated monitoring campaigns, but the recent allegations necessitate a critical reassessment of the potential risks posed by this object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: Approximately 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Reported orbit tilt: 1.4 degrees</li>
    <li>Claim made public by: 3I/ATLAS WHISTLEBLOWER account on November 7, 2025</li>
    <li>Current status of 3I/ATLAS: Unverified claims of course correction</li>
    <li>Monitoring agencies: International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), NASA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 7, 2025, a claim surfaced on the X platform, alleging that 3I/ATLAS had performed a significant course correction. This claim suggested that the object is now on a direct path toward Earth, with an orbit tilt of 1.4 degrees. The date of December 19, 2025, was highlighted as the potential closest approach, raising alarms among astronomers.</p>

<p>In response to the claim, NASA and the IAWN had previously begun monitoring 3I/ATLAS, but their efforts focused on observation rather than active deflection strategies. The object's unique characteristics have prompted ongoing discussions about its potential origins and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS poses no immediate threat to Earth,” NASA stated earlier in their monitoring campaign.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We must take the black swan event hypothesis seriously,” said Avi Loeb, emphasizing the need for vigilance regarding the object's unusual behaviour.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has displayed numerous anomalies that have perplexed scientists. Observations have noted a lack of typical cometary features such as a tail or significant gas emissions. This has led to speculation about the object's possible artificial propulsion, with some researchers suggesting it may not be a natural comet at all.</p>

<p>Previous reports have indicated that 3I/ATLAS exhibits non-gravitational acceleration, which contradicts standard comet behaviour. The ongoing monitoring efforts by NASA and the IAWN aim to better understand this interstellar visitor and assess any potential threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming weeks, as 3I/ATLAS re-emerges from solar conjunction, verification of the claimed orbital data will be crucial. The scientific community is awaiting independent confirmation from NASA and the IAWN regarding the object's trajectory and any implications for Earth.</p>
