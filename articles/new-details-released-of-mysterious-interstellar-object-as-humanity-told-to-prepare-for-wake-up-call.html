      <h2>New details released of mysterious 'interstellar object' as humanity told to 'prepare for wake-up call'</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that a mysterious interstellar object, designated 3I/ATLAS, has made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. NASA’s Perseverance rover captured images of the object as it came within 30 million kilometres of the Red Planet. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as researchers describe 3I/ATLAS as a "rare visitor" from outside our Solar System. The ESA emphasizes that interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS offer valuable insights into the formation of celestial bodies beyond our own planetary system. The ESA has utilized its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) to photograph the object, marking a notable advancement in our understanding of interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 30 million kilometres (18.6 million miles)</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: European Space Agency (ESA), NASA</li>
    <li>Image capturing instruments: Perseverance rover, ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO)</li>
    <li>Brightness of the object: 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than usual targets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars, prompting NASA's Perseverance rover to take photographs of the object. The ESA's ExoMars TGO also captured images of the comet. In the days following the approach, the ESA released details about the object’s characteristics and its significance in understanding interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Nick Thomas</strong>, principal investigator of the CaSSIS camera, stated, “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    The ESA remarked, “Every planet, moon, asteroid, comet and lifeform in our Solar System shares a common origin. But interstellar comets are true outsiders, carrying clues about the formation of worlds far beyond our own.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the latest interstellar object to capture the attention of scientists. Previous interstellar visitors have raised questions about the nature of such objects and their origins. The ESA's focus on these rare visitors highlights a growing interest in understanding the cosmos beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, which may reveal more about its composition and characteristics. Future observations may provide additional insights into this interstellar object.</p>
