      <h2>Space agency restricts data from comet 3I/ATLAS and raises global doubts among scientists</h2>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has restricted access to data from comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. This decision has raised concerns among scientists worldwide about the implications for ongoing research into the comet's unique properties.</p>

<p>The restrictions stem from budgetary limitations caused by a recent government shutdown in the United States, according to NASA. This has led to increased dependence on international collaborations with the European Space Agency (ESA) and other observatories, as researchers seek to analyze the comet's unusual chemical composition, which is rich in carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>Initial analyses revealed high levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.</li>
    <li>Nasa has restricted data access due to budget constraints.</li>
    <li>Collaboration with ESA and other observatories is crucial for research.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its extrasolar origin.</li>
    <li>The comet is the third interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was identified by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, initial analyses highlighted its unusual chemical composition. However, restrictions on data sharing were implemented by NASA due to budgetary pressures resulting from a government shutdown. This has prompted a call for greater international collaboration among scientific communities to further study the comet.</p>

<p>In November 2025, NASA's Europa Clipper probe collected additional data from 3I/ATLAS, which has since fueled discussions on planetary defense measures. The comet's unique trajectory and composition have made it a focal point for researchers, leading to intensified independent observations from various global observatories.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The restrictions on data from 3I/ATLAS have raised many questions within the scientific community,” said a NASA spokesperson. “We are actively seeking partnerships to facilitate further research.” 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The restrictions on comet 3I/ATLAS data come amid a broader trend of limited access to astronomical data due to budgetary constraints faced by space agencies. Previous incidents have highlighted the importance of international collaboration in the study of rare celestial objects, emphasizing the need for shared resources and knowledge.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its international partners plan to continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS, with a focus on its chemical composition and orbital dynamics. Future analyses are expected to deepen understanding of the comet and its implications for astrophysics.</p>
