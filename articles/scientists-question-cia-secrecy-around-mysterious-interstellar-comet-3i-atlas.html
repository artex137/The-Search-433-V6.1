      <h2>Scientists question CIA secrecy around mysterious interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On January 11, 2026, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has declined to confirm or deny the existence of classified documents related to the interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS, raising concerns among scientists about potential security implications. This response came in a letter to Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb, who has questioned the agency's stance.</p>

<p>The matter is significant as it highlights the differing perspectives between the CIA and NASA regarding 3I/ATLAS. While NASA has publicly classified the object as a natural comet, Loeb has suggested that the CIA's ambiguous response indicates a possible view of the comet as a "Black Swan" event, which could have unpredictable consequences. He theorizes that classified information may be kept secret to prevent public panic and to maintain credibility for future threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: January 11, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: New York, USA</li>
    <li>Subject: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>NASA classifies 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet</li>
    <li>Professor Avi Loeb leads research on the comet</li>
    <li>Upcoming closest approach to Jupiter: March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered and has been the subject of debate regarding its origin and behavior. NASA has classified it as a natural comet, while Professor Loeb and his colleagues have noted several unexplained anomalies, suggesting a possible artificial origin.</p>
<p>On January 11, 2026, the CIA responded to inquiries regarding classified documents about 3I/ATLAS, stating it could “neither confirm nor deny” their existence. This response has prompted further scrutiny and discussion among scientists.</p>
<p>In March 2026, 3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Jupiter, prompting ongoing analysis by Loeb's team.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s very interesting that they did not dismiss the existence of documents within the CIA on this matter,” said Professor Avi Loeb. “If you have a low probability event and you multiply by a large impact on society, it must be taken seriously.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific narrative surrounding 3I/ATLAS has been contentious since its discovery. While NASA has taken a clear position on the object, some researchers, including Loeb, argue that its unexplained behavior warrants further investigation into its origins.</p>
<p>The Breakthrough Listen project’s recent scan with the Green Bank Telescope found no artificial transmissions from the comet, but Loeb has criticized this result as inconclusive, suggesting that more data is needed to draw significant conclusions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb's team continues to analyze data collected from 3I/ATLAS, focusing on its upcoming closest approach to Jupiter in March 2026 for more clues about its nature and origins.</p>
