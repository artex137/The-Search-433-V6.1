      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS is shedding water like crazy, rewriting what scientists know about alien star systems</h2>

<p>Researchers have detected significant water release from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, according to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. The discovery indicates that the comet is emitting water at a rate of 0.04 tonnes per second, even while positioned three times farther from the Sun than Earth.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it may provide insights into the building blocks of life in extraterrestrial bodies and enhance understanding of how such bodies form outside the solar system. The study utilized observations from NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, which successfully detected traces of hydroxyl (OH) gas, a chemical fingerprint of water, in the comet's ultraviolet glow.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is releasing water at a rate of 0.04 tonnes per second.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted using NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</li>
    <li>The comet was detected at a distance three times farther from the Sun than Earth.</li>
    <li>Water detection was made possible through the comet's ultraviolet glow.</li>
    <li>This study is significant for understanding life-supporting components in extraterrestrial bodies.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet detected, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers have gathered data on comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, revealing its unique properties. The James Webb Space Telescope provided initial observations that indicated a high carbon dioxide to water ratio. Following this, NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory conducted further analysis, detecting hydroxyl gas as evidence of water release.</p>
<p>The study highlights that the comet's water release occurs under unexpected conditions, as it lies outside the typical region where solar system comets exhibit activity due to sunlight.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study, according to EurekAlert. “Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dennis Bodewits, professor of physics at Auburn, described insights like the presence of water in 3I/ATLAS as “notes” from other planetary systems that need to be understood to garner a clearer picture of the universe.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, the two other interstellar comets, 'Oumuamua and Borisov, exhibited distinct characteristics. 'Oumuamua was dry, while Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide. The differences among these comets highlight the variability in conditions across planetary systems.</p>
<p>The detection of water in 3I/ATLAS suggests that different environments can lead to diverse chemical compositions in celestial bodies, further expanding the understanding of planet formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue studying 3I/ATLAS to uncover more about its composition and the implications for understanding extraterrestrial life. Further observations will help clarify the mechanisms behind the comet's unexpected water release.</p>
