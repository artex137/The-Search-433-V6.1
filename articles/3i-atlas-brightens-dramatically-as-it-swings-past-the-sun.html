      <h2>3I/ATLAS Brightens Dramatically as it Swings Past the Sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known visitor from beyond our Solar System, has brightened significantly as it approaches its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, which it reached on October 29, 2023. Ground-based observations have been nearly impossible for the past month due to the comet's position almost directly behind the Sun.</p>

<p>This rapid brightening is significant for astronomers, as it suggests unusual activity on the comet's surface. Researchers have been using space-based observatories, particularly solar monitoring satellites, to track the comet's transformation. The findings may provide insights into the comet's composition and behavior as it passes through our Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet's brightness surged from about 2 astronomical units (AU) to 1.36 AU.</li>
    <li>Brightness increased at a rate proportional to the inverse of heliocentric distance to the 7.5 power.</li>
    <li>The comet appears distinctly bluer than sunlight, indicating gas emissions.</li>
    <li>Images showed a visible atmosphere, or coma, around the comet stretching about four arc-minutes.</li>
    <li>Estimated brightness at perihelion was around magnitude 9, visible through smaller telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between mid-September and late October 2023, astronomers observed Comet 3I/ATLAS closing in from approximately 2 AU to 1.36 AU from the Sun. During this period, the comet's brightness surged dramatically, prompting researchers to utilize solar monitoring satellites for observations. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2023, after which it began emerging from behind the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What we found was striking,” said Qicheng Zhang from Lowell Observatory. “This interstellar visitor is brightening at roughly twice the typical rate for comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The rapid brightening of 3I/ATLAS is unusual compared to typical comet behavior, where brightness generally increases gradually as ice turns to gas. Previous observations indicated that the comet's dust was reddish, making its current blue appearance particularly noteworthy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS emerges from behind the Sun, ground-based observers will have the opportunity to study it in detail during November and December 2023. Further investigations will aim to determine the cause of the comet's rapid brightening.</p>
