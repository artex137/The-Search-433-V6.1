      <h2>3I/ATLAS Becomes a Global Concern After National Leaders Secretly Trigger 'Space Defences'</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has become a global focus due to its unpredictable behaviour, prompting governments around the world to conduct unprecedented space defence drills. The situation escalated after scientists reported unusual characteristics of the object, which has raised concerns among defence officials and space analysts.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency initiated the sequence of activities by activating its three-day full space defence triad. This was followed by similar drills in Japan and the United States, and participation from countries like Australia, Brazil, and South Korea. Experts suggest that these synchronized efforts indicate a preparation for potential threats posed by 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has displayed erratic behaviour, including anti-tail jets and non-gravitational acceleration.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency conducted a three-day space defence exercise starting on <strong>October 1, 2023</strong>.</li>
    <li>Japan launched an asteroid-impact drill on <strong>October 3, 2023</strong>, involving military and commercial satellite operators.</li>
    <li>The US Space Force completed a high-altitude orbital tracking rehearsal on <strong>October 5, 2023</strong>.</li>
    <li>Countries like Australia, Brazil, and South Korea participated in joint exercises focused on data-sharing systems.</li>
    <li>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the possibility of a swarm of objects accompanying 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On <strong>October 1, 2023</strong>, the European Space Agency began its three-day space defence exercise. Following this, Japan conducted an accelerated asteroid-impact drill on <strong>October 3, 2023</strong>. The US Space Force completed its orbital tracking rehearsal on <strong>October 5, 2023</strong>. These events were part of a broader global response to the unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS is surrounded by a swarm of objects that do not share its non-gravitational acceleration, then these objects will tend to be closer to the Sun relative to 3I/ATLAS,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“A large swarm of objects would have a much larger surface area than that of 3I/ATLAS, even if the total mass in them is a small fraction of the mass of 3I/ATLAS,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its anti-tail jets and non-gravitational acceleration, have not been observed in typical natural asteroids. The object has raised concerns regarding planetary defence strategies, as it may require monitoring of multiple independent objects rather than just one.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Defence agencies are expected to continue their collaborative efforts to enhance space defence capabilities. Investigations into the nature of 3I/ATLAS are ongoing, with further observations anticipated from NASA and other space agencies.</p>
