      <h2>Newly discovered comets in the October sky</h2>

<p>This October, several newly discovered comets will be visible in the night sky, according to Uwe Pilz from the Vereinigung der Sternfreunde (VdS). The comets C/2025 R2 (SWAN), C/2025 A6 (Lemmon), and C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) will appear at different times and locations, provided weather conditions are favourable for stargazers.</p>

<p>The visibility of these comets is significant for both amateur and professional astronomers. Authorities are encouraging the public to observe these celestial events, while also providing information on the best viewing times and necessary equipment.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comets:</strong> C/2025 R2 (SWAN), C/2025 A6 (Lemmon), C/2025 K1 (ATLAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> C/2025 R2 (SWAN) from mid-October; C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) from mid-October; C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) currently visible in the far south of the northern hemisphere</li>
    <li><strong>Best viewing dates:</strong> C/2025 R2 (SWAN) from October 22 to 25; C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) brightest from late October to early November</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) reached closest point to the sun on October 8</li>
    <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Binoculars required for C/2025 R2 (SWAN); telescope needed for C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) and C/2025 K1 (ATLAS)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comets have been discovered and tracked throughout 2023:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>C/2025 A6 (Lemmon):</strong> Discovered in January by the Mount Lemmon Survey (MLS) in California.</li>
    <li><strong>C/2025 K1 (ATLAS):</strong> Detected in May by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li><strong>C/2025 R2 (SWAN):</strong> Discovered in September by an amateur astronomer using images from the SWAN instrument of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This region is quite high in the evening sky,” said Uwe Pilz, referring to the visibility of C/2025 R2 (SWAN). “The comet will appear in the middle of the month in the constellation of the Serpent Bearer.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) is easiest to find between October 21 and 23, when it will pass below the stars Rho and Epsilon in the constellation Bootes,” Pilz added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The three comets originate from our solar system and were all discovered this year. The Mount Lemmon Survey (MLS) focuses on identifying Near Earth Objects (NEO) and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHA). The discovery of these comets adds to the growing interest in celestial observation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Stargazers are encouraged to prepare for the visibility of these comets in the coming weeks. Observers should check local weather conditions and have the appropriate equipment ready for viewing.</p>
