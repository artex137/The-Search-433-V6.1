      <h2>Prediscovery Activity of New Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS: A Dynamically-Old Comet?</h2>

<p>New observations of the interstellar comet 3I/2025 N1 (ATLAS) have revealed significant activity prior to its discovery, according to a report by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The findings detail the comet's behavior during its inbound trajectory, reaching a heliocentric distance of 17 astronomical units (au) approximately one year before it was officially identified.</p>

<p>This research is important as it provides insights into the characteristics and behavior of 3I/ATLAS, which appears to be more consistent with old long-period and short-period comets in the Solar System than with the previously known interstellar comet 2I/Borisov. Researchers aim to deepen understanding of the comet's dust production and its implications for cometary studies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility.</li>
    <li>Active within a heliocentric distance of at least 6.5 au.</li>
    <li>Estimated dust production rate increased from 5 kg/s in early May 2025 to 30 kg/s by mid-July 2025.</li>
    <li>Initial dust outflow likely began around 9 au, coinciding with the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> ice.</li>
    <li>No significant outbursts were detected during prediscovery observations at distances of 13-17 au.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early May 2025, 3I/ATLAS was observed at a heliocentric distance of approximately 6 au, displaying a dust production rate of 5 kg/s. By mid-July 2025, this rate had increased to 30 kg/s at a distance of 4 au. The comet's brightening rate was noted to follow a steep curve, significantly greater than that of 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>Prior to these observations, a deep search was conducted in 2024 when the comet was at distances between 13-17 au. During this time, no significant brightening was detected, suggesting the comet did not experience strong outbursts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS shows characteristics more consistent with dynamically old long-period comets,” said Quanzhi Ye, a lead researcher on the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This research builds on previous findings regarding interstellar comets, notably 2I/Borisov, which has been the only other known interstellar comet. The behavior of 3I/ATLAS may provide valuable comparisons and insights into the nature of such celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze its dust production and activity to enhance understanding of its characteristics and origins. Further investigations will focus on the comet's behavior as it approaches the inner Solar System.</p>
