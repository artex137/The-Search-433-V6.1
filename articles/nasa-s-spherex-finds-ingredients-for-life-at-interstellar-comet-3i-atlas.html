      <h2>Nasa’s spherex finds ingredients for life at interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On February 7, 2026, NASA’s SPHEREx space telescope has detected a variety of organic molecules erupting from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing materials that have remained unchanged for billions of years. The observations were made last December as the comet displayed unusual behaviour, including a delayed brightening and unexpected methane production.</p>

<p>These findings are significant as they offer insights into the early Solar System and the potential building blocks of life. Researchers are studying the data to better understand the comet's composition and behaviour. The comet’s journey back into interstellar space continues to provide valuable information about the chemistry of distant star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA’s SPHEREx detected organic molecules from comet 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted in December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet passed close to the Sun in October 2025.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of the comet measures 2.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, 3I/ATLAS made a close pass by the Sun, which triggered the venting of subsurface ices. This event led to the release of compounds such as methanol, cyanide, methane, and carbon dioxide. In December 2025, observations by SPHEREx led to the discovery of a cocktail of organic molecules. Further data from the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes contributed to understanding the comet's unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are now seeing the usual range of early Solar System materials, including organic molecules, soot and rock dust,” said Carey Lisse, study lead at Johns Hopkins University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The more we learn about 3I/ATLAS, the more anomalous it looks,” noted Avi Loeb, an astronomer at Harvard.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever identified, following previous discoveries that have sparked interest in the composition and behaviour of such celestial bodies. The study of these objects helps scientists understand the materials present in other star systems and the origins of organic compounds in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from SPHEREx, Hubble, and Webb to gain deeper insights into 3I/ATLAS and its implications for understanding the chemistry of the early Solar System and beyond.</p>
