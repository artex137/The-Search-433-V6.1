      <h2>Bizarre reason Avi Loeb has invited Kim Kardashian to help research 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has invited reality television star Kim Kardashian to assist in his research on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, following her recent comments about the Moon landing. Loeb’s invitation comes after Kardashian claimed she believes in conspiracy theories regarding the Apollo 11 mission during the latest season of The Kardashians.</p>

<p>This unusual collaboration has sparked interest due to the scientific implications of 3I/ATLAS. NASA has confirmed that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through the solar system. Authorities are now discussing the need for transparency in scientific data sharing, particularly in light of a recent government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb has requested Kim Kardashian's help in obtaining high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The images were reportedly taken by NASA’s HiRISE camera on October 2 and 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>Loeb has not received a response from Professor Alfred McEwen at the University of Arizona regarding his request for data access.</li>
    <li>Nasa's acting administrator Sean Duffy confirmed that no aliens are associated with 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is known as the third interstellar comet discovered by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 3, 2023, Avi Loeb publicly stated his request for Kim Kardashian's assistance in obtaining images of the comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>Earlier, Kardashian expressed her belief in conspiracy theories regarding the Moon landing on the latest season of The Kardashians, which prompted a response from NASA.</p>
<p>NASA's Sean Duffy tweeted an invitation to Kardashian to attend a launch at Kennedy Space Center.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The dissemination of scientific information should not be held hostage to the politics of the government shutdown,” Loeb stated in an article on Medium.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Yes, @KimKardashian, we’ve been to the Moon before… 6 times!” Duffy tweeted, emphasizing the agency's achievements in space exploration.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest within the scientific community. Previous comments from Loeb have led to speculation about the possibility of extraterrestrial life, although NASA has consistently dismissed these claims. The conversation surrounding the comet has intensified due to Kardashian's celebrity status and her recent comments on social media.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb continues to seek access to the high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS to further his research. NASA's response to his request and the outcome of Kardashian's involvement remain to be seen.</p>
