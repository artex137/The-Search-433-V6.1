      <h2>Blue mystery in space: 3I/ATLAS, the interstellar comet that won’t stop surprising scientists</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered a peculiar interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, using NASA’s ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025. This comet is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and comet Borisov, and it has exhibited unusual colour changes that scientists are struggling to explain.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects. NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth as it approaches its closest point on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 267 million kilometres. Scientists are preparing for this event to gather more data on the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Only the third known interstellar object: previous objects are ‘Oumuamua and comet Borisov</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: about 267 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Comet has exhibited unusual colour changes, turning blue as it approaches the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by NASA on July 1, 2025. Initially, the comet appeared faint and icy. As it moved closer to the Sun, it transformed to a blue hue, reportedly appearing “bluer than the Sun itself.” After disappearing behind the Sun, it re-emerged displaying its blue glow once again.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is not just a speck of cosmic dust. 3IATLAS is an interstellar messenger, and every colour change is a clue,” a NASA researcher stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If we don’t observe a massive gas cloud around 3IATLAS in December, it could hint at some sort of propulsion system,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the ongoing exploration of interstellar objects, which began with ‘Oumuamua in 2017. The unusual characteristics of these objects continue to challenge existing scientific understanding and provoke discussions about their origins, with some researchers suggesting they could be artificial constructs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the December flyby approaches, telescopes worldwide are preparing to observe 3I/ATLAS in greater detail. Scientists aim to clarify the comet's surface features and tail, gathering data that may reveal whether it is a natural celestial body or something more complex.</p>
