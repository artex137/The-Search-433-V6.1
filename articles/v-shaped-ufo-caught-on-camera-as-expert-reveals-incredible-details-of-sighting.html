      <h2>V-shaped UFO sighting reported in Los Angeles</h2>
<p>On August 28, a pair of residents in Los Angeles reported seeing a black, V-shaped craft covered in lights while on their balcony. The witnesses observed the craft for approximately 25 minutes before losing sight of it around 11:38 p.m. local time (2:38 a.m. ET), according to a report logged with the National UFO Reporting Centre.</p>

<p>This sighting is part of a growing number of reports this year that describe similar V-shaped or triangular crafts with multiple lights flying over the United States. Officials have noted the increase in such sightings, prompting further investigation into the phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: August 28</li>
    <li>Location: Los Angeles, California</li>
    <li>Time of sighting: Approximately 11:13 p.m. to 11:38 p.m. local time</li>
    <li>Duration of observation: About 25 minutes</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Two residents</li>
    <li>Reporting agency: National UFO Reporting Centre (NUFORC)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the evening of August 28, two residents spotted the V-shaped craft from their balcony. They reported the sighting to NUFORC, detailing their observations of the craft, which was illuminated by nine white lights along its hull. The witnesses lost sight of the object at 11:38 p.m. local time.</p>

<p>UFO researcher Mark Christopher Lee has analyzed the footage and images submitted by the witnesses. He suggested that the object may not be extraterrestrial but rather an unmanned drone associated with government technology testing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I'm convinced that a lot of famous UFO incidents are basically highly advanced terrestrial technology that is 30 to 40 years ahead of what we think they have,” said Mark Christopher Lee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NUFORC added a note stating, “Ultralight?” which refers to a type of small, lightweight aircraft.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting aligns with a trend of increased reports of V-shaped UFOs across the United States this year. Experts suggest that many sightings may be related to advanced technology being tested by the military or government agencies, rather than extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<p>Mark Christopher Lee noted that Los Angeles could be a hub for such technological developments, with nearby facilities like Vandenberg Space Force Base, Edwards Air Force Base, and Area 51 possibly contributing to the sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the reported sightings are ongoing, as authorities continue to analyze the images and videos submitted by witnesses. Further information regarding the nature of the craft and any potential links to government operations is expected to emerge in the coming weeks.</p>
