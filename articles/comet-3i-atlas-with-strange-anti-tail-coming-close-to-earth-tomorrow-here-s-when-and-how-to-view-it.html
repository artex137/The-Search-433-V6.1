      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS with strange anti-tail coming close to Earth tomorrow</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will pass closest to Earth on Friday, 19 December 2025, at a distance of 268.9 million kilometres. This flyby presents a rare opportunity for viewing before the comet exits the solar system permanently.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in its rarity, as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor. NASA has been monitoring the comet, which was discovered during summer surveys by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, known for detecting potentially hazardous asteroids. As of 14 December 2025, the comet was 270.5 million kilometres away from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass within 268.9 million kilometres of Earth.</li>
    <li>Closest approach is on Friday, 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>As of 14 December 2025, the comet was 270.5 million kilometres away.</li>
    <li>Viewing is best before dawn on Friday.</li>
    <li>Observers should look east to northeast beneath Regulus in constellation Leo.</li>
    <li>The comet will later pass near Jupiter in March 2026, at a distance of 53 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>NASA has reported the comet's size is estimated between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Weather conditions will affect visibility; livestream viewing will be available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS during summer surveys. Scientists confirmed its interstellar origin shortly thereafter. Images taken since July have shown an unusual feature of the comet, referred to as an anti tail, which remains visible through November observations. As of now, NASA continues to monitor the comet using space telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This may be the best chance to see the comet,” said Chelsea Gohd from NASA, providing tips for December skywatching.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets, such as 3I/ATLAS, provide unique insights into materials originating beyond the Milky Way. Researchers have not yet identified its home system, making current observations particularly valuable.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its close approach to Earth, 3I/ATLAS will continue its trajectory out of the solar system, exiting interstellar space in the mid-2030s. Scientists will continue to study its behavior and characteristics until then.</p>
