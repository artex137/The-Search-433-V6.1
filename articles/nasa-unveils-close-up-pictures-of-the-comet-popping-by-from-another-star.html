      <h2>NASA unveils close-up pictures of the comet popping by from another star</h2>

<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — NASA has unveiled close-up pictures of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which is currently making a brief tour of the solar system. The comet, discovered over the summer, passed Mars last month at a distance of 18 million miles (29 million kilometers) without causing any harm.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed object to visit the solar system from another star. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are actively observing the comet as it approaches Earth, providing a rare opportunity for astronomers to study an object from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: About 190 million miles (307 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) in mid-December</li>
    <li>Discovered: Summer 2025</li>
    <li>NASA spacecraft involvement: Three spacecraft near Mars, including the Webb Space Telescope</li>
    <li>ESA involvement: Two satellites and Juice spacecraft</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in the summer of 2025. It made its closest approach to Mars in October, passing at a distance of 18 million miles (29 million kilometers). NASA and ESA spacecraft have been observing the comet since then, with the Webb Space Telescope and ground telescopes now focusing on it. The comet will reach its closest point to Earth in mid-December before heading back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it’s a fascinating and rare opportunity,” said NASA’s acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That means that 3I/Atlas is not just a window into another solar system, it’s a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,” said NASA scientist Tom Statler.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/Atlas is a comet,” said NASA’s associate administrator, Amit Kshatriya, addressing rumors of it being an alien ship.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is one of only three known interstellar objects to enter the solar system, providing unique insights into the formation of celestial bodies. The observations made during its visit may help scientists understand more about the conditions in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches its closest point to Earth. Observations from various spacecraft and ground telescopes will provide data until the comet exits the solar system, with significant findings expected after the Juice spacecraft transmits data in February 2026.</p>
