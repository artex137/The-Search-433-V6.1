      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS emits radio signals and activates NASA’s planetary defense plan in 2025</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense plan following the detection of unusual radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS on December 19, 2025. The comet, which was first identified by the ATLAS system in Rio Urban, Chile, on July 1, 2025, is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it allows scientists to further investigate the comet's characteristics and trajectory. According to NASA, the unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS has prompted a coordinated response from the international scientific community to ensure thorough monitoring and analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of detection: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed: Exceeding 100,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>First identified by: ATLAS system, operated by Universidade of Havaí</li>
    <li>Radio signals recorded on: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Frequency of signals: 1.6 GHz</li>
    <li>Comet's nucleus size: Between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS system detected comet 3I/ATLAS in Chile. The comet's trajectory and unusual radio signals prompted NASA to mobilize its planetary defense team. Radio signals were recorded by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa on October 24, 2025. The comet is expected to reach its closest proximity to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote> 
    “The approach of an interstellar object is a rare event, making it an object of study of great relevance to the scientific community,” said a representative from NASA. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is classified as a remnant ejected from another star system millions of years ago. Its detection follows established protocols for monitoring uncertain objects with anomalous trajectories. Previous interstellar comets, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided insights into the formation of debris in other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and analyze its chemical composition using large telescopes. This ongoing research aims to enhance understanding of the comet's nature and its implications for planetary formation in the solar system.</p>
