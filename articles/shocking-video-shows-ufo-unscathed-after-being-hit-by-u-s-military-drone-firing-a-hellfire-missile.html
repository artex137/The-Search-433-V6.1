      <h2>Shocking Video Shows UFO Unscathed After Being Hit by U.S. Military Drone Firing a Hellfire Missile</h2>

<p>A video has emerged showing an unidentified flying object (UFO) surviving a strike from a U.S. military drone's hellfire missile off the coast of Yemen. The footage, presented by Republican Representative Eric Burlison at a congressional hearing, depicts the UFO traveling at a high speed despite being hit by the missile, which weighs approximately 45 kilograms. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the incident.</p>

<p>This revelation has sparked renewed interest in UFO sightings and government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Witnesses have testified to seeing UFOs, and some claim they faced pressure from government officials to remain silent. The ongoing hearings aim to shed light on these phenomena and the U.S. government's alleged cover-up of related information.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Incident Date:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li><strong>Missile Type:</strong> Hellfire missile (100 pounds / 45 kilograms)</li>
    <li><strong>Witnesses:</strong> Eyewitness testimony from multiple individuals</li>
    <li><strong>Congressional Hearing:</strong> Conducted by Rep. Eric Burlison</li>
    <li><strong>Department of Defense Office:</strong> All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) established in 2022</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, Congress has held hearings on UAPs, aiming to address years of speculation regarding UFO sightings. The AARO was created in 2022 to investigate these claims and standardize data collection. In March 2024, an AARO report concluded there was no evidence to support claims that the government has concealed alien technology.</p>
<p>During a congressional hearing, Rep. Eric Burlison showcased a video of a UFO that reportedly survived a missile strike. Eyewitnesses shared their experiences, describing the UFOs as both spherical and triangular in shape. Some claimed they were pressured to remain silent about their encounters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We know that there are objects or phenomena observed in our airspace and also possibly in our oceans. The American people have legitimate questions, and I believe it’s critical that Congress should help address them.”</blockquote>
<p>- Rep. Robert Garcia</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a larger pattern of UAP sightings and government investigations. In 2023, then-Senator Marco Rubio revealed that UFOs "routinely" fly over U.S. airspace. Recently declassified documents have detailed UFO sightings at an Ohio military base, including incidents where the Air Force halted operations to investigate.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress will continue to investigate UAP sightings and the government's response to them. Further hearings are expected, and pressure for transparency regarding unidentified phenomena is likely to increase.</p>
