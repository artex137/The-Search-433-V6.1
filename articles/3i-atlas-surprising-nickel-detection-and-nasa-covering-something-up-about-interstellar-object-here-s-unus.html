      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Object Detected with Unusual Nickel Emissions</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected an interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS, which is exhibiting unexpected chemical emissions and behavior, according to reports from NASA and international observatories. The object, roughly the size of Manhattan, was first observed in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing scientific understanding of cometary behavior and may provide insights into materials from beyond our solar system. NASA continues to monitor the object through the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) but has not made any public announcements since its detection.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately the size of Manhattan</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Distance to Earth:</strong> Approximately 268 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Period:</strong> November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Key Observatories:</strong> Very Large Telescope (VLT), James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. Following its detection, the object began exhibiting unusual signs, including unexpected acceleration and an anti-tail pointing toward the Sun. NASA activated planetary defense systems to monitor its behavior.</p>

<p>In the following months, scientists using the Very Large Telescope in Chile detected nickel vapor in the object’s gas cloud, a finding that defies known cometary behavior. This observation has led to ongoing research and analysis of the object’s chemical composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>“3I/ATLAS may represent a rare and unpredictable cosmic phenomenon with unknown implications,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. “It could even be of artificial origin, suggesting it might be an alien probe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Its unique characteristics, such as the detection of nickel without iron and a hyperbolic orbit, challenge current models of cometary physics and may provide insights into the formation of planetary systems across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>International teams from multiple countries will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS using advanced telescopes. The data collected during its closest approach could help scientists determine the nature of its unusual chemical emissions and enhance understanding of the interstellar medium.</p>
