      <h2>Avi Loeb Rips NASA on 3I/ATLAS: 'Unacceptable' Images Hide Mothership Seeding Jupiter</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has criticized NASA's images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as 'not acceptable,' claiming they obscure evidence of artificial design. Loeb made these remarks as the comet approaches Jupiter, fueling a debate about its true nature and implications for extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<p>This controversy has sparked significant interest within the scientific community and among the public. Authorities are now facing calls for more transparency regarding the comet's characteristics and potential origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on 2 July 2025 via the ATLAS survey.</li>
    <li>Perihelion achieved on 29 October 2025, 2.2 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA's HiRISE camera photographed the comet on 2 October 2025, at a distance of 190 million miles.</li>
    <li>Loeb proposes the comet serves as a mothership for technological probes aimed at Jupiter.</li>
    <li>Comet is expected to intersect Jupiter's Hill radius on 16 March 2026, at 53.5 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Earth approach anticipated on 19 December 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 2 July 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS during the ATLAS survey, marking it as the third interstellar object following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. The comet reached perihelion on 29 October 2025, inviting further observation.</p>
<p>NASA captured images of 3I/ATLAS using the HiRISE camera on 2 October 2025. These images revealed an unusual leading glow and sparked speculation regarding the comet's composition and behavior.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb introduced his mothership theory, suggesting that the comet could be a vessel designed to deploy mini-probes to Jupiter, igniting debates over its implications for our understanding of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Let us suppose, hypothetically, that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a mothership that was designed to seed Jupiter with technological devices."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb added, "There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," criticizing NASA's portrayal of the comet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Penn State astronomer Jason Wright countered, "The anomalies stem from natural outgassing, not spacecraft traits," highlighting the divide within the scientific community.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed since August 2024, with its peculiar characteristics challenging traditional cometary norms. The ongoing debate about its origins reflects broader discussions within the scientific community regarding the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>
<p>NASA has maintained that 3I/ATLAS is a standard comet, presenting images on 20 November 2025 that depict it as a 'fuzzy white ball' with MAVEN data confirming its icy makeup.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As anticipation builds for the comet's approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, calls for unfiltered data and further analysis of 3I/ATLAS continue. The scientific community is urged to prioritize data-driven conclusions over administrative narratives.</p>
