      <h2>3I/ATLAS's Coma Is Largely Carbon Dioxide</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in early July, has drawn significant attention from astronomers as it approaches its perihelion in October. Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed that the comet's coma is primarily composed of carbon dioxide (CO2), according to a recent study led by Martin Cordiner of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>

<p>This finding is important because it challenges previous understandings of comet compositions. The unusual CO2 dominance, with an 8 to 1 ratio of carbon dioxide to water, is the highest ever recorded in a comet's coma. Researchers are continuing to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it nears the Sun, seeking to gather more data before it becomes less visible.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>The JWST observed the comet's coma on August 6, 2023, at a distance of 3.32 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The CO2 to water ratio in the coma is 8 to 1, the highest recorded for any comet.</li>
    <li>The study was led by Martin Cordiner, affiliated with NASA and the Catholic University of America.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach its perihelion in early October 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in early July 2023. On August 6, the JWST conducted observations of the comet, noting its unique composition. As the comet approaches its perihelion in October, astronomers have intensified their observations to gather as much data as possible before it becomes less visible.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The ratio of carbon dioxide to water is six standard deviations above the typical value seen in comets,” said Martin Cordiner, highlighting the significance of the findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor, with 3I/ATLAS following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. While ‘Oumuamua did not show a detectable coma, 2I/Borisov had a higher carbon monoxide to water ratio, providing a comparative context for these new findings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and its perihelion in October. Additional observations may occur before the comet becomes too faint to detect, with hopes of capturing further data on its composition and behavior.</p>
