      <h2>Scientist: Space object 3I/ATLAS showed signs of artificial origin</h2>

<p>The 3I/ATLAS space object, currently located in the Solar System, has shown signs that suggest it may have an artificial origin, according to Harvard University scientist Avi Loeb. Loeb shared his conclusion on his blog, stating that the object's continued stability and integrity after passing near the Sun is unusual for natural space objects.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it challenges existing understandings of interstellar objects and raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities and scientists are now focused on monitoring the object closely, with the hope of gathering more data during its next approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>3I/ATLAS is currently located in the Solar System.</li>
<li>Avi Loeb from Harvard University has identified signs of artificial origin.</li>
<li>The object has shown no signs of decay after its close pass to the Sun.</li>
<li>Images from November 11 indicate the object remains an active formation.</li>
<li>The spacecraft "Juno" is expected to potentially detect 3I/ATLAS's radio signals on March 16, 2026.</li>
<li>Earlier reports suggested 3I/ATLAS may have sent its first radio wave signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 11, images of the 3I/ATLAS object were published on the Astronomer's Telegram portal, showing it intact after its close approach to the Sun. Following this, Avi Loeb analyzed the data and concluded that the object’s characteristics suggest an artificial origin.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, on March 16, 2026, the comet is expected to be near Jupiter, providing an opportunity for the "Juno" spacecraft to capture low-frequency radio signals from 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "This is the only way to explain the amazing fact that 3I/ATLAS has not yet collapsed and has remained a single active body."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb expressed hope that the upcoming approach to Jupiter would allow "Juno" to catch its radio signal at low frequencies, which could clarify the object’s mysterious properties.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing interest in interstellar objects and their potential origins. Previous incidents involving unidentified space phenomena have prompted scientists to consider the possibility of artificial constructs beyond Earth.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS has already generated speculation among experts, with some suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft, marking a significant point of discussion within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in 2026. The expected radio signals from the object may provide further insights into its nature and origins.</p>
