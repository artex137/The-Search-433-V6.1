      <h2>Avi Loeb Claims Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Was a Potential Spacecraft We Let Slip</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has claimed that the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> passed Earth on <strong>19 December 2025</strong>, potentially carrying biological seeds of alien life. Loeb argues that humanity missed a crucial opportunity to investigate what he describes as a potential 'interstellar gardener' or alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>This assertion raises significant questions about humanity's preparedness for extraterrestrial encounters. Authorities have not disclosed any plans to investigate further, but the scientific community is divided over the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a mere comet versus a more complex entity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of close encounter:</strong> 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Claimant:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li><strong>Potential implications:</strong> Biological seeds of alien life</li>
    <li><strong>Scientific consensus:</strong> Majority classify it as a comet</li>
    <li><strong>Loeb's theory:</strong> Possible vessel for life, linked to panspermia</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On <strong>19 December 2025</strong>, 3I/ATLAS made a close pass by Earth. Standard satellites had detected the object months prior, but no mission was mobilised to intercept it. Following the encounter, Loeb has publicly criticized the scientific community for not taking action.</p>

<p>Loeb has suggested that the object's tail contained essential ingredients for life, including water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane. He noted that methane detection occurred after the object passed the sun, which he argues raises questions about biological activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The cost of missing out on discovering alien life is far higher than the price of a probe,” said Loeb, emphasizing the need for investment in space exploration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“For all we know, we might all be Martians,” he remarked, suggesting that life on Earth could have originated from celestial exchanges.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time a celestial object has sparked debate among scientists regarding the potential for life beyond Earth. Previous incidents have seen similar disagreements about the classification of unidentified objects, highlighting ongoing discussions in the scientific community about the nature of extraterrestrial life and the importance of space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, no official investigations into 3I/ATLAS have been announced. The scientific community continues to discuss the implications of Loeb's claims, while funding for space exploration remains a contentious issue. Further research may be needed to determine the true nature of such interstellar visitors.</p>
