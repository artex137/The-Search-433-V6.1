      <h2>Newly visible, city-size 'green comet' will soon be ejected into interstellar space — just like 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A newly discovered green comet, C/2024 E1 (Wierzchoś), is brightening as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach expected on February 17, 2024. The comet, about the size of a small city, is predicted to be ejected from the solar system into interstellar space, similar to the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>Experts have noted that Comet Wierzchoś has been observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which detected significant amounts of carbon dioxide in its coma. This comet's trajectory suggests it is on a one-time journey through the inner solar system, with a gravitational slingshot likely sending it into deep space after its close encounter with Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> C/2024 E1 (Wierzchoś)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> March 2024 by Kacper Wierzchoś at Mount Lemmon Observatory, Arizona</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> February 17, 2024, at approximately 94 million miles (151 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Estimated nucleus diameter of 8.5 miles (13.7 kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> January 20, 2024, at about 52 million miles (84 million km) from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Observable with a telescope or binoculars; best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Wierzchoś was discovered in March 2024. It reached its perihelion on January 20, 2024, and is set for its closest approach to Earth on February 17, 2024. The comet has recently become much brighter and has developed a long tail of gas and dust.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet is likely on a one-time journey through the inner solar system,” said an unnamed expert. “Its trajectory suggests it will be ejected into interstellar space.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Wierzchoś is classified as a hyperbolic comet, indicating it does not orbit the Sun repeatedly. This is similar to the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, which passed through the inner solar system in 2023 and is now on its way back out, following a similar path into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach, Comet Wierzchoś will take several decades or even centuries to officially leave the solar system, drifting through the Milky Way for millions or billions of years.</p>
