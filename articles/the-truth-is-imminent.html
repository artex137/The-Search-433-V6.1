      <h2>The Truth Is Imminent</h2>

<p>Prime Video’s documentary <strong>The Age of Disclosure</strong> has premiered, shedding light on UFO mythology and alleged government cover-ups, with significant contributions from military and government personnel. The film, directed by Dan Farah, runs for 110 minutes and features notable figures such as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former U.S. Department of Defense staffer Luis Elizondo.</p>

<p>This documentary is significant as it aims to recontextualize UFO myths and raise awareness about the ongoing efforts to disclose information regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). It has sparked renewed interest in Congress, where public hearings on UAPs have taken place, and proposed legislation has been introduced to ensure the military reveals what it knows.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Film title:</strong> The Age of Disclosure</li>
  <li><strong>Director:</strong> Dan Farah</li>
  <li><strong>Starring:</strong> Marco Rubio, Kirsten Gillibrand, James Clapper</li>
  <li><strong>Running time:</strong> 110 minutes</li>
  <li><strong>Key claim:</strong> Existence of a secret program studying alien technology</li>
  <li><strong>Legislation:</strong> The UAP Disclosure Act proposed in Congress</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The documentary explores UFO mythology, particularly focusing on the 1947 Roswell incident, which many believe involved a crashed alien craft. It features interviews with military and intelligence personnel who claim to have encountered alien technology.</p>

<p>Elizondo, who helped establish the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), states that he uncovered an even older program dedicated to studying alien crafts. He resigned from AATIP to advocate for transparency regarding UAPs, leading to increased media attention and congressional hearings over the past three years.</p>

<p>The U.S. Congress has held public hearings where Elizondo and others have testified about UAPs, urging the military to disclose information. Senator Chuck Schumer has been a prominent supporter of these efforts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The evidence seems to have been sufficiently compelling to prompt members of Congress into action to uncover any objective evidence that may exist regarding the subject,” said Elizondo in the film.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rubio confirmed, “The USAF does not have air superiority over North America,” which raises concerns about potential foreign powers accessing advanced technology.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The film highlights a long-standing culture of UFO mythology in America, which has gained prominence over the last 80 years. It emphasizes the need for transparency regarding UAPs, particularly as public interest and congressional pressure mount.</p>

<p>Previous incidents, such as the Roswell crash, have fueled speculation and belief in UFOs, leading to a complex narrative about government secrecy and the potential existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The proposed UAP Disclosure Act continues to be discussed in Congress, with the goal of requiring military and legacy programs to release information about UAPs. Investigations into these phenomena are ongoing, and public interest remains high as the quest for transparency continues.</p>
