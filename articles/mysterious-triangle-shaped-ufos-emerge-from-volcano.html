      <h2>Mysterious triangle-shaped ‘UFOs’ emerge from volcano</h2>

<p>Two mysterious triangle-shaped “UFOs” have been spotted flying out of the Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico during the early hours of Friday morning, November 21. The objects were filmed exiting the crater just minutes apart, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The sightings have drawn attention to Popocatepetl, one of Mexico’s most active volcanoes. Authorities have not yet commented on the videos or the origin of the flying objects. The phenomenon has sparked interest among UFO enthusiasts, with some suggesting the volcano may act as a portal for intergalactic travel.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Two triangle-shaped objects filmed exiting Popocatepetl.</li>
    <li>Videos captured around five minutes apart.</li>
    <li>Filming occurred in the early hours of November 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>Popocatepetl is located in the states of Puebla and Morelos.</li>
    <li>Volcano’s altitude is 5,426 metres (17,802 feet).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 21, 2023, monitoring cameras at Popocatepetl captured two videos of triangular objects flying out of the volcano. The first object was seen ascending from the volcano's right flank, while the second was filmed shortly after from the opposite flank.</p>

<p>The clips were recorded within a short time frame, leading to speculation and discussion among viewers regarding the nature of the objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No man-made object could enter the crater as temperatures reach around 1,000 degrees Celsius,” claimed UFO expert Jaime Maussan, who has previously suggested that Popocatepetl acts as an inter-dimensional portal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It’s just a moving camera reflection,” asserted one local, while another commented, “I’ve always believed that the volcano is used as a secret hideout by aliens or real-life supervillains.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Popocatepetl has a history of activity and has been the subject of various UFO claims over the years. Jaime Maussan, a noted UFO expert, has previously linked the volcano to theories of intergalactic travel, citing magnetic storms and X-points that could connect to the Sun’s atmosphere.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for investigation or further analysis of the videos, and it remains unclear if any official inquiries will be made regarding the sightings.
