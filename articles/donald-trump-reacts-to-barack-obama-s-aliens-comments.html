      <h2>Donald Trump Reacts to Barack Obama’s ‘Aliens’ Comments</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has stated that former President Barack Obama made a "big mistake" by disclosing "classified information" regarding aliens during a recent interview. Trump made these comments on Thursday while speaking to Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy.</p>

<p>This exchange is significant as it highlights the ongoing debate about UFOs and government transparency. Trump’s comments come in the wake of increased public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena and the government's handling of such information. Authorities have not disclosed any new investigations or actions following these remarks.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump made remarks on October 26, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comments were made during an interview with Fox News.</li>
    <li>Obama had discussed aliens in an interview with journalist Brian Tyler Cohen.</li>
    <li>A 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that 65% of Americans believe intelligent life may exist on other planets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Barack Obama stated that statistically, there is a good chance intelligent life exists in the universe, but he saw no evidence of extraterrestrial contact during his presidency. He clarified that he was trying to be humorous and downplayed his comments on social media.</p>

<p>In response, Trump stated that Obama "gave classified information" and expressed uncertainty about the existence of aliens. Trump has a history of discussing UFOs, often expressing skepticism while acknowledging the possibility of their existence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “He gave classified information. He’s not supposed to be doing that. I don’t know if they’re real or not…I can tell you he gave classified information. He made a big mistake.” 
    — President Donald Trump
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” 
    — Former President Barack Obama
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discussion is part of a broader narrative regarding government transparency on UFO sightings. Trump has addressed the subject multiple times, often indicating he has received briefings on the matter. In 2019, he expressed doubt about UFOs and stated he had a brief meeting regarding Navy reports on the topic.</p>

<p>Obama's comments have drawn skepticism online, particularly as he attempted to clarify his statements. The conversation reflects the ongoing public interest in UFOs and the government's role in disclosing related information.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no disclosed plans for further investigations or actions from either the Trump or Obama camps regarding the comments made. Public interest in UFOs may prompt future discussions or inquiries into government transparency on the subject.</p>
