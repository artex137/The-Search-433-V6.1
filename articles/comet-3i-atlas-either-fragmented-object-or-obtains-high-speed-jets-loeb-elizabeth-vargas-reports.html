      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Loses Mass During Closest Approach to Earth</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has reported that comet 3I/ATLAS has lost an extreme amount of mass as it makes its closest approach to Earth. This event has drawn attention from the scientific community, particularly due to its implications for understanding comet behavior.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the composition and stability of comets. Scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to better understand its characteristics and the potential effects of its high-speed jets, which may indicate fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently making its closest approach to Earth.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a prominent astrophysicist at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>The comet has lost a substantial amount of mass during this approach.</li>
    <li>Details regarding the specific amount of mass lost have not been disclosed.</li>
    <li>The event has prompted discussions in the scientific community about comet behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed approaching Earth, with significant observations made recently regarding its mass loss. As it nears, scientists have noted unusual jets that may suggest the object is fragmenting.</p>

<p>Harvard's Avi Loeb has engaged with media to explain the implications of these observations, noting that they provide critical insights into the nature of comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The loss of mass in 3I/ATLAS is extraordinary and merits further investigation."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation follows a growing interest in the behavior of comets, particularly as they approach the Sun. Previous studies have indicated that some comets can exhibit similar mass loss, although the extent observed in 3I/ATLAS is notable.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves closer to Earth, with further analyses expected to clarify the reasons behind its mass loss and jet activity.</p>
