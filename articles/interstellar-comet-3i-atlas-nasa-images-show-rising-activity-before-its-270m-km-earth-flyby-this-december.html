      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: NASA Images Show Rising Activity Before Its 270m km Earth Flyby This December</h2>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency have reported that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has increased its activity as it approaches Earth, with its closest flyby set for 19 December at a distance of 270 million kilometres. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This increase in activity is significant as it allows scientists to study the comet's behaviour after its recent pass near the Sun, which has triggered stronger emissions of gas and dust. NASA has shared new images from the Hubble Space Telescope, which provide a clearer view of the comet's bright nucleus and expanding coma, indicating that it is responding to solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently 270 million kilometres away.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of the comet measures between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres wide.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured new images showing an active surface.</li>
    <li>ESA's Juice spacecraft provided additional images from 66 million kilometres away.</li>
    <li>The recommended viewing time for observers is before dawn, beneath the star Regulus in the constellation Leo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, astronomers confirmed 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar visitor. NASA outlined its size, speed, and unusual composition in a detailed report. The comet has spent months travelling through the inner Solar System, with its activity increasing following its closest approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>Recent images from both the Hubble and Juice spacecraft have shown enhanced emissions from the comet, suggesting it is undergoing rapid activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comets brighten as they heat up, and the jet-like features in the new image point to an active surface responding to solar radiation,” NASA explained in a statement.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is considered one of the largest interstellar objects detected, with a history believed to span nearly 10 billion years. This December marks its only close approach to Earth, providing a unique opportunity for scientists to study the comet's response to extreme heating as it travels through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to observe 3I/ATLAS again in the coming weeks. Observations by both professional and amateur astronomers will continue to gather data, refining predictions for the comet's future trajectory as it moves toward a close encounter with Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
