      <h2>NASA Detects Unusual Chemical Activity Around Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA scientists and international researchers have detected unusual chemical activity around the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently located nearly three times the distance between Earth and the Sun. Recent observations have revealed that the comet is producing cyanide and nickel without any detectable iron in its gas plume. This phenomenon has not been observed in natural comets before.</p>

<p>This discovery has raised questions about the comet’s origins and whether they could be natural or technological in nature. The findings challenge existing models of cometary composition and highlight the comet’s growing list of anomalies, prompting further investigation by NASA and other agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently located approximately 3 AU (astronomical units) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is losing about 20 grams of cyanide and 5 grams of nickel per second.</li>
    <li>The close encounter with Mars is scheduled for October 3, 2025, at a distance of 29 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Observations are being conducted using the Very Large Telescope and data from NASA's ongoing missions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA scientists have been monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS since its discovery. Recent spectroscopic data has indicated the production of unusual chemical elements, including significant amounts of nickel and cyanide, while lacking iron. This observation marks a departure from typical cometary behavior.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to approach Mars on October 3, 2025, providing an opportunity for close-up observations. The HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will capture detailed images during this event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The peculiar behavior of 3I/ATLAS should not be dismissed. Its precise trajectory and chemical anomalies leave room for speculation that it might not be a purely natural object,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies using NASA’s space telescopes have shown that 3I/ATLAS is unusually rich in carbon dioxide and poor in water, contrasting with typical comets in our solar system. The comet's lack of a traditional tail has led researchers to suggest it may be more massive than initially estimated, possibly making it one of the largest interstellar objects ever observed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA scientists are preparing for the close encounter with Mars in 2025, which will provide crucial data to determine the nature of the comet’s unusual properties. Researchers are also calling for coordinated radio telescope observations to investigate potential artificial signals from the comet.</p>
