      <h2>Interstellar object flying through our solar system spotted above Mars</h2>

<p>A strange interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has been observed above Mars, with images captured by NASA's Perseverance rover. The object has drawn attention due to its unusual appearance, sparking theories about its nature since the images were released recently.</p>

<p>This observation matters as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Scientists are currently analyzing the images and awaiting further data from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) to provide more clarity on the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
<li>Location: Above Mars, captured by Perseverance rover</li>
<li>Date of observation: Recent (exact date not disclosed)</li>
<li>Notable size: Estimated over <strong>28 miles</strong> in diameter</li>
<li>Agencies involved: NASA, ESA</li>
<li>Current status: Images being analyzed; additional data pending</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed by NASA's Perseverance rover, which has sent back images showing the object in a peculiar elongated shape and glowing green hue.</p>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has analyzed the images and suggested that the cylinder-like appearance could be an illusion caused by the camera's technique of stacking multiple images over a period of time.</p>

<p>Dr. Horace Drew, a former researcher with Australia’s CSIRO, has contested the comet theory, suggesting the object may not be a comet at all and proposing an alternative explanation for its glow.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist: "The apparent cylinder from the rover's 'Navcam' was likely caused by the camera stacking hundreds of images of 3I/ATLAS over a period of about 10 minutes, making it look more like a log than a ball."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Horace Drew: "It is not a 'comet'. The eerie green glow could be caused by nickel coating, which humans also use to shield and protect Earth-made spacecraft."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb: "Clear images and a scan of the supposed comet's composition were the key findings that could definitively tell scientists what 3I/ATLAS is."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the interstellar object Oumuamua, which flew past Earth in 2017 and generated considerable interest regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life. The current debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflects ongoing interest in unusual celestial phenomena.</p>

<p>The ESA has confirmed its use of two spacecraft to observe 3I/ATLAS, but it has indicated that data analysis could take days or weeks.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA are expected to release additional images and data from their ongoing analysis, which may provide more definitive information about the composition and nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
