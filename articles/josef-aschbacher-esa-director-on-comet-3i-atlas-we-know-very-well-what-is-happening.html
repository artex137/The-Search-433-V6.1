      <h2>Josef Aschbacher, ESA Director, on comet 3I/ATLAS: “We know very well what is happening”</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS network in Chile, is now heading toward Earth and will make its closest approach on December 19, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third recorded celestial object from another solar system. The European Space Agency (ESA) is actively tracking the comet and has dismissed speculation regarding its origin, affirming that it is not of alien nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2023, in Chile by the ATLAS network.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023, at approximately 153.5 million miles (274 million km).</li>
    <li>Close approach to Mars: October 3, 2023, within approximately 18 million miles (29 million km).</li>
    <li>Comet nucleus size: Estimated between 10 and 30 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>Speed: Traveling at over 42 miles per second (68 km/sec), or approximately 152,000 mph (245,000 km/h).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS network in Chile. It passed Mars on October 3, 2023, coming within approximately 18 million miles. The comet made a close approach to the Sun on October 29, 2023, and is now on a trajectory toward Earth, with its closest approach scheduled for December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is a comet moving at very high speed as it passes through our solar system. We have measured it, we are observing it, and we know very well what is going on,” said Josef Aschbacher, Director of the European Space Agency, in an interview with Europa Press.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third interstellar object documented to enter our solar system. Prior incidents include the comets 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov, both of which have contributed to our understanding of celestial bodies from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further research will focus on analyzing the comet's composition and trajectory, with updates expected following its closest approach.</p>
