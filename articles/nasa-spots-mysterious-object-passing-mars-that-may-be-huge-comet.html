      <h2>NASA spots mysterious object passing Mars that may be huge comet</h2>

<p>A mysterious object captured on camera by NASA's Mars rover Perseverance could be the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which made its closest approach to the Red Planet on October 3, according to the European Space Agency. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it raises interest in interstellar objects and their origins. Currently, space agencies are utilizing various technologies, including the Perseverance rover and telescopes like Hubble and James Webb, to gather data on 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object sighted by Perseverance on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS came within 18.6 million miles of Mars.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun is scheduled for October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may be up to 11.3 kilometres (7 miles) wide.</li>
    <li>Speed during closest approach to the Sun is approximately 209,000 km/h (130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>NASA has not issued a statement confirming the object's identity.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, the Mars rover Perseverance captured images of a cylindrical object streaking across the Martian sky. This event coincided with the closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Mars.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb from the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian explained that the shape seen in the images is a result of the integration time used to create the composite image. The object appeared as a streak due to the movement of 3I/ATLAS across the Martian sky during image capture.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The stripe in the Navcam image must have resulted from stacking hundreds of Navcam images over a total time interval of about 10 minutes."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "3I/ATLAS would have looked like a circular spot for an individual snapshot, which has a maximum exposure time of 3.28 seconds for Navcam."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third interstellar object detected, indicating a growing interest in the study of such celestial bodies. Previous interstellar objects, Oumuamua and Borisov, have also raised questions about their origins and composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Space agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun on October 30, 2023, and will analyze the data collected from various instruments to better understand this interstellar object.</p>
