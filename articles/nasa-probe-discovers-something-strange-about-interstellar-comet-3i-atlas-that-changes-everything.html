      <h2>NASA Probe Discovers Something Strange About Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has tracked the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing important insights about its behavior as it travels through space. The discovery comes as TESS has unexpectedly shifted focus from its primary mission of finding distant exoplanets to studying this unique cosmic visitor.</p>

<p>This finding is significant because it marks the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Researchers believe studying these objects can enhance understanding of the formation and evolution of other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
    <li>TESS can detect brightness changes as small as 0.1 percent.</li>
    <li>This comet has traveled through interstellar space for potentially millions of years.</li>
    <li>Continuous observations by TESS last for weeks or months, unlike ground-based telescopes.</li>
    <li>The data from TESS will help refine detection methods for future interstellar visitors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, ‘Oumuamua became the first confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system. This was followed by comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Now, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed by TESS, providing new data on the behavior of objects from beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>NASA's TESS, originally designed to find distant exoplanets, has shifted its focus to study the comet, allowing scientists to analyze its spin rate and composition. This data is crucial for understanding how such interstellar objects behave during their journeys.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The beauty of using TESS for this work is that we get continuous observations over weeks or months,” said Dr. Michael Rodriguez, an astrophysicist specializing in small solar system bodies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We’re learning that these interstellar objects are more common than we initially thought,” explained Dr. Lisa Park, a mission planner working on deep space exploration concepts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects had been confirmed. Each provides a unique opportunity for scientists to study the processes that shape star systems. The ability to monitor the spin and brightness of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge about the characteristics of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>Research into these cosmic visitors also raises questions about the potential for biological material to travel between star systems, although this remains speculative.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected by TESS to refine their understanding of 3I/ATLAS and improve detection methods for future interstellar objects. The comet will gradually fade from view as it moves away from the sun, making ongoing observations critical.</p>
