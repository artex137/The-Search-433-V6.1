      <h2>Juice probe records intense activity on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with double tail at 66 million km</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency's Juice probe has recorded significant activity from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on November 2, 2025, approximately 66 million kilometers from Earth. The probe captured partial images showing a bright gas halo and two distinct tails as the comet approached its closest point in orbit after perihelion in October.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it provides insights into the interactions between 3I/ATLAS and the Solar System environment. The data gathered will help scientists understand the composition and behavior of this interstellar object, which is considered a time capsule from distant regions of the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: November 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 66 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet's speed: 61 km/s relative to the Sun</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of the gas halo: between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Full data transmission expected: February 2026</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 269 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first seen on July 1, 2025, near the constellations of Serpens Cauda and Sagittarius. After passing through perihelion in October, the comet intensified its release of material. In November, the Juice probe and the Hubble Space Telescope provided images of the comet, showcasing its complex structure and activity.</p>
<p>As of December 2025, the focus has shifted to the post-perihelion trajectory and the comet's interactions with the Solar System environment, with intensive observations scheduled for later this month.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activity of 3I/ATLAS suggests a core rich in organic compounds, with constant release without detected outbreaks until August 2025,” said an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in the Solar System. Its findings contribute to ongoing research about the origins and compositions of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. The comet's multiple tails and complex structure challenge existing cosmic models and enhance our understanding of planetary formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to conduct intensive observations of 3I/ATLAS in December 2025. The full data from the Juice probe will arrive in February 2026, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>
