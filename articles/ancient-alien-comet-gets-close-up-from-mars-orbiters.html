      <h2>Ancient Alien Comet Gets Close-Up from Mars Orbiters</h2>

<p>Two European spacecraft orbiting Mars have captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS, providing humanity's closest view yet of this interstellar comet, which may be over three billion years old. The observations took place between October 1 and 7, 2025, as the comet approached the Red Planet at a distance of 30 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it offers insights into the early solar system and the nature of interstellar comets. The European Space Agency (ESA) is analyzing the images and data collected to better understand the comet's composition and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed by ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express.</li>
    <li>Observation period: October 1 - 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 30 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet age estimated at 7.6 billion years.</li>
    <li>Images show a coma but not the nucleus of the comet.</li>
    <li>Next observation planned by ESA’s Juice spacecraft in November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. The comet's trajectory indicates that it originated from outside our solar system, carrying information about distant planetary systems.</p>

<p>Between October 1 and 7, 2025, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express directed their cameras at the comet, achieving unprecedented observations. While the ExoMars orbiter captured images of the comet's coma, Mars Express did not yield clear images due to shorter exposure times.</p>

<p>In November 2025, ESA’s Juice spacecraft will attempt to observe 3I/ATLAS after its closest approach to the Sun, an event that could enhance the comet's activity and visibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” said Nick Thomas, leader of the camera team for ExoMars. “The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Michael Kueppers, project scientist for ESA’s upcoming Comet Interceptor mission, stated, “Visiting one could provide a breakthrough in understanding their nature.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a rare group of interstellar objects, with only three confirmed since 2017: 1I/’Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and now 3I/ATLAS. These comets differ from those formed in our solar system and provide unique insights into the chemical signatures from distant stars.</p>

<p>The upcoming Comet Interceptor mission, set to launch in 2029, aims to study such interstellar comets in more detail, potentially enhancing our understanding of their origins and compositions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from the Mars orbiters for spectral fingerprints that may reveal the comet's chemical makeup. The results are expected to take months, while the Juice spacecraft will observe 3I/ATLAS in November 2025, with data returning to Earth in February 2026.</p>
