      <h2>US Congress investigates underwater UFOs the size of a ‘football field’</h2>

<p>A senior naval officer has reported a close encounter with a UFO measuring the size of a “football field,” travelling at speeds of 322 kilometres per hour underwater. Tim Burchett, a member of the US Congress, is leading an investigation into sightings of Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs) by military personnel in deep ocean waters. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these sightings.</p>

<p>This investigation matters as it highlights ongoing concerns about unidentified aerial and submerged phenomena, prompting Congress to take action. Officials are examining multiple reports of mystery objects in the ocean, which raises questions about national security and technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reported speeds of the UFO: 200 mph (322 km/h)</li>
    <li>Size of the UFO: Comparable to a football field</li>
    <li>Congressman Tim Burchett is leading the investigation</li>
    <li>Encounters reported in deep water areas of the ocean</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities reported</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, military personnel have reported multiple sightings of USOs in deep ocean waters. The encounters have prompted Congressman Tim Burchett to initiate an investigation into these phenomena. Burchett has stated that a high-ranking naval officer described an encounter with an object travelling at significant speeds underwater.</p>

<p>Burchett has publicly expressed skepticism regarding the idea that these objects are manmade, citing limitations in current military technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“A very high-ranking member of the Navy described some underwater experiences with something that was doing 200mph underwater. It was as big as a football field. That’s no fish.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Not with our technology no. The best we have is probably in the high 30s.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Why would we risk multi-million-dollar apparatus? Why would we put something in the air around our best pilots that could have a crash? Because what these guys are talking about – they’ve come close to collisions. I just don’t think we’d be risking that. That’s my proof that it’s not ours.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This investigation follows a growing trend of military personnel reporting encounters with unidentified aerial and submerged objects. Previous incidents have raised questions about the implications for national security and the potential existence of advanced technology not currently understood by military officials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The investigation by Congressman Burchett and other officials is ongoing, with further inquiries expected into the nature and origins of these unidentified objects. The potential for additional reports and testimonies from military personnel remains high.</p>
