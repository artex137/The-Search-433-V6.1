      <h2>NASA activates defense alert after identifying radio signals from new interstellar visitor</h2>

<p>The identification of a new celestial body, 3I/ATLAS, crossing the solar system at high speed has prompted immediate monitoring protocols by major space agencies worldwide. The event marks the third confirmed visit of an interstellar object to our solar system, following the appearances of ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it serves as a practical exercise for planetary defense systems, testing the readiness of space surveillance technologies. While orbit analyses rule out any risk of collision with Earth, scientists consider the opportunity to study materials formed in other stellar systems invaluable for exoplanetary geology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Detection date: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Diameter estimates: Between 320 meters and five kilometers</li>
    <li>Radio frequency emissions recorded at: 1.6 GHz</li>
    <li>Observatory responsible: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li>Confirmed interstellar nature: Through hyperbolic orbit analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected while crossing the solar system, triggering monitoring protocols among global space agencies. Preliminary data indicated the object is a rocky fragment, likely ejected from its home system millions of years ago. The MeerKAT radio telescope recorded unusual radio emissions during its trajectory, leading to further analysis.</p>

<p>Scientists have confirmed that the emissions are associated with hydrogen lines and are a result of natural energetic processes, not artificial origins. The findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS has a volatile composition or dynamic activity greater than expected for an object that has traveled through the deep vacuum for long periods.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This discovery opens up new possibilities for radio astronomy as a tool for probing interstellar bodies,” said a spokesperson from the Agência Espacial Europeia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Each new detection improves space surveillance strategies and strengthens our ability to identify and react to potential future threats,” stated an official from the Administração Nacional.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The visit of 3I/ATLAS follows the encounters with ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, both of which spurred interest in interstellar objects. These encounters have led to advancements in space surveillance technologies and strategies for planetary defense.</p>

<p>As scientists gather more data, the integration of this information into existing models aims to create a more accurate overview of the diversity of objects in the galaxy. This ongoing research enhances humanity's understanding of the formation of other solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research teams are continuing to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS while it remains within range of terrestrial sensors. The findings will be used to refine existing models and improve space surveillance capabilities for future interstellar encounters.</p>
