      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS Bringing Doomsday Tomorrow? Harvard Expert Breaks Silence</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, sparking speculation about its implications for Earth. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, this object is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>This situation matters because it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have classified the comet as a natural object and are monitoring it closely. They emphasize that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, despite some alarmist claims suggesting otherwise.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (approximately 167 million miles).</li>
    <li>Travels at speeds up to 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter between 1,444 feet and 3.5 miles.</li>
    <li>Monitoring campaign by NASA and ESA scheduled from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile. It reached solar conjunction on October 21, 2025, becoming temporarily invisible from Earth-based telescopes. The comet will achieve perihelion on October 29, 2025, at approximately 1.36 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, positioned between Earth and Mars.</p>
<p>Its closest approach to Earth is projected for December 19, 2025, at a safe distance of 1.8 AU. Monitoring by NASA and ESA has been initiated to refine astrometric techniques rather than respond to an emergency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>, a Harvard astrophysicist, has stated, "Take a vacation before October 29, because who knows what will happen" if the comet exhibits unexpected behavior.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Mainstream astronomers emphasize that "3I/ATLAS's characteristics align with those of a natural interstellar comet."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This comet follows 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019 as the third confirmed interstellar visitor. While some have drawn connections to prophecies or conspiracy theories, experts view these claims as unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity for scientific study, enhancing understanding of interstellar material and planetary formation. Recent observations indicate that the comet's behavior is consistent with natural phenomena, rather than intelligent control.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As observations resume post-perihelion, any deviations from predicted behavior will be closely monitored. Current data indicates no cause for concern regarding global catastrophe.</p>
