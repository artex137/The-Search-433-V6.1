      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-30 16:36 UTC</p>

      <h2>The coincidence that is alarming astronomers about the WOW! signal and comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers at the ATLAS system in Chile detected comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object originating from the same region of the sky as the historic WOW! signal received in August 1977 at the Big Ear radio telescope in Ohio. The WOW! signal, which lasted just 72 seconds, has long puzzled scientists as it appeared to come from the constellation Sagittarius, a location astronomers had been monitoring for extraterrestrial signals.</p>

<p>This discovery has raised significant interest among scientists and has prompted multiple organizations, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), to intensify their observations of 3I/Atlas. The potential link between the comet and the WOW! signal has reignited discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas was detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The WOW! signal was recorded on August 7, 1977.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is approximately three light-days from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory is hyperbolic, confirming it is interstellar.</li>
    <li>The probability of a random coincidence with the WOW! signal is estimated at 0.6 percent, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</li>
    <li>The comet's tail points toward the Sun, contrary to typical comet behavior.</li>
    <li>NASA, ESA, and over 200 observatories are currently monitoring 3I/Atlas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 1977, the WOW! signal was observed by astronomer Jerry Ehman, leading to decades of speculation about its origin. In 2025, 3I/Atlas was detected, and its trajectory and chemical composition confirmed it was not from our solar system. The coincidence of its location with the WOW! signal has led to renewed interest and investigation.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb calculated that the comet was separated from the WOW! signal by only four degrees in right ascension and eight degrees in declination. This close proximity has prompted further analysis of the 1977 data with modern tools.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It acts like a comet. But it also does things no comet should do.”</blockquote>
<p>- Tom Statler, NASA scientist</p>

<blockquote>“It’s weird. Really weird.”</blockquote>
<p>- Chris Lintott, Oxford astronomer</p>

<blockquote>“A time capsule from the birth of the galaxy.”</blockquote>
<p>- Davide Farnocchia, NASA</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The WOW! signal has remained one of the most significant events in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence since its discovery. Comet 3I/Atlas, like previous interstellar objects such as 'Oumuamua' and Borisov, presents unique characteristics that challenge current scientific understanding. The comet's unusual properties have led scientists to reconsider existing theories about comet formation and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA, along with numerous observatories, will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun. Researchers are also analyzing historical data from the WOW! signal in hopes of uncovering new insights. The connection between the comet and the WOW! signal remains under investigation, with future observations expected to provide further clarity.</p>
