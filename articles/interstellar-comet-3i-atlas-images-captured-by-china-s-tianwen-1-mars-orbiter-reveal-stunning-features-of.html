      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Imaged by China's Tianwen 1 Mars Orbiter</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been imaged by China's Tianwen 1 Mars orbiter during its close pass by Mars from October 1 to October 4, 2025. The images reveal significant features of the comet, which was first discovered in July 2025, and made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has stated that the imaging of 3I/ATLAS contributes to global efforts to study this rare interstellar visitor. The successful capture of images demonstrates Tianwen 1's capabilities and provides valuable data for future missions in China's deep-space exploration program.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) wide.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of 129,800 mph (58 kilometers per second).</li>
    <li>The comet was located about 18 million miles (29 million kilometers) from Earth during imaging.</li>
    <li>Images were captured from October 1 to October 4, 2025.</li>
    <li>CNSA published the images on November 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>Tianwen 1 entered Mars orbit in February 2021.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered as the third known interstellar object to visit the solar system. It approaches the Sun, reaching its closest point on October 29, 2025. Between October 1 and October 4, 2025, China's Tianwen 1 Mars orbiter captures images of the comet, which are later published by CNSA on November 5, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet imaging project was an important extension mission for Tianwen 1,” said a CNSA representative. “It provided a chance to perform useful technical tests and accumulate experience for the second mission in China's deep-space exploration series.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third object confirmed to have traveled from another star to our solar system, following ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unexpected brightness as it nears the Sun has raised questions among astronomers. Researchers have noted that the comet's brightening far exceeds typical long-period comets, with the cause still being investigated.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the images and the comet's behavior is ongoing. Researchers continue to explore the unusual brightening of 3I/ATLAS and its implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>
