      <h2>US officials monitor Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS amid government shutdown</h2>

<p>Federal personnel have continued to monitor the interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, despite disruptions caused by the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. The comet, first detected by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in July, is currently being observed by multiple agencies on its hyperbolic path through the solar system.</p>

<p>This monitoring is significant as officials from NASA are scheduled to speak with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna on Wednesday. Luna has requested more imagery and data about the comet. According to sources, NASA's data will be released once operations resume, highlighting the importance of this information for understanding interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is on a hyperbolic trajectory and will reach its closest point to Earth at approximately 1.8 astronomical units (170 million miles).</li>
    <li>Perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, is expected around October 30, 2025, at roughly 1.4 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>NASA has captured images of 3I/ATLAS using the Hubble Space Telescope and other assets.</li>
    <li>The upper limit of the comet’s nucleus is estimated at 3.5 miles in diameter, but it could be as small as 440 meters.</li>
    <li>The International Asteroid Warning Network will collect data on 3I/ATLAS from November 27 to January 27.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope detected Comet 3I/ATLAS for the first time. Since then, NASA and other agencies have monitored its trajectory and characteristics. On October 31, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna wrote to NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy, urging the release of relevant data and imagery. NASA confirmed to DefenseScoop that it continues to observe the comet through its various assets, despite the shutdown.</p>

<p>On November 1, 2025, Rep. Luna is scheduled to discuss the comet with NASA officials and a scientist from Harvard University. The International Asteroid Warning Network has announced its campaign to gather data on the comet starting November 27.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,” Rep. Luna stated in her letter to NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA indicated that “the organization was closed due to a lapse in government funding and that mailboxes were not being monitored.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Pentagon confirmed that its All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) “is following reports relating to 3I/ATLAS closely,” but added that the comet “falls outside of AARO’s mission as the object is assessed to be a comet and therefore is not considered [UAP].”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known object from outside the solar system to be recorded passing through, following the discovery of previous interstellar objects. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicates it did not originate from within the Sun’s gravitational influence. The ongoing monitoring of such objects is crucial for advancing scientific knowledge about their characteristics and potential interactions with our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS and is expected to share findings and imagery once government operations resume. The data collection campaign by the International Asteroid Warning Network will run from November 27 to January 27, further contributing to the scientific understanding of the comet.</p>
