      <h2>Tonight: Catch a rare glimpse of Comet 3I/ATLAS approaching Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object detected by astronomers, will make its closest approach to Earth at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on December 19, passing at a distance of 168 million miles (270 million kilometers). The comet poses no threat to our planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to observe an object from another star system. While the comet is currently moving away from the sun and leaving the solar system, it is not expected to be visible without telescopes due to its distance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: 1 a.m. EST on December 19 (0600 GMT)</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 2025</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/’Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>Live webcast: Virtual Telescope Project in Manciano, Italy, starting at 11 p.m. EST on December 18 (0400 GMT on December 19)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. It is currently moving away from the sun and is expected to leave the solar system. The closest approach to Earth will occur in the early hours of December 19, 2023.</p>
<p>NASA has been monitoring the comet and recently released ultraviolet images captured by its Europa Clipper spacecraft from approximately 102 million miles (164 million kilometers) away. More images from NASA are anticipated following the comet’s close approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Although visible in large astronomy binoculars at magnitude 11, it will appear as a tiny, slightly out-of-focus star,” according to Sky at Night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“A better view can be obtained with a medium-to-large telescope of around 12 inches,” Sky at Night added, noting that observers may see a faint greenish patch of light near the bright star Regulus and the fainter companion Rho Leonis.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet discovered, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of such objects helps scientists understand more about the formation and evolution of our solar system and the wider universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the solar system. Observers are encouraged to utilize telescope apps to locate the comet and participate in the upcoming live webcast.</p>
