      <h2>NASA missions capture multi-platform views of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA spacecraft have collected coordinated observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels inward through the solar system, with a closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2025. The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</p>

<p>This observation campaign is significant as it marks the first coordinated effort by NASA's heliophysics fleet to purposefully observe an object originating from another stellar system. The data gathered will contribute to a better understanding of the comet's composition and behavior as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest approach to Earth at approximately 273 million km (170 million miles) on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet passed Mars at a distance of roughly 30 million km (19 million miles) earlier this autumn.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured high-resolution images of the comet's coma.</li>
    <li>Observations by the Perseverance rover provided faint surface-level detection.</li>
    <li>The Psyche spacecraft obtained images on September 8–9 from about 53 million km (33 million miles).</li>
    <li>Lucy spacecraft recorded exposures on September 16 from approximately 386 million km (240 million miles).</li>
    <li>Hubble, James Webb Space Telescope, and SPHEREx also contributed observations.</li>
    <li>The comet will continue outward, passing the orbit of Jupiter in spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. NASA has been observing the comet as it approaches Earth. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of the coma in October, while the Perseverance rover detected faint surface features. Other NASA spacecraft, including Psyche and Lucy, conducted observations in September.</p>

<p>Between September 11 and October 2, STEREO tracked the comet's trajectory, and the ESA/NASA SOHO mission imaged it from October 15 to 26. The PUNCH mission recorded the developing tail of the comet from late September to early October.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is the first coordinated effort by our heliophysics fleet to purposefully observe an object known to originate in another stellar system,” NASA noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Sun’s gravitational environment. Its hyperbolic orbit confirms its origin from outside the solar system, providing a unique opportunity for scientists to study a comet not originating within our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as viewing geometries allow, providing ongoing data about the comet’s composition and trajectory after its closest approach in December 2025.</p>
