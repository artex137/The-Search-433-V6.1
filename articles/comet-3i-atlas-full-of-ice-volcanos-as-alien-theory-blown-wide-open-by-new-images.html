      <h2>'Comet' 3I/ATLAS full of 'ice volcanos' as alien theory blown wide open by new images</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been found to potentially contain erupting "ice volcanoes" as it moves through our solar system, according to new research published on the preprint server arXiv. Since its detection on July 1, 2025, the comet has intrigued both the public and experts in the field of astrophysics.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS shares characteristics with icy trans-Neptunian objects, which could reshape our understanding of its origin and composition. Researchers are now investigating the implications of these findings and what they reveal about the comet's surface materials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The minimum distance from Earth will be approximately 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Study lead author is Josep Trigo-Rodríguez from the Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC/IEEC).</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has contributed to the research on the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet has shown a "multi-jet structure" in recent images.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, researchers detected 3I/ATLAS as it entered our solar system. Over the following months, the comet exhibited pulsating light with a period of 16.16 hours. In November 2025, Avi Loeb announced the comet's close approach to Earth slated for December 19, 2025, and highlighted its unique multi-jet structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Being a comet formed in a remote planetary system, it is remarkable that the mixture of materials forming the surface of the body has resemblance with trans-Neptunian objects,” said Josep Trigo-Rodríguez, lead author of the study.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This multi-jet structure constitutes a remarkable target for future observations with the Hubble and Webb telescopes,” stated Avi Loeb as he discussed the upcoming close encounter.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, 3I/ATLAS had already garnered attention due to its unusual characteristics as an interstellar object. The comet's behavior and composition have prompted ongoing studies to better understand its origins and the dynamics of celestial bodies that originate from different cosmic environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to utilize the Hubble and Webb telescopes for further observations of 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach, aiming to gather more data on its surface and jet structures.</p>
