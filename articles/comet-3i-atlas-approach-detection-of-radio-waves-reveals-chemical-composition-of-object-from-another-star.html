      <h2>Comet 3I ATLAS approach: Detection of radio waves reveals chemical composition of object from another star</h2>

<p>Scientists from several countries have detected the first radio signal emitted by the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas on October 24, 2025. The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa captured absorption lines of hydroxyl radicals as the comet approached the Sun, marking a significant advance in radio astronomy for bodies originating from outside the Solar System.</p>

<p>This detection is important because it provides insights into the chemical composition of 3I/Atlas, which differs from local comets due to its interstellar origin. Researchers have been monitoring the comet closely to understand its unique characteristics and implications for the study of distant planetary formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of detection: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Telescope used: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li>Frequencies detected: 1,665 GHz and 1,667 GHz</li>
    <li>Current speed of comet: approximately 30 km/s</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: between 3 and 11 kilometers</li>
    <li>Next close approach to Jupiter: March 2026, 50 million kilometers away</li>
    <li>Minimum distance to Earth: 270 million km on December 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS project in Chile. Following its detection, astronomers attempted to capture signals from the comet in September but were unsuccessful. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope successfully detected radio waves emitted by the comet.</p>

<p>Perihelion, the closest approach to the Sun, occurred on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units. Observations on November 11 revealed significant changes in the comet's brightness and tail structure, indicating increased activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection confirms the presence of water and other volatile compounds, essential for understanding the formation of distant planets,” said a lead researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/Atlas exhibits greater non-gravitational acceleration due to jets of gas released from its surface. This unique behavior provides valuable data on the characteristics of interstellar bodies.</p>

<p>Radio astronomy has advanced significantly with this detection, allowing researchers to analyze chemical "fingerprints" of distant objects without the need for physical probes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/Atlas using a global network of observatories. In March 2026, NASA's Juno probe will capture signals from the comet in a closer proximity to Jupiter, focusing on low-frequency emissions to further investigate the comet's temporary atmosphere.</p>
