      <h2>3I/ATLAS is Bluer Than the Sun: New Observations Defy Earlier Color Data</h2>

<p>New space-based images have revealed that comet 3I/ATLAS has become significantly brighter and bluer than the Sun as it approaches its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on 29 October 2025. The comet is currently obscured from Earth-based telescopes due to its position behind the Sun's glare.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it challenges previous scientific understanding of comet behavior. Several space observatories, including NASA's STEREO-A spacecraft, the SOHO observatory, and the GOES-19 weather satellite, have continued to track 3I/ATLAS, capturing detailed observations that defy earlier color data. Scientists are particularly interested in the change in the object's color from red to distinctly blue.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is currently hidden from Earth-based telescopes.</li>
    <li>Space observatories involved in tracking include NASA's STEREO-A, SOHO, and GOES-19.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has shown rapid brightening as it nears the Sun, far exceeding typical comet behavior.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between September and October 2025, data from various instruments, including STEREO-A’s twin cameras and SOHO’s LASCO C3 coronagraph, recorded an unusual brightening pattern of 3I/ATLAS. The brightness increase occurred rapidly as the comet approached the Sun, with its glow intensifying significantly.</p>
<p>As of mid-November 2025, 3I/ATLAS is expected to gradually become visible from Earth again, culminating in its closest approach on 19 December 2025, when follow-up observations are planned using telescopes like Hubble and James Webb.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Whether 3I/ATLAS's behaviour is due to the laws of nature or to deliberate design, we are witnessing something that doesn't fit the ordinary patterns of comets or asteroids,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery marks a significant departure from typical comet behavior, which usually involves gradual brightening without dramatic color changes. Earlier analyses had classified 3I/ATLAS as a dusty or carbon-rich body based on its red appearance in previous observations.</p>
<p>The current findings indicate that the comet may be composed of unfamiliar materials, raising questions about its origins and composition, particularly as it survives close solar encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After perihelion, astronomers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible again in mid-November. The upcoming observations are expected to provide further insights into the unusual properties of this interstellar visitor.</p>
