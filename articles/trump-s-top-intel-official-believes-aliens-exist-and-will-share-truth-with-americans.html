      <h2>Trump's top intel official believes aliens exist and will share 'truth' with Americans</h2>

<p>John Ratcliffe, former Director of National Intelligence under Donald Trump, has stated that he believes aliens exist and that the U.S. government will eventually disclose information about them to the public. Ratcliffe made these comments during an interview on a news program aired on March 5, 2023.</p>

<p>This statement is significant as it reflects a growing interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the government's approach to transparency regarding such matters. Authorities have been under pressure to provide more information following a series of reports and congressional hearings on UAP sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>John Ratcliffe served as Director of National Intelligence from May 2020 to January 2021.</li>
    <li>His comments about aliens were made on March 5, 2023.</li>
    <li>Ratcliffe indicated that the government has information that has not yet been shared with the public.</li>
    <li>UAP have gained increased attention from lawmakers and the public in recent years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been an increase in reports of UAP sightings. The U.S. government has conducted investigations and held hearings to discuss these phenomena. In 2020, the Pentagon established the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force to evaluate reports of UAP.</p>

<p>In June 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report that examined 144 UAP sightings by military personnel between 2004 and 2021, with limited information available on 143 of those incidents.</p>

<p>On March 5, 2023, John Ratcliffe, in a televised interview, expressed his belief that aliens exist and hinted at the existence of undisclosed government information related to these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have a lot of evidence to suggest that there are things that are not from this world,” Ratcliffe said during the interview.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I think that the government has information that they haven’t shared with the public yet,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UAP has surged following several high-profile sightings and leaks of military footage. The U.S. government has faced calls for greater transparency regarding its investigations into these phenomena, leading to the establishment of dedicated task forces and reports.</p>

<p>The conversation surrounding UAP has evolved, with former officials and lawmakers advocating for more openness about what the government knows.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<pAs investigations into UAP continue, further disclosures from the government may be forthcoming, as lawmakers seek more information on the subject.</p>
