      <h2>US Government Addresses Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Amid Shutdown</h2>

<p>Federal agencies have continued to monitor the interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS despite the U.S. government shutdown that began on October 1, 2023. The comet, which has garnered significant attention due to its unique properties, was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile in July 2023.</p>

<p>The importance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its classification as one of only three interstellar objects recorded to date. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, have classified the comet as a natural phenomenon, rejecting claims of extraterrestrial origins. Representative Anna Paulina Luna of Florida has requested additional data from NASA to aid in understanding the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 2023</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to the Sun: October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Speed: Highest recorded speed for an object of its kind</li>
    <li>Government Shutdown Start Date: October 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Congressional Request Date: October 31, 2023</li>
    <li>Data Collection Campaign: November 27, 2023, to January 27, 2024</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in July 2023. The comet's closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 29, 2023. Following the discovery, the U.S. government entered a shutdown on October 1, affecting NASA's operations. On October 31, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna requested further information from NASA regarding 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>Despite the shutdown, NASA has confirmed that it is tracking the comet and plans to discuss findings with Rep. Luna's team. The agency intends to share findings once operations resume.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS might indicate it could be an alien probe,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard University professor, adding that this claim is met with skepticism.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Such information is vital for understanding interstellar visitors,” Rep. Luna emphasized in her request to NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three interstellar objects identified to date. Previous interstellar objects, including 'Oumuamua in 2017, have also sparked debate about their origins and characteristics. NASA and the European Space Agency have consistently classified these objects as natural phenomena, countering theories about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to conduct data collection campaigns on 3I/ATLAS from November 27, 2023, to January 27, 2024, focusing on its brightness changes and any signs of unusual acceleration. Further communications between NASA and Congress are anticipated once the government reopens.</p>
