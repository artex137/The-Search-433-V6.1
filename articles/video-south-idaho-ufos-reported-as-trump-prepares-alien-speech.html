      <h2>VIDEO: South Idaho UFOs Reported As Trump Prepares Alien Speech</h2>

<p>Reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) have emerged in Idaho, coinciding with President Donald Trump’s announcement of a forthcoming speech on extraterrestrial life. The sighting occurred northwest of Twin Falls in Robie Creek on the evening of February 6 at approximately 6:05 P.M. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as it aligns with a heightened national interest in UFOs, particularly with the president's plan to release classified documents regarding potential evidence of extraterrestrial beings. The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) has conducted an investigation into the Robie Creek sighting, which has drawn media attention.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
