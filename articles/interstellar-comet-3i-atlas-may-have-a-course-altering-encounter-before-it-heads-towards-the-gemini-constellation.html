      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS May Have Course-Altering Encounter</h2>

<p>A new pre-print paper indicates that comet 3I/ATLAS may undergo a significant close encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026, before it exits the Solar System. The study details dynamical simulations of the interstellar comet, which was first observed on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</p>

<p>This research is significant as it provides insights into the comet's trajectory and its origins, which could enhance our understanding of interstellar objects. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed and aims to model the past and future paths of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It travels at a velocity of approximately 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>It is predicted to have a close encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory suggests it is moving from the Sagittarius constellation towards the Gemini constellation.</li>
    <li>Its distance from Jupiter during the encounter will be very close to Jupiter's Hill radius (0.355 au).</li>
    <li>The optimal observation period for the comet is from March 9 to March 22, 2026.</li>
    <li>The study is available on the pre-print server arXiv.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, ATLAS detected comet 3I/ATLAS, confirming it as the third known interstellar object. The detection led to various studies analyzing its trajectory and origins.</p>
<p>The recent pre-print paper, focused on dynamical simulations, has modeled the comet's path and potential close encounters, particularly with Jupiter.</p>
<p>On March 16, 2026, the comet is expected to have a close approach to Jupiter, which could alter its course significantly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This thing's coming in much faster than the other two, but it is actually within the range of velocities that we would predict in objects,” said Chris Lintott, Professor of Astrophysics and Citizen Science Lead at the University of Oxford. “Our model predicts that it's from a star in the thick disc of the galaxy.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The possible location of the comet 3I is found to be in the transition zone from the thin to the thick disk. [But] it is uncertain to confirm the region of origin using kinematic information,” the research team noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous studies suggest that 3I/ATLAS may have traveled alone for up to 10 billion years before entering the Solar System. Its origins remain uncertain, with indications it may have come from the Milky Way's "thick disk."</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations are needed to determine the comet's non-gravitational acceleration and how it may affect its trajectory. The best opportunity for observation will occur in March 2026 as it approaches Jupiter.</p>
