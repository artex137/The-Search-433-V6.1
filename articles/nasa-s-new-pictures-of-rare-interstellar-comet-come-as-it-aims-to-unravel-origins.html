      <h2>NASA’s new pictures of rare interstellar comet come as it aims to unravel origins</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of the interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS, which is making a one-time journey through Earth’s solar system. The latest images were revealed on Wednesday, taken when the comet was approximately 190 million miles from Earth, according to NASA officials.</p>

<p>This release is significant as 3I/ATLAS is one of only three interstellar comets confirmed to have passed through the solar system. Scientists are working to determine its origins and characteristics. The comet, first discovered in July, is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently about 190 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>It was first discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2023, at approximately 170 million miles away.</li>
    <li>A team of 20 NASA scientists is studying the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be between 440 and 1,600 metres across.</li>
    <li>NASA has dismissed claims that the comet is of alien origin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023. It was photographed in August when it was around 277 million miles from Earth. About a month ago, images captured by Mars orbiters showed the comet at a distance of approximately 18.6 million miles from Mars.</p>
<p>NASA's latest images were taken from Manciano, Italy, and show the comet as it travels through space. The European Space Agency's Juice Spacecraft has also been testing its cameras on 3I/ATLAS this month.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it’s a fascinating and rare opportunity,” said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, NASA’s acting astrophysics director.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it’s a window into the deep past,” said NASA scientist Tom Statler.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third confirmed interstellar comet to pass through the solar system. This provides a unique opportunity for scientists to study materials from beyond our solar system and compare them to those from our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue tracking 3I/ATLAS as it crosses Jupiter's orbit in spring 2024. Data from the European Space Agency’s Juice Spacecraft will be available in February 2024, which will aid in the ongoing study of the comet.</p>
