      <h2>3I/ATLAS anomaly: Stable, collimated jets at 1 million km intrigue scientists about their unusual nature</h2>

<p>Researchers have reported a new anomaly involving the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has shown stable, collimated jets of material extending over one million kilometers. This discovery adds to the growing list of unusual behaviors exhibited by the comet since its discovery in July 2025.</p>

<p>The stability of these jets challenges current understanding of cometary dynamics and has sparked discussions among scientists about the object's nature and composition. Authorities in the scientific community are now seeking data from advanced telescopes to confirm the observations and explore potential mechanisms behind the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 2025</li>
    <li>Jet Length: Over 1 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated Jet Speed: 3 to 5 km/s</li>
    <li>Rotation Period: Every 16 hours</li>
    <li>Notable Composition: Cyanide and nickel tetracarbonyl</li>
    <li>Next Expected Departure from Solar System: 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, quickly capturing the attention of scientists due to its interstellar origin. Observations have since revealed that the jets of material it expels remain stable and straight, defying traditional cometary physics. As researchers continue to study the object, they have noted its unusual composition and the potential implications for understanding interstellar chemistry.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The maintenance of collimation of the 3I/ATLAS jets indicates that the force generating the propulsion overcomes the effects of Coriolis and rotation-induced blur,” said a lead researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This line of reasoning suggests that 3I/ATLAS may utilize a directed propulsion system, rather than relying solely on ice sublimation,” the researcher added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the Solar System. Its characteristics, including a size comparable to Manhattan and a rare orbital plane, distinguish it from other comets. The object has shown other anomalies, such as a lack of a traditional tail and a unique chemical composition, which may point to different formation conditions in distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its exit from the Solar System in 2026, astronomers are prioritizing observations to gather more data on the jets and assess their stability over time. Medium telescopes will be required for pre-dawn detection as efforts continue to unravel the mysteries surrounding this interstellar body.</p>
