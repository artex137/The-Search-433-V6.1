      <h2>3I/ATLAS Nucleus Intact: New Image Defies Heavy Solar Flare Impact</h2>

<p>New images have confirmed that the nucleus of comet 3I/ATLAS remains intact after its close approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025. Astronomers captured the images on 11 November near La Palma in the Canary Islands, dispelling fears that harsh solar flares would damage its core.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as many experts had warned that 3I/ATLAS might break apart due to the intense solar activity during its perihelion. Authorities in the field of astronomy are now analyzing the images to better understand the comet's resilience and the implications for similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed near the Sun on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Images showing the intact nucleus were taken on 11 November 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted at the Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma.</li>
    <li>Material around 3I/ATLAS extended nearly one million kilometres sunward.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun during perihelion was approximately 203 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Previous perihelion for C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) occurred on 8 October 2025, resulting in fragmentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 29 October 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun. Experts expressed concerns regarding the comet's structural integrity due to expected solar flares. On 11 November 2025, new images captured the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS, confirming it remained intact. Observations revealed significant jet activity around the comet, raising questions about its survival.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, stated, “Images showed one body after perihelion,” highlighting the unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Darryl Seligman from Michigan State University remarked, “Survival matched a one-kilometre scale nucleus,” indicating that the comet's behavior could still be explained as natural despite its unusual features.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is a dynamically new comet, which typically face risks of disintegration during close solar passages. Many comets do not survive such encounters. For instance, C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) fractured after its perihelion due to its closer proximity to the Sun, which was nearly four times nearer than 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as they investigate its unusual characteristics and the implications for future studies of similar comets.</p>
