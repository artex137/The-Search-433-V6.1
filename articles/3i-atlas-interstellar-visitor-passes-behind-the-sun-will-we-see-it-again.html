      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Interstellar visitor passes behind the Sun - will we see it again?</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, in the early hours of Thursday, October 30, 2025, New Zealand time. The comet is now moving away from our solar system and is not currently visible from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system. Scientists are interested in its composition and behavior, particularly as it is expected to return to visibility from Earth in mid-November. Observatories and amateur astronomers are preparing to observe the comet once it re-emerges from behind the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion at a distance of 202 million kilometres from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The average distance from Earth to the Sun is about 150 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in early July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at a speed of 209,000 kph.</li>
    <li>It is estimated to be between 320 metres and 5.6 kilometres across.</li>
    <li>It is expected to be visible again from mid-November 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate the presence of hydroxyl gas and nickel in the comet's coma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed in early July 2025. It became obscured by the Sun's glare at the end of September 2025. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 202 million kilometres from the Sun. It is anticipated to reappear in mid-November 2025, becoming visible to amateur astronomers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As a comet nears the Sun, the growing warmth causes ices on its surface to sublimate and it begins outgassing, growing a cloud called a coma around its nucleus,” according to Science.com.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA described the comet's speed as “staggering,” noting it has been drifting through interstellar space for “many billions of years.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 1I/2017 U1, known as ‘Oumuamua, and 2I/Borisov. These objects provide valuable insights into the composition of materials beyond our solar system and the potential for interstellar exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists and astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. Observations from various telescopes are expected to resume in mid-November 2025, allowing for further study of this interstellar visitor.</p>
