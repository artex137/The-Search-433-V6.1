      <h2>What is 3I/ATLAS? Could the Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS really be an alien mothership? Scientists brace for October 29 mystery</h2>

<p>As the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest pass by the Sun on October 29, 2025, excitement and controversy have emerged within the scientific community. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. While most astronomers regard it as a natural celestial visitor, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has raised the possibility that it could be an alien mothership.</p>

<p>This situation matters because the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS challenge existing scientific understanding of comets. As the comet approaches solar conjunction on October 21 and perihelion on October 29, it will become invisible from Earth, raising the stakes for scientists trying to observe its behavior during this critical period.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Solar conjunction:</strong> October 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>First observed by:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar comets:</strong> 2 (Oumuamua in 2017, 2I/Borisov in 2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Notable emissions:</strong> Nickel gas without iron</li>
    <li><strong>Upcoming observations:</strong> Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Jupiter’s Juno spacecraft between October 30 and March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS. The comet has since exhibited unusual traits, including nickel emissions and a mysterious anti-tail. As it approaches solar conjunction on October 21, it will become invisible to telescopes on Earth. The perihelion on October 29 marks its closest approach to the Sun, further complicating observations.</p>

<p>During this time, speculation has arisen regarding its potential as an artificial object. Avi Loeb has suggested that if 3I/ATLAS were an artificial probe, it might perform an “Oberth maneuver” to alter its trajectory while out of sight.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Take your vacation before October 29. Who knows what might happen?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA’s Tom Statler countered, “The evidence strongly supports 3I/ATLAS being a natural comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins a growing list of interstellar objects, which have sparked interest and debate about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. While some scientists, like Loeb, entertain the idea of artificial origins, the majority of the scientific community maintains that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a natural comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following perihelion, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Juno are expected to capture images of 3I/ATLAS, providing further insights into its composition and behavior. The scientific community will continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and characteristics as it travels deeper into space.</p>
