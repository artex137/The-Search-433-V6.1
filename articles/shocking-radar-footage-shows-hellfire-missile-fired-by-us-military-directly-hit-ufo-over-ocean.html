      <h2>Shocking radar footage shows Hellfire missile fired by US military directly hit UFO over ocean</h2>

<p>The House Committee on Restoring Public Trust has unveiled radar footage showing a US military Hellfire missile striking a UFO over the ocean, during a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. The incident occurred on October 30, 2024, off the coast of Yemen, and no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This revelation raises questions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the military's engagement with them. Authorities are now reviewing the footage and assessing the implications of such encounters, as well as the need for further transparency regarding UAP incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on October 30, 2024.</li>
    <li>Footage shows a Hellfire missile fired from an MQ-9 drone.</li>
    <li>The missile struck a glowing orb, which then bounced off and continued flying.</li>
    <li>Radar footage was presented by Rep. Eric Burlison (R-MO).</li>
    <li>Testimonies were given by Air Force veteran whistleblowers at the hearing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a US military MQ-9 drone fired a Hellfire missile at a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen. The missile made contact with the object but did not appear to affect it, according to radar footage presented during a congressional hearing. The footage was shared by Rep. Eric Burlison on September 9, 2025.</p>

<p>During the same hearing, two Air Force veterans provided testimonies about their experiences with UAPs. Jeffrey Nuccetelli described witnessing a large rectangular craft while stationed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, while Dylan Borland recounted seeing a massive triangular UFO at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in 2012.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There’s a server where there’s a whole bank of these kinds of videos that Congress has not been allowed to see — that the public has not been allowed to see,” said UFO expert George Knapp during the hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are cavemen throwing rocks to these things. It’s obviously not armed and/or aggressive. We are embarrassing ourselves,” Knapp added regarding the missile strike.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader discussion about UAPs and military encounters. Recent years have seen increased public interest and governmental scrutiny regarding such phenomena, with calls for transparency from both officials and the public. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has been tasked with investigating these reports.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue reviewing the footage and testimonies presented during the hearing. Further investigations into UAP encounters and military protocols may follow as officials seek to understand the implications of these incidents.</p>
