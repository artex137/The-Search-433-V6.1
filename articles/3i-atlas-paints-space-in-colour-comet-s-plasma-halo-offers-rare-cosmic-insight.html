      <h2>3I/ATLAS Paints Space in Colour: Comet's Plasma Halo Offers Rare Cosmic Insight</h2>

<p>A remarkable celestial event involving the comet 3I/ATLAS has provided astronomers with an unprecedented view of the universe, revealing a vibrant plasma halo. This event occurred on 9 December, when a photograph was taken using the Canary One 0.5-metre telescope, showcasing the comet's charged particles and their interaction with solar light.</p>

<p>The discovery is significant as it enhances understanding of the mechanics of space and the dynamic processes within our solar system. Avi Loeb, who authored a piece titled "Charged Particles Map of 3I/ATLAS," noted that the new image offers a nearly complete depiction of the comet's charged particles, marking a notable advancement in astronomical observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: 9 December</li>
    <li>Telescope used: Canary One 0.5-metre</li>
    <li>Comet speed: 60–70 km/s</li>
    <li>Photograph revealed distinct colour zones: blue-violet, yellow-orange, and green</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is the author of the analysis on the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 9 December, astronomers captured an image of comet 3I/ATLAS using the Canary One 0.5-metre telescope. The photograph displayed a vibrant plasma halo and distinct colour zones, leading to further analysis by Avi Loeb.</p>
<p>Loeb highlighted the significance of the image, stating it provided a clear view of the charged particles surrounding the comet. He also discussed the implications of the colour variations resulting from the interactions between solar light and the comet's gaseous envelope.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I have never seen clearly separated blue or orange-red regions around 3I/ATLAS until today,” said Avi Loeb. “What we see here is incredible.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation contributes to ongoing research into the interactions between solar winds and comets. Previous studies have primarily revealed yellow-green shades within the inner comas of comets, making this discovery particularly notable for its clarity and colour diversity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb plans to continue his research into the implications of the charge-exchange interactions observed in 3I/ATLAS, potentially leading to further insights into the behaviour of interstellar objects and their interactions with solar phenomena.</p>
