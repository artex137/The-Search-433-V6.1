      <h2>Comet K1/ATLAS Crumbles, Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Delights</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has begun to disintegrate while interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS shines unexpectedly bright in the sky, as reported by astronomers on November 10, 2025. Observers have noted that K1/ATLAS, discovered in May 2025, is breaking apart into at least three visible fragments.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for astronomers and enthusiasts to witness the disintegration of a comet. The ongoing observations allow for a better understanding of comet behavior and dynamics as they approach the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet K1/ATLAS is currently a 10th-magnitude object visible from 2 a.m. to dawn local time.</li>
    <li>The comet's perihelion passage occurred on October 8, 2025, at a distance of 49 million kilometers (31 million miles) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Observers report that K1/ATLAS has produced two brightness outbursts between October 31 and November 4, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed at a brightness of magnitude 9.8, making it visible in a 6-inch telescope.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently passing through the eastern sky in Virgo, close to the star Gamma (γ) Virginis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 8, 2025, Comet K1/ATLAS reached its closest approach to the Sun. Following this, the comet exhibited two bright outbursts between October 31 and November 4, prompting further observation.</p>
<p>On November 10, astronomers noted that K1/ATLAS had split into multiple fragments. The same day, observations confirmed that interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS was brighter than initially expected, leading to excitement among skywatchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Observers can use this unique opportunity to watch the process unfold,” said astronomers tracking K1/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS has exceeded early brightness predictions, which is a delightful surprise for astronomers,” a local astronomer noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are fragile bodies made of ice and dust that can disintegrate as they approach the Sun due to heat and gravitational forces. The recent disintegration of K1/ATLAS highlights the volatile nature of comets, similar to what occurred with C/2024 G3 (ATLAS), which also lost its nucleus.</p>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS are rare visitors from outside our solar system, providing unique insights into the materials and conditions of other parts of the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers will continue to monitor both comets as K1/ATLAS potentially disintegrates further and 3I/ATLAS remains visible in the morning sky until at least November 21, 2025. Astronomers will track the evolution of K1/ATLAS and its fragments in the coming weeks.</p>
