      <h2>Massive UFO Reported to Be Hiding in Plain Sight</h2>
<p>A massive unidentified flying object (UFO) is reportedly concealed in a secret location overseas, according to claims made by United States Congressman Eric Burlison on Monday. The facility, which is allegedly located on the outskirts of Seoul, South Korea, has been described as being "guarded like it’s some kind of commodity." Burlison has stated that former President Donald Trump has been "fully briefed" on the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This revelation has sparked interest in UFO phenomena and the potential existence of alien life. Authorities and researchers are now examining the claims, with some disputing the assertions made by Burlison and others in the UFO community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Alleged UFO facility on the outskirts of Seoul, South Korea</li>
    <li>Diameter of the structure: Approximately 270 feet</li>
    <li>Congressman Eric Burlison made the claims on October 23, 2023</li>
    <li>Claims about the facility date back to a November 2022 interview with journalist Ross Coulthart</li>
    <li>South Korean researcher disputes UFO connection, stating the facility dates back to the 1970s</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2022, investigative journalist Ross Coulthart claimed in an interview that the United States possessed an extraterrestrial craft. This assertion has since gained traction within UFO and UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) communities.</p>
<p>On October 23, 2023, Congressman Eric Burlison discussed the alleged UFO during an interview on Newsmax, emphasizing the bureaucratic challenges faced in accessing UAP-related sites.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I’m not going to mention the country because I heard of it inside of a closed setting, and I want to protect my classification level,” Burlison said during the interview.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If I come under any hard evidence, whether it’s physical or video evidence that is absolutely definitive, I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe,” Burlison stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions surrounding UFOs have been fueled by claims made by various public figures, including former Presidents. Despite official denials from the U.S. government and Pentagon regarding the recovery of alien life, Congress has heard testimonies from whistleblowers about secret state programs related to UFOs.</p>
<p>Former President Barack Obama recently remarked on the existence of aliens, stating, “They’re real but I haven’t seen them,” while dismissing the notion that they are housed in Area 51.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to investigate the claims made by Burlison and other sources. The congressman remains committed to uncovering evidence of extraterrestrial life, despite bureaucratic obstacles hindering access to relevant sites.</p>
