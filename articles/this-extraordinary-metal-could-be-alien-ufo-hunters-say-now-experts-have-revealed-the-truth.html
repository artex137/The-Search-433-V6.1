      <h2>This ‘Extraordinary’ Metal Could Be Alien, UFO Hunters Say. Now Experts Have Revealed the Truth.</h2>

<p>A mysterious metal shard, believed to be from a UFO that crashed in 1947, has captured public interest as scientists investigate its origins and properties. The All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have conducted analyses revealing the shard is primarily composed of magnesium and zinc, with no evidence of extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<p>This investigation matters because it addresses longstanding questions about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. AARO is focused on understanding the physical and chemical properties of the shard to determine its potential capabilities, specifically regarding inertial mass reduction, or levitation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sample believed to be linked to the 1947 Roswell incident.</li>
    <li>Investigated by AARO and ORNL starting in 2022.</li>
    <li>Main components: magnesium, zinc, bismuth, and lead.</li>
    <li>No evidence of alien biosignatures found.</li>
    <li>Magnesium isotopic signatures indicate terrestrial origin.</li>
    <li>Study revealed multiple layers of bismuth, not suitable for waveguide use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The metal shard is believed to have fallen to Earth in 1947, coinciding with the Roswell incident, where a supposed UFO crash sparked widespread speculation about extraterrestrial life. Over the decades, the origins of the shard have been debated until the To the Stars Academy, led by Tom DeLonge, obtained the specimen. In 2022, AARO tasked ORNL with conducting a detailed analysis of the sample to determine its composition and potential applications.</p>

<p>ORNL scientists found that the isotopic signatures of magnesium and lead matched those found on Earth, indicating the sample is not of alien origin. They further analyzed the crystalline structure and concluded that the sample resembled magnesium alloys manufactured on Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on the technologies developed by humans, waveguides can only channel radiation for purposes of communication, data collection, or heating but the conjecture for the UAP was that they were used for levitation,” said Harvard University theoretical physicist Avi Loeb, PhD, who was not involved in the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“ORNL has a high level of confidence that all data indicate the material was manufactured terrestrially—albeit using an uncommon mixture of elements by today’s standards,” according to the report.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To the Stars Academy stated, “The reports do not offer a firm conclusion as to the origin and purpose of the material along with other seeming anomalies. [To the Stars] has more questions about both reports.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The analysis of this metal shard is part of a broader effort to understand UAPs and their potential implications. Previous incidents, like the Roswell crash, have fueled public fascination with the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The scientific community continues to explore materials that may provide evidence of alien technology, although findings often point to terrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>To the Stars Academy plans to meet with ORNL scientists to discuss the findings in detail. Further investigations may follow as researchers seek to clarify the origin and purpose of the shard, though no timeline for additional studies has been disclosed.</p>
