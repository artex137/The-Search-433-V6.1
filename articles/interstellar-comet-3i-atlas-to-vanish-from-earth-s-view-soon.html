      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to Vanish from Earth’s View Soon</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to disappear from Earth’s view as it approaches the Sun, according to astronomers. Discovered by the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, this comet is the third interstellar visitor documented in our solar system.</p>

<p>This event matters as it presents a unique opportunity for astronomers to study the comet's characteristics before it becomes too close to the Sun for observations. Ground-based observatories will monitor 3I/ATLAS until the end of September, after which visibility will cease until early December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2023, by NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Sun: October 30, 2023, approximately 130 million miles away</li>
    <li>Weight: Estimated at around 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Research study: Involved over 4,000 observations, co-authored by Avi Loeb from Harvard University</li>
    <li>Visibility resumes: Early December 2023, after passing behind the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope first identified comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, extensive research has been conducted to understand its characteristics. Ground-based observatories will continue to monitor the comet until the end of September 2023.</p>
<p>Following its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2023, observations will resume in early December 2023, post its passage behind the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, co-author of the study, stated that “the object could potentially be more than just a typical comet, raising questions about its origin and composition.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is noted for being significantly larger than previous interstellar comets, 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Preliminary studies suggest it has an unusual chemical composition, which could lead to new insights into the nature of such celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are set to continue tracking comet 3I/ATLAS using spacecraft. Future observations may involve NASA’s HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in October 2023 and NASA’s Juno spacecraft in March 2026.</p>
