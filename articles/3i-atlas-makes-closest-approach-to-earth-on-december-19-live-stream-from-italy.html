      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS makes closest approach to Earth on December 19, live stream from Italy</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 06:00 UTC (01:00 EST), according to the Virtual Telescope Project. The comet will be about 1.8 AU, or 270 million km, from Earth at that time.</p>

<p>This event is significant for both the scientific community and the public, as 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system. The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a live stream of the event, starting at 04:00 UTC on December 19 (23:00 EST on December 18).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Time of closest approach:</strong> 06:00 UTC (01:00 EST)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 1.8 AU (270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>First observed:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery of water:</strong> Detected by Auburn University physicists using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory</li>
    <li><strong>Closest observation:</strong> Recorded by ESA’s ExoMars TGO and Mars Express on October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> Reached on October 29, 2025, at 11:47 UTC</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted by the ATLAS survey in Chile on July 1, 2025. On October 3, 2025, the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express spacecraft captured images of the comet from a distance of about 30 million km. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a heliocentric distance of approximately 1.356 AU.</p>

<p>In December 2025, the comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth, creating excitement among astronomers and the public alike. A live stream of the event will allow viewers to witness this celestial occurrence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of water in 3I/ATLAS marks a significant milestone in our understanding of interstellar objects,” said a representative from Auburn University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following the well-known Oumuamua and Borisov. Its observations have generated interest in potential extraterrestrial origins, especially after a paper co-authored by Harvard professor Avi Loeb suggested the possibility of it being an alien spaceship.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. The live stream on December 19 will provide an opportunity for real-time observation and analysis of this interstellar visitor.</p>
