      <h2>Extensive UFO collection lands in Vancouver to be auctioned off</h2>

<p>Jeff Schwarz has announced the auction of a large UFO collection from a California film producer at his Direct Liquidation warehouse in East Vancouver. The auction is set to take place in the upcoming weeks, although specific dates have not been disclosed.</p>

<p>This collection is significant due to its historical content, which includes rare materials related to UFOs and government documents. Schwarz, known for his work on the reality TV series The Liquidator, believes the collection will attract considerable interest from both enthusiasts and skeptics alike.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Direct Liquidation warehouse, East Vancouver</li>
    <li>Collection owner: Chris Wyatt, a California documentary producer</li>
    <li>Key items: 1947 Roswell Air Force Base yearbook, UFO photos, government documents</li>
    <li>Documentary titles: “UFOs: Above and Beyond” (1997), “Close Encounters: Proof of Alien Contact” (2000)</li>
    <li>Notable photographs: UFO sighting in Vancouver on October 17, 1992</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Chris Wyatt began collecting UFO-related materials, including interviews and photographs, after producing documentaries in the late 1990s. In 1997, he visited Roswell, New Mexico, where he met military officers connected to the alleged 1947 UFO incident. Wyatt claims to have received a rare yearbook from one officer, who feared the military's cover-up would be exposed.</p>

<p>In recent months, Wyatt decided to auction the collection, leading to the collaboration with Jeff Schwarz to handle the event in Vancouver. The decision to hold the auction at Direct Liquidation was influenced by the variety of items sold there.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s extremely historically important,” said Chris Wyatt. “The yearbook shows everyone who was at the base at the time of the UFO incident.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I think people are going to think I’m completely crazy,” said Jeff Schwarz. “But it needs to be seen. And once people see it, they’re going to understand it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Roswell incident remains a focal point in UFO lore, with many believing it involved the recovery of extraterrestrial materials. The yearbook in Wyatt's collection is considered significant due to claims that the military attempted to destroy copies to prevent public scrutiny. Collectors and enthusiasts often seek rare artifacts related to such events, which contribute to ongoing discussions about UFOs and government transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The exact date for the auction has not been disclosed, but interest from the public is expected to grow as word spreads about the collection's unique contents. Schwarz aims to showcase the artifacts to a broader audience, emphasizing the importance of sharing this historical material.</p>
