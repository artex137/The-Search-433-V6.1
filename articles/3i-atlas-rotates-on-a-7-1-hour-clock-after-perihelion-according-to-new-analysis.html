      <h2>3I/ATLAS Rotates On A 7.1 Hour Clock After Perihelion, According to New Analysis</h2>

<p>A new analysis has revealed that comet 3I/ATLAS continues to rotate approximately every 7.1 hours following its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025. The findings were reported by astronomer Avi Loeb and co-author Toni Scarmato, based on observations made using the Hubble Space Telescope and data collected from an observatory in Italy.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as perihelion passages often alter the behavior of comets, potentially changing their rotation speed, triggering new jets, or causing structural instability. The results indicate that the rotation period of 3I/ATLAS has not undergone a major change since its perihelion, suggesting stability in its rotation characteristics post-encounter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The analysis indicates a rotation period of approximately 7.1 hours.</li>
    <li>Observations were made using the Hubble Space Telescope from November 20 to December 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>Brightness data was collected from the MPC L92 observatory in Calabria, Italy, between December 9 and December 22, 2025.</li>
    <li>Measurements showed periodic changes in jet orientation and brightness fluctuations of roughly ±30 percent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun. Following this event, astronomers began detailed observations to assess any changes in its rotation and behavior.</p>
<p>From November 20 to December 27, 2025, researchers utilized the Hubble Space Telescope to analyze the comet's jet orientation. This revealed subtle wobbles in the anti-sunward jet's position.</p>
<p>Additionally, from December 9 to December 22, 2025, brightness measurements from Calabria, Italy, confirmed fluctuations that aligned with the findings from the Hubble observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The close agreement between the two methods supports a post-perihelion rotation period of about seven hours." </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Perihelion passages are critical events in the study of comets, as they can significantly influence their physical characteristics. Previous encounters with other comets have shown that such close approaches can lead to changes in rotation and the development of new jets, making the stability of 3I/ATLAS notable.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its behavior and any potential changes that may occur in the future.</p>
