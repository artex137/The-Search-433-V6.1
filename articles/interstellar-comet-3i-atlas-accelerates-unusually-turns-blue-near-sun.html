      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS accelerates unusually, turns blue near Sun</h2>

<p>A massive interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has exhibited unexpected acceleration and turned blue as it approached the Sun, according to scientists. The comet made its closest approach on October 30, 2025, and is currently behind the Sun, limiting visibility for ground-based telescopes.</p>

<p>This unusual behavior matters because it challenges existing understandings of comet dynamics. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are closely monitoring the comet with spacecraft-based instruments, as astronomers prepare for its re-emergence in early December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in summer 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet is expected to pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Juice spacecraft observed the comet on November 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>Monitoring will continue on November 25, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in summer 2025. It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. Observations by ESA’s Juice spacecraft took place on November 2, and further monitoring is scheduled for November 25. The comet is anticipated to be closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The non-gravitational acceleration might be the technological signature of an internal engine,” said Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “@NASA's observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” stated NASA’s Acting Administrator Sean Duffy on X.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “For a natural comet, this blue color is very surprising,” Loeb noted, referencing research on the comet's unusual coloration.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet to enter the solar system. Previous interstellar comets have prompted discussions about their origins and composition. The unusual acceleration of 3I/ATLAS has sparked debate among scientists regarding its nature, with some suggesting it could be artificial rather than purely natural.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it re-emerges in early December, allowing scientists to gather more data and determine whether the comet is a natural object or has artificial characteristics.</p>
