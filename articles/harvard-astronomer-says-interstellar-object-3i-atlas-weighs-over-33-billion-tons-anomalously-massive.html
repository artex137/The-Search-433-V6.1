      <h2>Harvard Astronomer says interstellar object 3I/ATLAS weighs over 33 billion tons: 'Anomalously massive'</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomers have reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS weighs more than <strong>33 billion tons</strong>, marking it as an "anomalously massive" object in the solar system. The findings were published in a new paper by Avi Loeb, Richard Cloete, and Peter Veres, who have studied the comet's motion and characteristics over several months.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS is larger than previous interstellar objects, prompting questions about the frequency and characteristics of such celestial bodies. Astronomers are currently using data from various telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, to analyze the comet’s features and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Weight: Over <strong>33 billion tons</strong></li>
    <li>Diameter: Minimum of <strong>3 miles (5 kilometers)</strong></li>
    <li>Observations: <strong>4,022</strong> observations recorded over several months</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration: Less than <strong>49 feet (15 meters)</strong> per day squared</li>
    <li>Next observation opportunity: October 3, 2025, using the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, astronomers first spotted the comet 3I/ATLAS moving through the solar system. Over the following months, various telescopes collected data on the comet's motion and characteristics. The latest findings were shared by Harvard scientists through a post on Medium, revealing the comet's mass and its implications.</p>

<p>The analysis indicated that the comet's mass is greater than that of previous interstellar objects, 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Researchers have speculated on the reasons for the rarity of such massive interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“An alternative technological origin could explain the rare alignment of the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS with the ecliptic plane, and the detection of nickel without iron, as found in industrially-manufactured alloys,” stated Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things,” said Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for solar system small bodies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior research has identified two other interstellar objects, 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, but 3I/ATLAS’s mass and size present new questions about the population of such celestial bodies. The findings suggest that astronomers should have detected many more objects of similar characteristics given their size and mass.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers plan to continue observing 3I/ATLAS using advanced telescopes and instruments. They hope to gather more data that could provide insights into the comet's origins, journey, and composition.</p>
