      <h2>They’re Here!: Ottawa Science Chief Says Aliens Could Already Be Here, Urges Creation of National UFO Office</h2>

<p>Canada's chief science advisor, Dr. Mona Nemer, has stated that extraterrestrial probes may have already visited Earth. She made this assertion while advocating for the establishment of a federal office to manage UFO reports from the public. The comments were made in a report obtained through Access To Information, and no injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this topic.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights potential gaps in Canada's scientific approach to unidentified aerial phenomena. Nemer's report indicates that Canada lacks ongoing scientific research into UFOs, following the closure of the National Research Council's program in 1995. She has called for a centralized bureau to handle investigations and coordinate research, emphasizing the need for transparency and public engagement.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dr. Mona Nemer is the cabinet-appointed chief science advisor, earning $393,000 annually.</li>
    <li>The Sky Canada Project has assigned seven staff members, though total costs were not disclosed.</li>
    <li>The last federal agency to study UFOs was the National Research Council, which ended its program in 1995.</li>
    <li>No ongoing scientific research into unidentified aerial phenomena exists in Canada.</li>
    <li>The report notes a culture of ridicule surrounding UFO sightings, which discourages reporting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Dr. Mona Nemer has issued her report on UFOs as part of her Sky Canada Project. The report explores the possibility of extraterrestrial activity linked to unidentified aerial phenomena seen in Canada. Following the closure of the National Research Council's UFO program in 1995, no significant scientific efforts have been made to study UFOs.</p>

<p>In her internal memos, Nemer has recommended the creation of a centralized federal bureau to manage UFO reports and investigations. Despite these recommendations, Parliament has not yet addressed the issue.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Is it possible we are being visited by extraterrestrial vessels, inhabited or not?” the report asks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Openness and transparency are essential if Canada wants to take unidentified aerial phenomena seriously,” Nemer stated in her report.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The report indicates that while American interest in UFO sightings is prevalent, Canadian media coverage of the subject is limited. This disparity makes it challenging to assess public interest in UFOs in Canada.</p>

<p>Additionally, the report highlights a persistent stigma that surrounds UFO sightings, particularly among pilots and air traffic controllers, who often refrain from reporting incidents due to concerns about their reputations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Dr. Nemer's recommendation for a national UFO reporting office remains unaddressed by the Canadian government. Investigations into the feasibility of establishing such an office may be forthcoming as the conversation around unidentified aerial phenomena continues to evolve.</p>
