      <h2>Four Telescopes Confirm There's Something Deeply Strange About the Mysterious Object Headed Into the Solar System</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which was first spotted in early July as it approached the Sun. This object is only the third of its kind detected from beyond the solar system in human history, and researchers are intrigued by its unique characteristics. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the object.</p>

<p>The observations are significant as they provide new insights into the nature of interstellar objects. NASA's Hubble, SPHEREx, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and James Webb Space Telescope have all contributed to the study of 3I/ATLAS. Experts have reached a consensus that the object is a comet, but its unusual features have raised questions about its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is only the third interstellar object detected in history.</li>
    <li>The object has shown a high carbon dioxide to water ratio, the highest ever observed in a comet.</li>
    <li>TESS observed the object six astronomical units from the Sun, indicating activity at a distance beyond most comets.</li>
    <li>The object will make close flybys of Jupiter, Mars, and Venus.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Juno probe are set to observe the object as it approaches Mars and Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July 2023, scientists first detected 3I/ATLAS as it approached the Sun. Subsequent observations by TESS revealed that the object was already bright and active while six astronomical units from the Sun. Researchers have since used Hubble, SPHEREx, and James Webb telescopes to study the object's unique characteristics and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object does not feature a distinct cometary tail,” said Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, describing the teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust observed by Hubble.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It may contain ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets,” according to a preprint paper from an international team of researchers.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects have been detected, making this observation significant for the study of celestial bodies. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS challenge existing theories about the formation and behavior of comets from beyond the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further analysis of the observations made by the telescopes. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will look at the object as it comes within less than two million miles of Mars, while Juno is expected to intercept it as it approaches Jupiter.</p>
