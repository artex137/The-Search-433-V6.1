      <h2>Nine 'Mysterious' 3I/ATLAS Signals Identified As Human Noise</h2>

<p>Researchers have confirmed that nine radio signals detected from comet 3I/ATLAS, which passed through our Solar System, are human-made noise. The signals were flagged during a focused search by the Breakthrough Listen initiative on 18 December 2025 at the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it reinforces the understanding that many signals detected in deep-space observations can originate from terrestrial sources. The researchers concluded that no credible technosignatures have been found, leaving the potential for extraterrestrial communication unproven.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It passed no closer than 270 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
    <li>The signals were detected during a focused search on 18 December 2025.</li>
    <li>The Green Bank Telescope was used to sweep frequencies from 1 to 12 gigahertz.</li>
    <li>The nine signals were identified as human-made noise, likely from satellites and aircraft.</li>
    <li>The research paper summarising the findings is awaiting peer review.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawaii. The object was confirmed to be unbound to the Sun, indicating its interstellar origin.</p>

<p>On 18 December 2025, less than 24 hours before its closest approach to Earth, the Breakthrough Listen initiative conducted a detailed search for technosignatures using the Green Bank Telescope. The team identified nine radio events that appeared promising but were later determined to be interference from human technology.</p>

<p>Subsequent analysis revealed that the signals coincided with times when the telescope was not focused on 3I/ATLAS, leading researchers to conclude that they were not of extraterrestrial origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Like those searches, we find no credible detections of narrowband radio technosignatures originating from 3I/ATLAS,” the researchers stated in their paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>They also noted, “There is currently no evidence to suggest that ISOs are anything other than natural astrophysical objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS has sparked discussions about the possibility of interstellar objects being technological probes. Previous searches for technosignatures have similarly yielded no definitive evidence of extraterrestrial communications.</p>

<p>With only three known interstellar objects to date, the data remains limited, and researchers continue to emphasize the importance of careful measurement and analysis over sensational claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away from Earth, researchers will continue to refine their techniques for future interstellar observations. Continued support for initiatives like Breakthrough Listen is essential for enhancing the search for potential signals from extraterrestrial civilizations.</p>
