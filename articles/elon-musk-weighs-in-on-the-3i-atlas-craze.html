      <h2>Elon Musk Weighs In On the 3I/Atlas Craze</h2>

<p>Elon Musk has discussed the interstellar object 3I/Atlas during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, where he shared his views on its potential threat to Earth. The podcast was released on [insert date].</p>

<p>Musk's comments have generated significant interest due to the unusual characteristics of 3I/Atlas, which scientists have noted as it approaches the inner solar system. Authorities and scientists are closely monitoring the object as it travels near Jupiter, Venus, and Mars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas is described as being the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Elon Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast to discuss the object.</li>
    <li>Musk speculated that 3I/Atlas could be an "alien spaceship" due to its unusual trajectory.</li>
    <li>The object is approaching the inner solar system, with its path raising concerns among scientists.</li>
    <li>Musk stated that the presence of nickel on 3I/Atlas does not rule out it being a natural comet.</li>
    <li>He warned that a nickel-rich object could "obliterate a continent" if it were to strike Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On [insert date], Elon Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, discussing the interstellar object 3I/Atlas. He expressed his belief that the object could be more than just a comet, suggesting it might be an alien spacecraft. Musk highlighted the nickel composition of 3I/Atlas and its potential implications for Earth if it were to collide with the planet.</p>

<p>Following Musk's statements, scientists have continued to study the trajectory and composition of 3I/Atlas to assess any potential risks it may pose.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“One thing I can say is, if I was aware of any evidence of aliens, Joe you have my word that I will come on your show and reveal it,” Musk stated. “I keep my promises.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It would be a very heavy spaceship if you made it all out of nickel,” Musk added. “It would like, obliterate a continent type of thing. Maybe worse.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around 3I/Atlas comes amid growing interest in asteroids and comets that pass close to Earth. Historically, significant impacts have led to major extinction events, as Musk referenced during the podcast. The scientific community remains vigilant in monitoring such objects to prevent potential disasters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to track 3I/Atlas as it approaches the inner solar system. No immediate threats have been confirmed, but researchers are preparing to analyze its trajectory and composition more closely in the coming months.</p>
