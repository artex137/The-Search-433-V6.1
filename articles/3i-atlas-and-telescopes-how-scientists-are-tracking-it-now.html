      <h2>3I/ATLAS and Telescopes: How Scientists are Tracking it Now</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar comet discovered by NASA’s ATLAS telescope, is currently passing through our solar system for the first and only time. The comet was first identified on July 1, 2025, in Chile and is being tracked by global telescopes and real-time data systems.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third object ever observed entering our solar system from beyond the Sun. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are actively monitoring its trajectory and characteristics, revealing new discoveries weekly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> Approximately 130 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 1.8 times farther than Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Coma width:</strong> Thousands of kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Telescopes involved:</strong> ATLAS, Hubble, Webb, ESA Mars orbiters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope network in Chile. Following its discovery, scientists utilized various data sources, including past observations and space-based telescopes, to analyze its path and characteristics. The comet is expected to be closest to Mars and the Sun in October 2025, at a distance of about 130 million miles from the Sun.</p>

<p>As the comet travels through the solar system, telescopes around the world are capturing its long coma and tracking its activity. NASA’s spacecraft are also positioned to gather more data as the comet approaches.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As soon as the first images of 3I/ATLAS appeared, experts used past data, space-based telescopes, and Mars probes to gather details,” a NASA representative said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These results help us understand both the comet and the distant place it came from,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. The study of such comets provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies and the conditions of their origin.</p>

<p>The ATLAS telescope network, funded by NASA, operates in multiple locations, including Hawaii and South Africa, to monitor the night sky for moving objects. This network has been crucial in identifying and tracking such rare events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming months, scientists expect to obtain more detailed images and possibly conduct the first close-up studies of 3I/ATLAS. The ongoing observations will continue to shape our understanding of the universe and our cosmic neighbourhood.</p>
