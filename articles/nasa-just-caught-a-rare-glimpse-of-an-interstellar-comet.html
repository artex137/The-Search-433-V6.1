      <h2>Nasa's Europa Clipper Captures Data on Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft has captured significant data on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its observations in November 2025. The comet, which became the third officially confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system in July 2025, was observed using the Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) led by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI).</p>

<p>This observation is crucial as it provides a unique perspective on the comet during a time when viewing from Earth and Mars was difficult. The data collected may enhance understanding of the comet's composition and its journey through the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS entered the solar system in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper launched in 2024 and is expected to reach Jupiter in 2030.</li>
    <li>Observations took place in November 2025.</li>
    <li>UVS identified oxygen, hydrogen, and dust signatures from the comet.</li>
    <li>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) mapped the comet's path shortly after its discovery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was confirmed as an interstellar object entering the solar system. Less than a week later, NASA's JPL mapped its trajectory. By November 2025, the Europa Clipper spacecraft used its UVS to observe the comet, providing a unique view of its tails.</p>

<p>The UVS instrument captured data from a vantage point that allowed for a downstream view of the comet's dust and plasma tails. This observation coincided with data being collected by the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), which provided additional perspectives.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We're excited that this opportunity to view another target on the way to Jupiter was completely unexpected,” said Dr. Kurt Retherford, principal investigator for Europa-UVS at SwRI.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Understanding the composition of the comet and how readily these gases are emitted can give us a clearer view of the comet's origin and how it may have evolved during transit from elsewhere in the galaxy to our solar system,” said Dr. Tracy Becker, co-deputy principal investigator of Europa-UVS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov, have also provided insights into the composition and behavior of comets originating from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>The Europa Clipper mission aims to enhance our understanding of Jupiter's moons, particularly Europa, which may harbor conditions suitable for life. The data from 3I/ATLAS will contribute to broader research on cometary science and the origins of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Europa Clipper team will analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS further, along with observations from JUICE and terrestrial telescopes. The findings may provide insights into the comet's origins and chemical processes, enhancing our understanding of interstellar bodies.</p>
