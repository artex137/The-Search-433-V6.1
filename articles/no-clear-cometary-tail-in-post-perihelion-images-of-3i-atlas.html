      <h2>No Clear Cometary Tail in Post-Perihelion Images of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On November 5, 2025, new images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS were released, showing a compact source of light without a clear cometary tail. The images were captured following the object's perihelion passage, which occurred earlier in the year. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has reported non-gravitational acceleration associated with the comet, which raises questions about its behavior.</p>

<p>This matter is significant because the absence of a typical cometary tail contradicts expectations based on the object's mass loss during perihelion. Authorities, including researchers from Harvard University, are analyzing the implications of these findings as they seek to understand the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of new images: November 5, 2025</li>
    <li>Previous image date: July 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Mass loss during perihelion: larger than 13%</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration: 1.1x10<sup>-6</sup> au/day<sup>2</sup> radial; 3.7x10<sup>-7</sup> au/day<sup>2</sup> transverse</li>
    <li>Likelihood of retrograde trajectory alignment: 0.2%</li>
    <li>Likelihood of gas plume composition anomalies: below 1%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has undergone several notable events since its discovery:</p>
<ul>
    <li>July 21, 2025: Initial observations of 3I/ATLAS are made using the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>August 2025: The object displays a sunward jet, referred to as an anti-tail.</li>
    <li>November 5, 2025: New images reveal a lack of a typical cometary tail post-perihelion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The absence of a clear cometary tail in the latest images raises important questions about the behavior and composition of 3I/ATLAS,” said Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique among known comets, exhibiting characteristics that differ significantly from typical cometary behavior. Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have shown more conventional cometary traits. The anomalies observed in 3I/ATLAS continue to challenge current astronomical understanding.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from 3I/ATLAS to determine the implications of its unusual characteristics. Further studies may refine our understanding of interstellar objects and their behaviors.</p>
