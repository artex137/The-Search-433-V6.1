      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could be alien technology zooming through solar system, NASA ponders</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has captivated the public as it travels through our solar system at approximately 209,000 km/h. First observed in July 2025 from Chile, the comet is one of only three known interstellar objects to visit Earth's vicinity, and scientists are racing to gather data before it moves behind the sun.</p>

<p>This comet's significance lies in its size and characteristics, which have led some researchers to speculate about its origins. NASA has been monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely, while Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested it could be an artifact of alien technology due to its mass and dimensions. However, NASA has dismissed this theory, asserting that the object poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first seen in July 2025 from Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at 130,000 mph (209,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>It weighs over 33 billion tons and spans at least 3.1 miles (5 km).</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object detected, after Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The object will not come closer than approximately 170 million miles to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS from Chile. Since then, scientists have monitored its trajectory as it moves through the solar system. In recent weeks, new data has surfaced, prompting discussions about the comet's mass and potential origins. NASA has conducted extensive studies using both ground and space telescopes to analyze the comet's properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It’s a comet,” Statler added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar comets is a recent advancement in astronomy. Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two such objects had been identified, highlighting the rarity of these cosmic visitors. The study of these comets provides insights into the composition of other solar systems and the dynamics of interstellar travel.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it makes close passes with Mars, Jupiter, and Venus. Ongoing observations aim to gather more information about the comet's composition and behavior as it travels through the solar system.</p>
