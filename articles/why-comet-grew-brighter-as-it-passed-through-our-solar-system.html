      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Brightens After Passing the Sun</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has grown significantly brighter after its closest approach to the Sun, according to researchers. The comet, which is the third interstellar object discovered in our solar system, exhibited a dramatic increase in brightness two months after its flyby.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is important as it provides insight into the behavior of comets, particularly those from outside our solar system. NASA’s SPHEREx space telescope observed the comet in December 2025, capturing data that will enhance our understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to the Sun in October 2025.</li>
    <li>The significant brightening was noted two months later in December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is composed of about one-third bulk water ice.</li>
    <li>NASA's SPHEREx mission captured images of the comet during its December observations.</li>
    <li>Study lead Carey Lisse is from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</li>
    <li>Yoonsoo Bach is the deputy study lead from the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun. Following this event, researchers observed a notable increase in brightness two months later, in December 2025. During this period, data collected by NASA’s SPHEREx mission provided insights into the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<p>As the comet vented water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide, it released carbon-rich material that had been locked in ice. This activity contributed to the brightening effect noted by scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, after its close flyby of the Sun, causing it to significantly brighten,” said Carey Lisse, lead of the study from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are now seeing the usual range of early solar system materials, including organic molecules, soot, and rock dust, that are typically emitted by a comet,” Lisse added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Our unique space telescope is gathering unprecedented data from across the universe,” said Yoonsoo Bach, deputy study lead from the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute. “But in this case, our galaxy delivered a piece of a faraway star system to us only a few months after launch, and SPHEREx was ready to observe it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked interest since its discovery, with some theories suggesting it could be an artificial probe. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has posited that its unusual trajectory and brightness could indicate a non-natural origin. This speculation has led to discussions about the potential implications for humanity.</p>

<p>Prior to this, the comet's behavior aligns with typical cometary activity, where comets brighten as they approach the Sun and vent gases.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected by SPHEREx to further understand the composition and behavior of Comet 3I/ATLAS. Ongoing observations may yield additional insights into interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>
