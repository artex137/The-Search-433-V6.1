      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Baffles Scientists With Wobbling Jets</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual behavior, including a sun-facing anti-tail and rhythmic jet-like outflows, during its passage through the solar system in December 2025. Scientists have recorded these phenomena over 37 nights of observation, leading to new insights into the comet's structure and behavior.</p>

<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS are significant because they challenge existing models of planetary defense. The comet's unpredictable changes in spin, momentum, and outgassing patterns suggest that small celestial bodies can behave in complex ways, complicating our understanding of their trajectories and potential threats to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Observation period:</strong> July to September 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Rotation period:</strong> 15 hours and 30 minutes</li>
    <li><strong>Anti-tail length:</strong> Up to 1 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Number of observation nights:</strong> 37</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in June 2025 as it entered the solar system. Over the following months, astronomers observed its behavior, noting the unexpected formation of a sun-facing anti-tail. Detailed tracking at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife revealed the comet's jets shifted every seven hours and forty-five minutes, indicating a rapid rotation. The comet reached its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, before continuing its journey into space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object changed in ways our models did not predict,” wrote an observer for the USA Herald.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Planetary defense models depend on predictability. They assume that once an orbit is solved, it remains stable absent external forces,” the USA Herald reported.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Apophis poses no impact threat in 2029 based on current observations,” stated the NASA Planetary Defense Coordination Office.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Previous objects passed with little more than a trace, but 3I/ATLAS has provided a unique opportunity to study the behavior of interstellar bodies in detail. The comet's unpredictability raises questions about long-term models used in planetary defense strategies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As researchers analyze the data from 3I/ATLAS, they aim to improve their understanding of interstellar comets and refine models for future cosmic encounters. The upcoming flyby of asteroid 99942 Apophis on April 13, 2029, will serve as a critical test of these models, as agencies like NASA and the European Space Agency prepare for the event.</p>
