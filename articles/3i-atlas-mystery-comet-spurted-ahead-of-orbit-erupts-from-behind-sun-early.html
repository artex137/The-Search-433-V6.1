      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery: Comet 'Spurted Ahead' of Orbit, Erupts From Behind Sun Early</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar visitor to enter our Solar System, has erupted from behind the Sun earlier than expected, releasing a massive jet of gas and dust. The outburst occurred just days before its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025.</p>

<p>This eruption has drawn significant attention from astronomers who believe it may provide new insights into chemical processes occurring beyond our Solar System. The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has confirmed the jet's expansion, highlighting the comet's unusual activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> 29 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Outburst Location:</strong> Behind the Sun, observed from Tenerife and Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Plume Size:</strong> 10,000 km</li>
    <li><strong>Dust Emission Rate:</strong> Increased as it nears the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide-to-Water Ratio:</strong> 8:1</li>
    <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> Not visible from Earth, expected to re-emerge in late November</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been tracked since its discovery, but its recent eruption has surprised astronomers. The comet emitted a substantial plume of gas and dust, likely triggered by solar heating of subsurface ices. The outburst was captured by telescopes in Tenerife and Hawaii, providing critical data just before its approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>As of now, ground-based observations are paused due to the Sun's glare. However, space-based instruments continue to monitor the comet's activity, with significant findings emerging from the Trace Gas Orbiter aboard the ExoMars mission.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is only the third interstellar comet we've ever studied. It's like looking directly at the chemical fingerprints of another star system,” said astrophysicist Jason Wright.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Christine Moreno of Madrid's Complutense University remarked, “Watching a traveller from a distant world suddenly unpack before arrival.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, which dimmed after discovery, 3I/ATLAS is brightening as it approaches perihelion, presenting a unique opportunity for study.</p>

<p>The comet's high carbon dioxide-to-water ratio indicates it formed in an ultra-cold region around another star, offering insights into the chemical dynamics of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves behind the Sun, astronomers are preparing for an observation campaign upon its return in late November. The comet's early eruption and volatile behavior may transform our understanding of cosmic chemistry and the formation of interstellar objects.</p>
