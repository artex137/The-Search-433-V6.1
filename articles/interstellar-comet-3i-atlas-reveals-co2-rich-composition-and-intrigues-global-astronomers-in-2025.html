      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals CO2-rich composition and intrigues global astronomers in 2025</h2>

<p>Astronomers from the International Astronomical Union have confirmed the interstellar origin of comet 3I/ATLAS on July 2, 2025. The comet, which was first detected by the ATLAS system in Chile, represents the third known visitor from outside the Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. It has not caused any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it drives coordinated observations by various space agencies. The comet’s hyperbolic trajectory indicates it will not return to the Solar System. The scientific community is analyzing its composition to gain insights into materials formed in another star system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, between the constellations of Serpent and Sagittarius.</li>
    <li>Comet diameter estimated between 20-30 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Perihelion approach to the Sun at 1.37 AU in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Core estimated at 320 meters to 5.6 kilometers, as per Hubble observations.</li>
    <li>Current speed recorded at 1.5 inches per minute, with observed acceleration.</li>
    <li>Visible at magnitude 11.7 on November 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>Maximum proximity to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 268 million kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The NASA-funded ATLAS system initially identified 3I/ATLAS as a weak point in observations from June 2025. The object was confirmed on July 2, 2025, by the Nordic Optical Telescope, which noted its active cometary characteristics, including a marginal coma and tail elongation.</p>
<p>Subsequent research conducted in Chile and Arizona validated its interstellar nature. The James Webb Space Telescope observed the comet in August 2025, revealing a coma dominated by carbon dioxide in an 8:1 ratio with water.</p>
<p>During October 1-7, 2025, the European Space Agency recorded 3I/ATLAS using ExoMars TGO and Mars Express, confirming stable activity without outbreaks until September.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Astronomers are excited about the potential insights this comet can provide into the formation of planetary systems outside our own, especially with its unique chemical composition.</blockquote> 

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third extrasolar comet discovered, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its chemical anomalies challenge existing models of cometary formation, suggesting a rich diversity in planetary systems beyond the Solar System. The ongoing analysis focuses on volatiles and dust, crucial for understanding formative processes in distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing studies will continue to analyze the ionic tail of 3I/ATLAS. The Clipper mission is expected to cross Europe between October 30 and November 6, 2025, although official confirmation of maneuvers is pending. Observations during its post-perihelion phase in mid-November will provide further insights into the comet's behavior as it escapes solar glare.</p>
