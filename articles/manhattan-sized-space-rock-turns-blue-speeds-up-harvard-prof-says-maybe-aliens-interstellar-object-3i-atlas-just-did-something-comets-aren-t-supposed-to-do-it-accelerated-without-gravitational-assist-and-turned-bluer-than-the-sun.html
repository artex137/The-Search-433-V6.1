      <h2>Manhattan-sized space rock turns blue, speeds up</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual behaviour as it accelerates without gravitational assist while passing the Sun. NASA recorded this non-gravitational acceleration this week, and the object has changed colour from red to green and now to blue.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has drawn attention from scientists, particularly Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who has suggested it could indicate a technological signature of an internal propulsion system. The object is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, at a distance of 267 million kilometres.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 267 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Current observed colour: Blue</li>
    <li>Previous colours: Red, then green</li>
    <li>Recorded by: NASA and US Naval Research Lab</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has displayed a series of unusual changes in its behaviour:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The object was first identified as red, then shifted to green, and most recently to blue.</li>
    <li>NAVAR has observed non-gravitational acceleration, which is atypical for comets.</li>
    <li>The object made a flyby of Mars in October 2023, where close-up images were captured.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist, stated, "If we do not observe a massive cloud of gas around 3I/ATLAS in December, it could indicate a propulsion system."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time an interstellar object has raised eyebrows. Previous observations have led to speculation regarding their nature and origins. The unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has prompted discussions about whether it could be a comet or something more technologically advanced.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will closely monitor 3I/ATLAS during its approach in December for signs of a comet tail or other features that could clarify its nature. The upcoming observations will be crucial in determining whether it is a natural object or something engineered.</p>
