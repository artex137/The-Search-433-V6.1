      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: What Did ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter Capture at Close Range Before Comet Disappeared Behind the Sun?</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 P1 (ATLAS), has passed its perihelion, becoming unobservable from Earth as it hides behind the Sun. This phase, known as solar conjunction, has prompted several spacecraft near Mars to track the comet, with the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) capturing valuable data on the object earlier this month.</p>

<p>This data is significant as it provides scientists a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object within the Solar System. The findings from the TGO could offer insights into the composition and activity of 3I/ATLAS, which may differ from typical comets originating from the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 1.35 to 1.40 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, or just over 200 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The comet has become unobservable from Earth due to solar conjunction.</li>
    <li>ExoMars TGO collected high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic data earlier this month.</li>
    <li>The NASA Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected hydroxyl gas (OH) in the comet's coma.</li>
    <li>The next viewing opportunity for 3I/ATLAS will open in mid-November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, and became unobservable from Earth due to solar conjunction. During this time, the ExoMars TGO was positioned to observe the comet and collected detailed imaging and spectroscopic data. The observations provided insights into the comet's physical composition and volatile activity.</p>
<p>In addition, the NASA Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected hydroxyl gas in the comet's coma, indicating the release of water vapour. Reports emerged about unusual ratios of carbon dioxide to water, suggesting 3I/ATLAS may have formed in a colder environment.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations are among the most detailed ever obtained for an interstellar object, providing new insights into its physical composition and volatile activity,” according to ESA's preliminary mission reports.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this, other interstellar objects have been observed, but 3I/ATLAS presents unique characteristics that intrigue scientists. The unusual ratios of gases detected may indicate a formation process different from that of typical comets, prompting further investigation into its origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The next observation window for 3I/ATLAS is expected in mid-November 2025, when the comet will re-emerge from behind the Sun. Several observatories, including NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope, will participate in coordinated tracking campaigns to gather more data.</p>
