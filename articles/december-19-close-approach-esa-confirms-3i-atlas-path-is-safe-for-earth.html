      <h2>December 19 Close Approach: ESA Confirms 3I/ATLAS Path Is Safe For Earth</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that the comet 3I/ATLAS will safely pass Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometres, which poses no danger to the planet. The comet, which has been tracked since its initial sighting on July 1, 2025, is the third confirmed interstellar object to be observed in our Solar System.</p>

<p>This close encounter is significant for planetary defence efforts. Knowing the precise trajectory of 3I/ATLAS allows scientists to assess potential threats from celestial objects and refine their tracking methodologies. The ESA's successful tracking of this comet has offered valuable insights into the capabilities of monitoring interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>Initial sighting occurred on July 1, 2025, at Gemini South Observatory.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars was on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 29 million km (18 million mi).</li>
    <li>Scheduled to pass Earth on December 19, 2025, at 270 million km (170 million mi).</li>
    <li>Current speed of 3I/ATLAS is approximately 250,000 km/h (155,350 mph).</li>
    <li>Comet size estimated between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres across.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025, by astronomers at the Gemini South Observatory. Following its discovery, scientists began tracking its trajectory, which was confirmed to be hyperbolic, indicating it will escape the Solar System. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 30, 2025, where data from the ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) was utilized to enhance trajectory predictions. It is now set to pass Earth safely on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Knowing an object's precise trajectory is the only way to determine if a comet or asteroid poses a threat to Earth,” said an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected by ATLAS, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The successful tracking and prediction of 3I/ATLAS's path marks a significant advancement in the methods used for planetary defence, showcasing the importance of combining data from ground-based and space-based observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ESA will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS using the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission. The data collected will not be released until next year, but it is expected to yield important findings about the comet. Additionally, the ESA is preparing for two future missions: the Comet Interceptor, set to launch by 2029, and the Near-Earth Object Mission in the Infrared (NEOMIR), aimed at monitoring Earth’s blind spot for incoming comets.</p>
