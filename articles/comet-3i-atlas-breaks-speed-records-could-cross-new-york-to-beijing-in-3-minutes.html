      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Breaks Speed Records: Could Cross New York To Beijing In 3 Minutes</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System), is currently moving through the solar system at a speed of 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 kilometers per hour). This speed is enough to travel from New York City to Beijing in just three minutes. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to the comet's approach.</p>

<p>The record-breaking speed of 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers and space enthusiasts worldwide. NASA officials have noted that the comet has likely been drifting through interstellar space for billions of years, contributing to its extreme velocity. As it approaches the Sun, scientists anticipate a rare opportunity to study this interstellar visitor and its unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
  <li>Speed: 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 kilometers per hour).</li>
  <li>Expected closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2025.</li>
  <li>Closest point to the Sun: approximately 1.4 astronomical units (around 210 million kilometers or 130 million miles).</li>
  <li>Notable observations during the September 7, 2025 total lunar eclipse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, NASA's ATLAS discovered Comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, the comet has been observed for its record-breaking speed and changes in its physical characteristics. On September 7, 2025, astrophotographers captured images of the comet during a total lunar eclipse, revealing potential changes in color and brightness.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest approach to the Sun, providing scientists with a unique opportunity to study its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet offers a glimpse into the mysteries of the universe beyond our solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Its speed and transformation as it nears the Sun fuel further curiosity among astronomers.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the latest in a series of interstellar objects that have entered our solar system, challenging existing theories about the origins and compositions of such celestial bodies. Observations of 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the conditions of the early solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will monitor its approach to the Sun and gather data to better understand its composition and behavior. Further observations are planned, particularly as it nears its closest point to the Sun in October 2025.</p>
