      <h2>3I/ATLAS Sets Date with Eupheme, an Irregular Moon Orbiting Jupiter</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS is on a trajectory towards Jupiter, set to come within 53.61 million kilometres of the planet on March 16, 2026, before making a close approach to its irregular moon Eupheme a day later.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it could provide insights into the gravitational dynamics of Jupiter and its moons. Authorities and astronomers are closely monitoring the comet's path, as any fragments released by 3I/ATLAS could potentially become new moons for Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be within 53.61 million kilometres of Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>Jupiter's Hill radius spans 53.5 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will fly within 30.46 million kilometres of Eupheme on March 17, 2026.</li>
    <li>Eupheme is classified as an irregular moon and is part of the Ananke group of Jovian satellites.</li>
    <li>Jupiter currently has 95 known moons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has completed flybys near Mars, the Sun, and Earth as part of its journey through the solar system. It is now approaching Jupiter, where it will encounter the planet's gravitational influence.</p>
<p>On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Jupiter. The following day, it will pass near Eupheme, an irregular moon discovered in 2003.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, stated, "If scientists spot a fresh 96th moon around Jupiter after March 16, 2026, it would be a clear technological signature for 3I/ATLAS."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also commented on the feasibility of 3I/ATLAS releasing fragments, saying, "A kick of the required magnitude and direction to bring a fragment of 3I/ATLAS into a bound orbit around Jupiter is an impossible outcome from the break-up of a comet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Eupheme is part of the Ananke group, which consists of 15 Jovian satellites thought to have originated from a larger body that broke apart. These moons exhibit irregular orbits, contrasting with the more uniform paths of Jupiter's larger moons.</p>
<p>The interaction between 3I/ATLAS and Jupiter could contribute to ongoing research into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies in the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. They will analyze data to determine if any fragments are released during the encounter, which could provide further insights into the dynamics of the gas giant and its moons.</p>
