      <h2>Reawakened Comet 3I/ATLAS Near Earth: Two Tails and a Strange “Heartbeat” Make It Brighter</h2>

<p>Skywatchers are observing a rare celestial event as Comet 3I/ATLAS makes its return through the inner solar system, currently located approximately 40 million kilometers from Earth. The comet, first discovered in early 2020, has reawakened with two distinct tails and a unique pulsing brightness that astronomers are actively studying.</p>

<p>This unusual behavior of Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant for the scientific community, as it may provide insights into cometary behavior and interstellar materials. Researchers worldwide are using telescopes to capture data on the comet's dual tails and its intermittent brightening events, which could reshape our understanding of how comets function as they approach the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently about 40 million kilometers from Earth, or 0.3 astronomical units (AU).</li>
    <li>It was first discovered in early 2020 and has reemerged in 2024.</li>
    <li>The comet features two distinct tails: one of ionized gases and another of dust particles.</li>
    <li>It exhibits a "heartbeat" pulse of brightening every few hours.</li>
    <li>Researchers from various observatories are monitoring its behavior.</li>
    <li>The comet poses no threat of impact with Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in early 2020 but faded from view shortly after. In 2024, it has reappeared, displaying unexpected brightness and two distinct tails. Researchers are now analyzing its behavior, which includes a pulsing brightness and chaotic tail formations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is one of the most behaviorally unique comets we’ve tracked in recent decades,” said Dr. Helen Vargas, senior astronomer at a leading observatory. “It’s not fracturing in ways we expect, and the alternating pulses could suggest internal pressure changes or unusual magnetic interactions with solar winds.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The double tail structure is intense and dynamic—an outstanding example of how comets evolve in real-time,” said Prof. Amina Chaudhary, Astrophysics Department Chair.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We may be capturing never-before-seen signs of how materials behave after eons of deep space travel,” said Dr. Tomaso Rizzi, Lead Comet Researcher.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its potential interstellar origins, which could place it alongside other significant interstellar objects like ‘Oumuamua. Its recent behavior contrasts sharply with its initial discovery, where it quickly disintegrated and became nearly invisible.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to continue monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS for further insights into its behavior and composition. There are discussions about potentially redirecting existing space probes for a flyby if its trajectory remains accessible and predictable over the coming weeks.</p>
