      <h2>Drones buzzing airports are not Putin's – but alien-controlled UFOs says Uri Geller</h2>

<p>Danish authorities have closed airspace at Aalborg Airport after multiple drones were spotted in the area on Wednesday night. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the incident.</p>

<p>Uri Geller, a spoon-bending mystic, has claimed that the drones are not human-controlled but rather alien-controlled UFOs. He has urged governments to "stop gaslighting the public" and to acknowledge the existence of these unidentified flying objects. Geller predicts more sightings will occur in the coming months across various locations worldwide, including airports and military bases.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Aalborg Airport, Denmark</li>
    <li>Incident date: Wednesday night (exact time not disclosed)</li>
    <li>Police response: Nordjyllands Police are investigating</li>
    <li>Related incidents: Drones also spotted near airports in Esbjerg, Sonderborg, and Skrydstrup</li>
    <li>Norway's Oslo Airport airspace closed for three hours due to drone sighting</li>
    <li>Previous incidents: Gatwick Airport closed for 30 hours in 2018 due to drone sightings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Wednesday night, multiple drones were observed near Aalborg Airport, leading to the closure of airspace and halting military and commercial flights. The police confirmed the presence of the drones but did not disclose the identity of the operators.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, drones were also reported near Copenhagen Airport, raising security concerns among authorities. In response, the Danish Armed Forces have heightened their vigilance, especially since Aalborg Airport hosts military operations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Drones have been observed near Aalborg Airport and the airspace is closed. The police are present and investigating further,” said Nordjyllands Police on X.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Of course many of these reports do not cover activities that are of interest to the police or the military, but some of them do, and I think the one in Aalborg does,” stated Denmark's national police commissioner Thorkild Fogde.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Drone sightings have previously caused significant disruptions at airports. In 2018, Gatwick Airport had to shut down for 30 hours due to over 100 drone sightings. This incident prompted the UK government to extend no-fly zones around airports to three miles. In 2023, another runway at Gatwick was closed for an hour due to a drone sighting, and Frankfurt Airport also halted air traffic for two days due to similar incursions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to investigate the recent drone sightings. Security officials are on high alert for potential further incidents, particularly given the speculation regarding possible foreign involvement.</p>
