      <h2>What is a Black Swan event and how 3I/ATLAS could cause one?</h2>

<p>On a recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb discussed Comet 3I ATLAS and its potential implications for humanity. Loeb stated that 3I ATLAS does not fit into any known category of comet or asteroid. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this topic.</p>

<p>This discussion is significant because it raises questions about the scientific community's approach to rare cosmic events. Loeb argues that the discovery of an alien artefact could represent a “Black Swan” event, which has the potential to alter civilization if confirmed. He has urged space agencies such as NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) to allocate more resources to studying 3I ATLAS directly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a Harvard astronomer.</li>
    <li>3I ATLAS is travelling on a retrograde path through the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet's composition is nickel-heavy.</li>
    <li>Loeb describes the scientific community as risk-averse.</li>
    <li>Loeb suggests there is a 1% chance that 3I ATLAS is artificial.</li>
    <li>Loeb has called for increased funding for the study of 3I ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience where he discussed the characteristics of 3I ATLAS, highlighting its unusual trajectory and composition. He pointed out that the comet's retrograde path and nickel-heavy makeup contradict established scientific models.</p>

<p>Loeb emphasized the importance of investigating outliers in scientific research, arguing that ignoring them could lead to missing transformative discoveries. He urged agencies like NASA and ESA to invest resources in exploring 3I ATLAS, suggesting that even a slight chance of it being artificial warrants serious investigation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If you keep ignoring outliers, you miss the very things that redefine reality,” said Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The cost of being wrong is embarrassment. But the cost of being right and doing nothing could be missing the most important discovery in human history,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We invest billions in preventing rare disasters on Earth. Why not invest a fraction of that in exploring a cosmic anomaly that might prove we’re not alone?” Loeb urged.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The term “Black Swan”, popularised by statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb, refers to highly improbable events with significant consequences. Previous examples include financial crashes and global pandemics. Loeb's assertion that 3I ATLAS could represent a similar event highlights a growing concern within the scientific community regarding the exploration of rare phenomena.</p>

<p>Loeb criticized the scientific focus on “safe” research, particularly in the search for microbial life, suggesting that this approach limits the potential for groundbreaking discoveries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb's call for action may prompt further discussions within NASA and ESA about the allocation of resources to study 3I ATLAS. Future investigations could focus on identifying any artificial signatures emitted by the comet.</p>
