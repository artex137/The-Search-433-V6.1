      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Caught in UV What Europa Clipper Saw When No One Else Could</h2>

<p>NASA’s Europa Clipper spacecraft has captured unprecedented observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from a distance of approximately 164 million kilometers. The data was collected on November 6, 2023, while the comet was hidden from view behind the Sun and out of reach of other observatories.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object using a spacecraft originally designed to investigate Jupiter’s moon Europa. NASA has repurposed the Europa Clipper's ultraviolet spectrograph to gather compositional data from the comet, providing insights into the materials found in comets from other planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed on November 6, 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance from Europa Clipper to the comet was about 164 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Observation was made possible due to the spacecraft’s unique positioning and instrument sensitivity.</li>
    <li>Key atomic species detected included hydrogen and oxygen, indicating the presence of water ice.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper’s ultraviolet spectrograph was the primary tool for this observation.</li>
    <li>Data collection is ongoing, with analysis to refine estimates of dust composition and potential ion tail signatures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 6, 2023, Europa Clipper began observing 3I/ATLAS as the comet passed behind the Sun. The spacecraft utilized its ultraviolet spectrograph to capture data that ground-based observatories could not access during this period. The observations revealed stable cometary activity, including clear signs of water ice in the comet's coma.</p>

<p>Following these observations, scientists from NASA and other space agencies have begun analyzing the data to better understand the comet's structure and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This observation provides some of the first direct compositional confirmation that comets formed in other planetary systems can contain the same fundamental volatile materials as those in our own,” said Dr. Cynthia Phillips, Europa Clipper Project Staff Scientist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The coordinated but largely opportunistic effort reflects a growing capability: a distributed network of spacecraft acting as mobile observatories,” Dr. Phillips added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, the scientific community was uncertain whether 3I/ATLAS would exhibit familiar outgassing behavior typical of comets formed in the solar system. The successful observation by Europa Clipper enhances understanding of how interstellar comets can behave similarly to those formed closer to the Sun.</p>

<p>This incident is part of a broader trend in planetary science, where spacecraft designed for specific missions are increasingly being repurposed to study transient astronomical events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing analysis of the data from Europa Clipper is expected to refine scientists' understanding of the comet's dust composition and the potential presence of an ion tail. Further data from other missions, including ESA’s JUICE spacecraft, will help provide additional context to the findings.</p>
