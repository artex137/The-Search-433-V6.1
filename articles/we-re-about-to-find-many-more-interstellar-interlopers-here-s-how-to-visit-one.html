      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Mars, Capturing Scientific Interest</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to Mars on Friday, as international spacecraft turned their cameras toward the object. The comet, which originated from interstellar space, is set to reach perihelion—the closest point to the Sun—by the end of October 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third interstellar object detected within our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Scientists believe interstellar objects frequently transit through the Solar System, but advancements in telescope technology have only recently allowed for their detection. Observations of 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into cosmic history, with the potential for future missions to explore such objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Mars on October 20, 2023.</li>
    <li>It will reach perihelion at the end of October 2023.</li>
    <li>The nearest approach to Earth will be approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) in December 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA's Perseverance rover and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter participated in observations.</li>
    <li>Observations have shown a coma around the comet containing water vapor and carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between the size of the Empire State Building and larger than Central Park.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers first reported observations of 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2023. The comet was detected as it entered the Solar System, having roamed the galaxy for billions of years. It made its closest approach to Mars on October 20, 2023. The best views of the comet so far have been captured by the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency released grainy images of 3I/ATLAS on Tuesday following the observations from Mars. The images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, specifically from the HiRISE camera, will not be released until after the ongoing federal government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We had no role in that paper,” said Scott Bolton, lead scientist on the Juno mission, referring to the proposal to redirect the Juno spacecraft to 3I/ATLAS. “He assumed propellant that we don’t really have.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects like 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov have sparked interest in the scientific community, leading to discussions on the feasibility of missions to explore such objects. The challenges include the high speeds at which these objects travel and the short time frames for detection before their closest approaches. Current technology has limited the ability to plan missions to interstellar objects effectively.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are exploring ways to improve detection and mission planning for future interstellar objects. The ongoing interest in 3I/ATLAS may lead to further studies and potential missions to explore similar objects in the future.</p>
