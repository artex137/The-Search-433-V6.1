      <h2>3I/ATLAS 'Alien Mothership' Rumours: Harvard Scientist Says Comet Could Use Sun's Gravity to Target Earth</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Michio Kaku has stated that the comet 3I/ATLAS may use the Sun's gravity to alter its trajectory towards Earth. This announcement has sparked discussions about the potential implications of the comet's path. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this event.</p>

<p>This information is significant as it raises concerns about the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS, which was first identified in March 2023. Authorities, including astronomers and space agencies, are currently monitoring the comet's path to evaluate any potential risk to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified in March 2023.</li>
    <li>Michio Kaku is a prominent physicist at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>The comet’s trajectory may be influenced by the Sun's gravitational pull.</li>
    <li>No reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</li>
    <li>Observations are ongoing by astronomers and space agencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2023, 3I/ATLAS was first observed by astronomers. Since then, scientists have been monitoring its trajectory. Michio Kaku announced the potential for the comet to use the Sun's gravity to adjust its path towards Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet may use the Sun's gravity to target Earth,” said Michio Kaku, highlighting concerns about its trajectory.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in near-Earth objects and their potential impact on our planet. In recent years, space agencies have increased efforts to track such objects to mitigate any threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to assess its trajectory and any potential risks it may pose. Further updates will be provided as new information becomes available.</p>
