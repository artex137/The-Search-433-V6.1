      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-27 15:58 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS 'Alien Mothership' Rumours: Harvard Scientist Says Comet Could Use Sun's Gravity to Target Earth</h2>

<p>A Harvard scientist has claimed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may not be a simple icy rock, suggesting it could harness the Sun's gravity to target Earth. This speculation arises as the comet approaches its closest point to the Sun, scheduled for 29 October 2023, sparking discussions about its true nature and origin.</p>

<p>This assertion has led to widespread interest and concern, as authorities and researchers prepare to observe the comet's solar flyby. The event is expected to provide critical insights that may clarify whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural celestial body or something more extraordinary.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its perihelion on 29 October 2023.</li>
    <li>It is currently 210 million kilometres from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet has a 56,000-kilometre-long ion tail.</li>
    <li>NASA's Europa Clipper and the European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft will observe the comet from 25 October to 6 November.</li>
    <li>The ESA's JUICE spacecraft will also observe 3I/ATLAS from behind the Sun in November.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation since 1 July 2023. As it approaches the Sun, it is expected to undergo significant changes due to solar energy.</p>
<p>The comet will reach its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October, marking a pivotal moment that may alter its appearance and behaviour. Observations from various spacecraft will occur between 25 October and 6 November, coinciding with the comet's solar flyby.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If 3I/ATLAS is a piece of alien technology, it might utilise the time spent behind the Sun to swing towards Earth,” said Harvard scientist Avi Loeb during an interview with actor Mayim Bialik.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The mothership could deploy mini-probes which perform a reverse Oberth manoeuvre to slow down at perihelion and intercept Earth,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The speculation surrounding 3I/ATLAS follows a history of interest in interstellar objects. Previous incidents have included the observation of Oumuamua, which also sparked debates about the potential for alien technology in our solar system. Current policies regarding space observation aim to enhance our understanding of such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, researchers will closely monitor the comet's behaviour during its solar flyby. Data collected from the observing spacecraft will be crucial in determining the comet's true nature and may be released in the coming months.</p>
