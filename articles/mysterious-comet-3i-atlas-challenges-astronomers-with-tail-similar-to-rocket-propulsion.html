      <h2>Mysterious comet 3I/ATLAS challenges astronomers with tail similar to rocket propulsion</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has raised significant questions among astronomers following its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. This cosmic object is the third confirmed to originate from outside our Solar System and is currently moving away from Earth at high speed, with a trajectory set to cross Jupiter's orbit in March 2026.</p>

<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its tail and the particles it emits, have sparked intense scientific debate. Researchers are analyzing data from various observatories, including the Hubble and Gemini space telescopes, to uncover the mysteries of this comet before it exits our solar system permanently.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will cross Jupiter's orbit in March 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet's tail extends approximately 400,000 kilometers and consists of larger dust particles than typical comet tails.</li>
    <li>The average diameter of the dust particles is about 10 micrometers.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at a speed exceeding the Sun's escape velocity.</li>
    <li>Its nucleus is estimated to be between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object and has since been monitored by a global network of observatories. Following its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun in October 2025, researchers noted the persistence of its anomalous tail. Observations leading to December 19, 2025, confirmed its unique characteristics, prompting ongoing studies.</p>

<p>The comet's trajectory has been confirmed as hyperbolic, indicating its origin from outside the Solar System. As it approaches Jupiter in 2026, astronomers anticipate further insights into its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The behavior of 3I/ATLAS’s tail more closely resembles rocket engine exhaust than a natural phenomenon,” said Avi Loeb, a renowned astronomer advocating for a technological origin of the comet.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community has been divided over the nature of 3I/ATLAS. While Loeb proposes that its tail indicates an artificial propulsion mechanism, many researchers argue that its unusual properties can be explained through unique chemical compositions or formation processes distinct from those in our Solar System. This ongoing debate highlights the diversity of celestial objects in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will focus on upcoming observations during its passage near Jupiter in March 2026. These studies are expected to provide critical data that may support or challenge existing theories regarding the comet's origins and characteristics.</p>
