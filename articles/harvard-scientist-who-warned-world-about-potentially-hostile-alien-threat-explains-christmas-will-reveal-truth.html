      <h2>Harvard scientist comments on interstellar object 3I/ATLAS following NASA's new images</h2>

<p>A Harvard scientist has reiterated his concerns about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which he has described as a "potentially hostile alien threat," after NASA released new images of the comet on December 19, 2025. The object, which passed by Mars earlier this year, is currently traveling through our solar system.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as NASA seeks to clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS. The agency has stated that the object behaves like a comet and poses no threat to Earth, while Avi Loeb, the Harvard scientist, continues to analyze the data for further insights.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Nasa's stance:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is a comet and poses no threat</li>
    <li><strong>Scientist's analysis:</strong> Further observations needed to determine true nature</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been tracked as it travels through the solar system, with significant observations made earlier this year when it passed by Mars. NASA has released images of the object, which they describe as behaving like a comet.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has expressed skepticism about NASA's conclusions, suggesting that the object may exhibit behaviors not typical of known comets. He has indicated that the upcoming close approach to Earth will provide an opportunity to gather more data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” NASA stated regarding 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We should not judge a book by its cover... there is still more to learn about 3I/ATLAS,” said Avi Loeb in his latest blog post.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has previously warned about the potential implications of interstellar objects entering our solar system. His claims about 3I/ATLAS have sparked debate within the scientific community regarding the nature of such objects and their possible origins.</p>

<p>The contrasting views between Loeb and NASA highlight ongoing discussions about the classification and understanding of interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming weeks, further observations will be conducted using larger ground-based telescopes, as well as the Hubble and Webb telescopes. These observations are expected to clarify the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS by the time it is closest to Earth.</p>
