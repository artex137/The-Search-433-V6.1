      <h2>Alien Activity? Experts Explain Why 3I/ATLAS Comet's 'Debris Plume' Is Not Visible</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which passed through Earth's solar system in 2025, has lost its debris plume after moving away from the Sun, according to images captured on 5 November 2025. Observers at the R. Naves Observatory in Spain and the Lowell Observatory in Arizona reported the absence of the comet's expected tail, leading to speculation about alien activity, though experts have provided scientific explanations for the phenomenon.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights the unique nature of interstellar comets and the challenges in observing them. Authorities and astronomers have clarified that the loss of the tail is due to the geometry of the comet's orbit and the interference from solar glare, not extraterrestrial influences.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed perihelion on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>It was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at approximately 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Images were taken on 5 November 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass through Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 and made headlines for being the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system. It passed its closest point to the Sun on 29 October 2025. Observations on 5 November 2025 revealed that the comet had lost its expected debris plume, prompting media outlets to speculate about alien activity.</p>

<p>However, experts clarified that the absence of the tail is due to observational conditions, particularly the angle at which the comet was viewed relative to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re just looking the wrong way,” said Qicheng Zhang of the Lowell Observatory, explaining the visibility issues of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The comet remains intact and stable, indicating that no external forces are causing it to disintegrate,” Zhang added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar comets, making its observations particularly important to astronomers. Previous reports of interstellar objects have often spurred speculation about extraterrestrial life, but scientists emphasize the need for careful analysis and understanding of celestial mechanics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS will continue its journey through the solar system and is expected to pass by Jupiter in March 2026, with ongoing observations planned to monitor its trajectory and stability.</p>
