      <h2>3I/ATLAS precise turn for Jupiter means it's a spacecraft that can deploy devices - expert</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has attracted attention due to a series of anomalies reported by Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who suggests it may not be a natural comet but rather an alien spacecraft. The object is expected to reach its closest point to Jupiter on March 16, 2024.</p>

<p>This assertion is significant as it challenges the conventional understanding of comets and raises questions about the potential for extraterrestrial technology. Authorities, including NASA, have yet to confirm or deny these claims, which continue to spark debate within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Expected closest approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 16, 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Claimed anomalies:</strong> 12, according to Professor Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Professor:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li><strong>Potential theories:</strong> Alien spacecraft vs. natural comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Professor Avi Loeb has analyzed 3I/ATLAS and noted its unusual characteristics in a recent blog post. He claims the object has a precisely calculated trajectory towards Jupiter and exhibits jets that could suggest technological origins.</p>
<p>Loeb has stated that the object arrived at perihelion while obscured by the Sun, raising questions about its potential maneuvers during that time. He suggests that the jets observed may have been used for orbital corrections.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is apparent that 3I/ATLAS is an extremely rare and mysterious object, especially if it happens to be a natural comet as argued by NASA officials,” Professor Loeb stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I explained that a spectroscopic measurement of the speed and composition of the jets of 3I/ATLAS would reveal whether they stem from the sublimation of pockets of ice on the surface of a rock or from technological thrusters,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Professor Loeb has previously stirred controversy with his theories regarding extraterrestrial life and technology. His claims about 3I/ATLAS contribute to ongoing discussions about the search for alien life and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, further observations and analyses are expected. The scientific community will likely monitor the object closely to determine its composition and trajectory, as well as to assess the validity of Professor Loeb's claims.</p>
