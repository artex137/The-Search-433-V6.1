      <h2>'Heavenly rains': Ethereal structure in the sky rivals famous 'Pillars of Creation'</h2>

<p>The Gemini Observatory has released a stunning image of the emission nebula NGC 6820 and the open star cluster NGC 6823, located 6,000 light-years away in the constellation Vulpecula. The image was shared on November 19, 2025, to commemorate the observatory's 25th anniversary, showcasing a colorful structure reminiscent of the iconic "Pillars of Creation" from the Eagle Nebula.</p>

<p>This release highlights significant advancements in astronomical imaging and the educational initiatives at the Gemini Observatory. The image has been named Ua ʻŌhiʻa Lani, or Heavenly 'Ōhi'a Rains, by four high school students from the University of Hawaii's Project Hōkūlani summer internship program. The project aims to engage students in astronomy and promote awareness of celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Release of nebula image</li>
    <li>Date: November 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: 6,000 light-years away in the constellation Vulpecula</li>
    <li>Telescopes: Gemini North (Hawaii) and Gemini South (Chile)</li>
    <li>Interns involved: Four local high school students</li>
    <li>Significance: 25th anniversary of the Gemini Observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Gemini North telescope, located on the summit of Maunakea in Hawaii, has been operational since June 1999. The Gemini South telescope in the Chilean Andes achieved first light in November 2000. The recent image was captured to celebrate the observatory's 25 years of discovery.</p>

<p>The students participating in the Project Hōkūlani internship named the image Ua ʻŌhiʻa Lani, reflecting cultural significance and scientific achievement. This initiative aims to inspire future generations in the field of astronomy.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This image is crimson and red like lava because of the abundance of hydrogen gas present in the nebula,” said Hope Arthur, one of the Gemini interns.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“One of Pele's most well-known stories is that of 'Ōhi'a and Lehua. Their story is about regrowth after tragedy and the act of new beginnings, which we felt was evocative of the cycle of stellar life, death, and rebirth,” Arthur added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The baby blue stars in the image reminded us of rain and how, in the story of 'Ōhi'a and Lehua, when you pick the lehua blossoms, it rains,” said Iolani Sanches, another intern.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Gemini Observatory has played a crucial role in astronomical research since its inception. Its twin telescopes provide astronomers with nearly complete access to the night sky, facilitating significant discoveries in the field of space science. The observatory's efforts to involve local students through programs like Project Hōkūlani emphasize the importance of education and community engagement in science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<pThe Gemini Observatory will continue to release captivating images and engage with the public and students to foster interest in astronomy and science education. Further observations of celestial phenomena are anticipated as technology and techniques improve.</p>
