      <h2>3I/ATLAS catches attention of US lawmakers; Republican lawmaker Anna Paulina Luna makes big demands from NASA</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn the attention of US lawmakers after scientists have monitored it for months. Discovered by NASA’s ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025, the comet has prompted Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna to request the release of data and images related to the object. The request follows observations that the comet, which is approximately the size of Manhattan, exhibited signs of non-gravitational acceleration.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the nature of interstellar objects and their interactions with our solar system. Luna’s call for transparency aims to enhance scientific understanding and potentially uncover more about the comet's origins. Her request was directed to acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna made her request on October 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>Luna's letter requested data from NASA's HiRISE camera and the Perseverance Rover.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed within approximately 30 million kilometers (18.6 million miles) of Mars.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has speculated about the comet being alien technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA’s ATLAS telescope discovered the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Following months of observations, on October 2, 2025, Harvard scientist Avi Loeb called for the release of images of the comet. Shortly after, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna sent a letter to NASA, requesting specific observational data and images captured by NASA missions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I write to request the release of specific observational data related to 3I/ATLAS, recently captured by NASA missions,” Luna stated in her letter. “This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object recorded in our solar system, following previous discoveries. The scientific community has shown a keen interest in understanding such objects, particularly regarding their origins and implications for space exploration. The recent observations of 3I/ATLAS have sparked debate about the possibility of advanced technology beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to respond to Luna’s request for data and images, which may lead to further analysis and public discussions regarding the comet and its characteristics.</p>
