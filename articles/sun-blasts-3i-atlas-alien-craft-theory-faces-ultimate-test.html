      <h2>Sun Blasts 3I/ATLAS: 'Alien Craft' Theory Faces Ultimate Test</h2>

<p>On 29 October 2025, astronomers observed the closest approach of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS to the Sun, coinciding with a significant coronal mass ejection from the Sun. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this celestial event.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it presents a unique opportunity for scientists to study the interaction between a known interstellar object and solar phenomena. Astronomers are now awaiting data from the encounter to analyze the effects of the solar blast on 3I/ATLAS, which may provide insights into its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Chile.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the Sun occurred on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to weigh 33 billion tons and has a nucleus between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres wide.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass by Mars soon, allowing for further observations.</li>
    <li>A faint radio signal from 3I/ATLAS was detected by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>The object is travelling at a speed of 137,000 MPH.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project plans to livestream views of 3I/ATLAS on 16 November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS survey in Chile. Following this, the object approached the Sun, reaching its closest point on 29 October 2025. Shortly after this perihelion, a coronal mass ejection occurred, leading to a unique interaction between the Sun's plasma and the comet.</p>

<p>As the event unfolded, scientists prepared to analyze the data from the solar blast and its effects on 3I/ATLAS. The Virtual Telescope Project is set to provide live updates on 16 November 2025, enhancing observational opportunities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This interaction may be profoundly different,” said a NASA spokesperson, highlighting the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS compared to previous similar events.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The effect, however, was only temporary — within minutes a new tail formed,” NASA noted in a blog post regarding the 2007 solar interaction with an asteroid.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interaction between solar material and celestial objects has been observed before, notably in April 2007 when an asteroid experienced a similar encounter with the Sun. However, 3I/ATLAS is significantly larger and of an alien origin, adding complexity to the current analysis.</p>

<p>Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble have confirmed the active nature of 3I/ATLAS, which is rich in nickel and presents an unusual composition. The detection of hydroxyl radicals by the MeerKAT telescope has provided additional insight into the object's characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data from the solar blast and the subsequent observations of 3I/ATLAS. The results may confirm its natural origins or reveal anomalies that keep the possibility of it being an alien craft alive. The upcoming livestream on 16 November will offer further insights.</p>
