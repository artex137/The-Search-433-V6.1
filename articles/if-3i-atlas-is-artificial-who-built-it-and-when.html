      <h2>If 3I/ATLAS is artificial, who built it and when?</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has raised questions about the object known as 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may be a remnant of an ancient civilization. Loeb made his remarks during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. He argues that 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our Solar System, could represent technology rather than a natural formation.</p>

<p>This discussion matters as it challenges existing scientific paradigms about the universe's technological history. Loeb’s claims have sparked interest among researchers and the public, prompting calls for a reevaluation of how we understand interstellar objects and their origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua (2017) and Borisov (2019).</li>
    <li>Loeb suggests 3I/ATLAS may be millions or even hundreds of millions of years old.</li>
    <li>Spectral studies show high concentrations of nickel and low iron content.</li>
    <li>Loeb claims these characteristics resemble human-made aerospace materials.</li>
    <li>The object follows a precise retrograde path aligned within 5° of the planetary plane.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, the first interstellar object, ‘Oumuamua, was detected entering the Solar System. This was followed by the discovery of Borisov in 2019. Recently, 3I/ATLAS has been observed, leading Avi Loeb to propose its potential origins during an interview in October 2023.</p>
<p>Loeb has argued that if intelligent life evolved before humans, it could have developed technology that spread across the galaxy. His remarks suggest that 3I/ATLAS may not be a comet but rather a fragment of advanced technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s behaving more like technology than geology,” said Loeb regarding the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If correct, 3I/ATLAS may not be a comet at all but a fragment or probe casing from a machine built long before human history began,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions about interstellar objects have generally focused on their natural formation. However, Loeb's claims introduce a new perspective that challenges the scientific community to consider the possibility of ancient technological artefacts. The Milky Way's age of 13.6 billion years opens up the potential for civilizations that could have existed long before humanity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb's assertions may lead to further research into the origins of 3I/ATLAS and the characteristics of other interstellar objects. Scientists may begin to construct frameworks for detecting ancient technology in the universe.</p>
