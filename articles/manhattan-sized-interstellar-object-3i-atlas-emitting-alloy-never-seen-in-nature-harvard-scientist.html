      <h2>Manhattan-sized interstellar object 3I/ATLAS emitting alloy never seen in nature: Harvard scientist</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, comparable in size to Manhattan, is emitting a metal alloy that has never been observed in nature, according to Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb. New images captured by the Keck II telescope in Hawaii in August have revealed that the object is producing a plume containing four grams of nickel per second, without any detectable iron, a phenomenon not previously documented in comets.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about comet compositions. Authorities are currently awaiting additional data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which captured images of 3I/ATLAS as it passed within 12 million miles of Mars from October 4 to October 7. However, these images have not been released due to a government shutdown impacting NASA's communications department.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: Comparable to Manhattan</li>
    <li>Emission: Four grams of nickel per second, no iron detected</li>
    <li>Images taken: August 2025 by Keck II telescope</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: Within 12 million miles</li>
    <li>Images from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter: Taken between October 4 and October 7, 2025</li>
    <li>Current status: Images pending release due to government shutdown</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The object 3I/ATLAS was first photographed by the Hubble Telescope on July 21, 2025. Subsequent observations were made in August by the Keck II telescope, which confirmed the unusual emissions of nickel tetracarbonyl. As of October 2025, images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter remain unreleased due to the ongoing government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is only one place where that is known to exist and that is in industrially produced nickel alloys,” Loeb said. “This was never observed for any other object.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We usually see beautiful tails extending from the object away from the Sun, and in this case there was no evidence for such a tail,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar comets have shown comparable amounts of nickel and iron, making the absence of iron in 3I/ATLAS notable. The refined compound emitted by this object is typically used in metal coatings within the aerospace industry, raising questions about its origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers anticipate the release of images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which will provide crucial data on 3I/ATLAS. The ongoing government shutdown may delay this process further.</p>
