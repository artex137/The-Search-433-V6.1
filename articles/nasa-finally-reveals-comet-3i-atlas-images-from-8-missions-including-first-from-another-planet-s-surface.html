      <h2>NASA Finally Reveals Comet 3I/ATLAS Images From 8 Missions, Including First From Another Planet's Surface</h2>

<p>NASA has released images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS captured during eight different missions, including the first images taken from the surface of another planet. The space agency held a press conference on October 3 to unveil these findings, which include observations made by the Perseverance rover on Mars.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it marks the first time observations of a comet have been made from the surface of another planet. The data collected during these missions will enhance scientific understanding of the comet and its origins. Observations from Mars, where the comet was approximately 30 million kilometers (18.6 million miles) away, are particularly important as the comet approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2021, by NASA-funded ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>First observations from another planet's surface taken by Perseverance on October 4, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million kilometers (167 million miles).</li>
    <li>Images captured by eight missions, including Perseverance, MAVEN, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>Comet is an interstellar object, the third known after 1I/’Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA’s Perseverance rover spotted 3I/ATLAS on October 4, 2025, after images were collected on October 3. Observations also included data from the European Space Agency's Trace Gas Orbiter and the Chinese Tianwen-1. Further observations were made by MAVEN and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The Psyche and Lucy missions also captured images from September 8 to September 16, 2025, at distances of 33 million miles and 240 million miles, respectively.</p>

<p>In addition, missions that monitor the Sun, including NASA’s STEREO and the ESA/NASA SOHO mission, tracked the comet as it passed behind the Sun in recent months.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“[3I/ATLAS] is a really exciting object. It’s an interstellar visitor to our planetary system. Right now, we cannot travel to other planetary systems, but luckily, pieces come to us!”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s behaving like a comet, it looks like a comet, it moves like a comet, thus it’s a comet,”</blockquote> said Dr. Matthew Genge, Associate Professor in Earth and Planetary Science at Imperial College London.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike these earlier objects, 3I/ATLAS is believed to be much older, potentially twice the age of the Solar System. Its discovery and subsequent observations offer valuable insights into the formation and history of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA plan to continue observations of 3I/ATLAS, with ESA’s Jupiter-bound mission JUICE set to collect data in November. The upcoming closest approach to Earth on December 19 will provide further opportunities for study and analysis.</p>
