      <h2>Trump UFO announcement predicted to come in just DAYS after mysterious 'insider' tip</h2>

<p>The odds of President Donald Trump revealing information about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have surged, with a prediction of disclosure expected within days. A betting pool on the cryptocurrency platform Polymarket has seen over $7 million wagered, with the probability of Trump declassifying UFO files rising from six percent on December 6 to 98 percent as of Tuesday morning, December 9, 2025.</p>

<p>This surge in betting activity has sparked interest among experts and UFO researchers. They believe that insider information may have influenced the sudden increase in bets. Additionally, the Trump Administration faces pressure to fulfill promises to declassify various government records, including those related to UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Polymarket betting pool has exceeded $7 million.</li>
    <li>Odds of declassification have increased from 6% to 98% since December 6.</li>
    <li>More than $5 million has been wagered since Monday at 6 PM ET.</li>
    <li>Trump has previously indicated a desire to disclose UFO information.</li>
    <li>New federal law requires the Department of Justice to publish unclassified Epstein-related materials by December 19.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 6, 2025, the odds of Trump declassifying UFO files stood at six percent on Polymarket. Following a surge of betting activity, these odds dramatically increased to 98 percent by December 9. The increase is attributed to aggressive buying from a small group of traders, which has raised speculation about an imminent announcement.</p>
<p>In the same timeframe, Polymarket users have reportedly made significant individual trades, with some buying over $20,000 worth of 'Yes' shares in the UFO disclosure market. This activity has contributed to the overall confidence in the possibility of an announcement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I think someone on the inside close to Trump knows this and has been buying, hence the rise,” said UFO researcher and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Trump stated in a 2024 podcast that he would “love to do that” regarding the release of UFO information.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previously, the U.S. military and NASA have denied any encounters with UFOs or alien life. Despite this, government whistleblowers have claimed that multiple alien spacecraft and bodies have been recovered over the decades. These claims remain unverified.</p>
<p>In 2025, the odds against Trump disclosing UFO files had been heavily stacked, even after the release of a documentary titled “The Age of Disclosure.” The recent surge in betting activity marks a significant shift in public interest and speculation surrounding UFO disclosures.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>If the predictions hold true, the Trump Administration must officially declassify any previously classified files about extraterrestrial life or unexplained aerial phenomena by the end of 2025. The outcome of this situation will likely depend on the administration's response to ongoing public and legislative pressure.</p>
