      <h2>New images show anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS measured at greater length than Earth-Moon distance</h2>

<p>Recent observations of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS have revealed an anti-tail extending more than the average distance between Earth and the Moon. As of December 14–15, 2025, the object was approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth and is expected to approach a perigee distance of 268.9 million kilometers on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the largest anti-tail observed for any comet or interstellar object to date. Observations from telescopes in Italy, California, and Thailand show this sunward-pointing anti-tail measuring approximately 500,000 kilometers long. Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to better understand its evolution as it moves away from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth as of December 14–15, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is expected to reach a perigee distance of 268.9 million kilometers on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The anti-tail extends approximately 500,000 kilometers from the nucleus.</li>
    <li>Observations have been conducted from telescopes in Calabria, Italy; June Lake, California; and Rayong, Thailand.</li>
    <li>Observations began with the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS was first recorded in a Hubble Space Telescope image when the object was 2.98 astronomical units (AU) from Earth. The anti-tail remained visible in subsequent images, including one taken on November 30, 2025, at 1.91 AU.</p>

<p>On December 13, 2025, a 0.26-meter telescope in Rayong, Thailand, captured images confirming the anti-tail’s presence. The following day, a 0.25-meter telescope in Calabria, Italy, produced an image highlighting the anti-tail's sunward extension.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest approach to Earth, allowing further observations of its anti-tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor involved in the observations, stated, "The images demonstrate that the anti-tail consistently points in the direction of the Sun, confirming its structure."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Anti-tails are typically temporary perspective effects observed when Earth crosses the orbital plane of a comet. However, for 3I/ATLAS, the anti-tail has shown persistence, indicating it is a physical feature rather than a mere perspective effect. Previous comets have not exhibited anti-tails of this scale.</p>

<p>Peer-reviewed studies suggest that the anti-tail may result from sunlight scattering by icy fragments or from a swarm of objects lagging the nucleus due to non-gravitational acceleration. Ongoing monitoring aims to analyze these phenomena further.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations will continue to gather data on the anti-tail's structure and formation as 3I/ATLAS approaches its perigee. Information collected during this time will enhance understanding of interstellar objects and contribute to a comprehensive catalog of interstellar observations.</p>
