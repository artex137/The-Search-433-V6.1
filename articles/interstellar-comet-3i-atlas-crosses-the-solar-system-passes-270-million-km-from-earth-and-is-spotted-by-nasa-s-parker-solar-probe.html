      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS crosses the Solar System</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has passed within 270 million km of Earth, with images captured by NASA's Parker Solar Probe between October 18 and November 5, 2025. The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado and approached its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it enhances scientific understanding of the comet's orbital evolution and behavior. The Parker Solar Probe's observations during this period allow for a more detailed study of the comet, which was previously inaccessible to direct observations from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars occurred on October 3, 2025, at 0.194 AU.</li>
    <li>Perihelion was reached on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth was on December 19, 2025, at 270 million km.</li>
    <li>The Parker Solar Probe captured approximately 10 images of the comet daily.</li>
    <li>The WISPR instrument aboard the Parker Solar Probe conducted the observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado discovered the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. It reached perihelion on October 30, 2025. The Parker Solar Probe captured images of the comet between October 18 and November 5, 2025, during which the comet was positioned behind the Sun from the probe's perspective.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet passed within 270 million km of Earth, generating increased interest among scientists regarding its characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new images from the Parker Solar Probe will allow for a more precise study of this interstellar visitor,” said a member of the WISPR team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation marks a significant opportunity for scientists to gather data on an interstellar object, which has not been easily accessible for study. Previous encounters with interstellar comets have provided limited data, making this event particularly noteworthy for ongoing research in the field of astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The WISPR team will continue to adjust the data from the Parker Solar Probe to enhance image clarity and accuracy, allowing for further analysis of the comet's behavior and composition.</p>
