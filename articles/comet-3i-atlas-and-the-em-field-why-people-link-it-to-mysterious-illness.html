      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS and the 'EM Field': Why People Link It to Mysterious Illness</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, moving through our solar system at approximately 209,000 kilometres per hour, has sparked conversations about its potential connection to reports of unusual health symptoms. Observers have noted instances of headaches, fatigue, and malaise coinciding with the comet's appearance, leading to speculation about its electromagnetic activity.</p>

<p>The interest surrounding 3I/ATLAS is not just astronomical; it has prompted discussions about public health and scientific inquiry. Authorities are monitoring the situation, but no official link between the comet and reported illnesses has been confirmed. The trending phrase 'NASA interstellar comet electromagnetic field' reflects the intersection of scientific observation and public concern.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently travelling at 209,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Reports of illness, including headaches and fatigue, have circulated on social media.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma contains significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methanol.</li>
    <li>NASA's Lucy mission confirmed the comet's trajectory on 16 September 2025.</li>
    <li>The James Webb Space Telescope plans its final observation of the comet in January 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 21 July 2025, early images from the Hubble Space Telescope captured the comet's dust cocoon. By September, NASA's MAVEN mission detected a hydrogen halo surrounding the comet. As the comet approached, social media discussions about potential health impacts began to intensify.</p>

<p>On 7 December 2025, a TikTok user posted about experiencing flu-like symptoms, suggesting a link to the comet. This post garnered significant attention, prompting further speculation online about the comet's effects on health.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Something feels off... #MysteriousIllness tied to 3I/ATLAS,” wrote TikTok user @fuelyourmind10, reflecting the growing public concern.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has mentioned that while there are intriguing anomalies, he considers them to have a low probability of being linked to extraterrestrial phenomena.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time celestial events have been linked to health concerns. Historical instances of comets and meteor showers have often sparked public intrigue and speculative theories. However, scientific consensus typically attributes observed health issues to other environmental factors.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of empirical evidence supporting claims of direct health impacts from 3I/ATLAS, the comet's passage has reignited discussions about the effects of cosmic events on human health.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to monitor public health reports as 3I/ATLAS moves out of the solar system. Investigations into the comet's composition will proceed, with the James Webb Space Telescope set to conduct its final observations in January 2026.</p>
