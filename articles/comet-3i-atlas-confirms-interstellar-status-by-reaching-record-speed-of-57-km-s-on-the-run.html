      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas confirms interstellar status by reaching record speed of 57 km/s on the run</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, the third confirmed interstellar object in history, has reached a speed of 57 km/s, following a hyperbolic trajectory that will permanently take it outside the Solar System. The phenomenon was recorded by international observatories after the comet's perihelion on October 30, 2025, when it passed 210 million kilometers from the Sun, between the orbits of Earth and Mars. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it confirms the interstellar origin of Comet 3I/Atlas and provides insights into the dynamics of celestial objects ejected from other star systems. Authorities and researchers are currently using data collected from the Hubble and James Webb telescopes to refine the comet's trajectory and study its chemical composition, which suggests a formation in a much older star system than our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas reached a speed of <strong>57 km/s</strong>.</li>
    <li>It passed <strong>210 million kilometers</strong> from the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet follows a hyperbolic trajectory, ensuring permanent escape from the Solar System.</li>
    <li>Current speed exceeds the speed of the first interstellar object, <strong>Oumuamua</strong>, which was <strong>26 km/s</strong>.</li>
    <li>Data collected by the <strong>Hubble</strong> and <strong>James Webb</strong> telescopes.</li>
    <li>The comet's chemical composition suggests material up to <strong>7 billion years old</strong>.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate emissions of gaseous jets causing extra acceleration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2025, Comet 3I/Atlas reached its perihelion, passing at a distance of 210 million kilometers from the Sun. Observatories around the world recorded its speed of 57 km/s shortly after this event. Continuous monitoring by international telescope networks has been ongoing to refine the trajectory of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The combination of high speed and open trajectory guarantees that the comet will not be captured by solar gravity,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This represents a unique opportunity to study material from another region of the Milky Way,” noted a representative from the Hubble Space Telescope team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since 2017, only three bodies with a hyperbolic trajectory have been confirmed, highlighting the rarity of interstellar visitors. The previous interstellar object, Oumuamua, was observed traveling at a much lower speed of 26 km/s, making 3I/Atlas an exceptional case in the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches the outer boundaries of the Solar System. The ongoing data collection aims to enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>
