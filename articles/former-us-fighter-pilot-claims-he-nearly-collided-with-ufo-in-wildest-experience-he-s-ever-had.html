      <h2>Former US fighter pilot claims he nearly collided with UFO in ‘wildest experience’ he’s ever had</h2>

<p>Maj. Ryan Bodenheimer, a former US Air Force fighter pilot, has described a near-collision with a UFO during a training mission in southern Wyoming, calling it one of the “wildest experiences” of his military career. The incident occurred while Bodenheimer was flying at 30,000 feet and 400 knots (460 mph) earlier this month.</p>

<p>This account is significant as it adds to the growing number of reports from military pilots about unidentified aerial phenomena. Authorities are reportedly investigating these encounters, with a focus on understanding the nature of these objects and their implications for air safety.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in southern Wyoming.</li>
    <li>Bodenheimer was flying at 30,000 feet and 400 knots (460 mph).</li>
    <li>The object was described as a "perfect rectangle," approximately 30 to 40 feet high.</li>
    <li>Air traffic control was notified, but no further information was provided.</li>
    <li>Wyoming has a history of UFO sightings, with over 421 reported since 1995.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During a training mission, Maj. Ryan Bodenheimer spotted a bright object in the sky that he believed was on a collision course with his aircraft. He prepared to take control of his jet but realized they would not collide as the object came into clearer view. Bodenheimer described the object as a rectangular shape with bright edges. After the object zoomed away, he reported the encounter to air traffic control.</p>

<p>Following the report, Bodenheimer noted a “dead silence” from the controller, who indicated that other aircraft would be alerted to look for the object. Bodenheimer later discovered a report of an “anomalous object” in the area on the same day.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was like essentially a perfect rectangle,” Bodenheimer said, describing the object he encountered. “There’s no wings on this thing, no exhaust. The edges were so bright they were pulsing.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I never heard anything about it [after],” he added regarding his communication with air traffic control.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Southern Wyoming is known for its high number of UFO sightings. The city of Cheyenne, home to Warren Air Force Base, has reported over 50 aerial phenomena since 1995. Bodenheimer noted that he had previously refrained from discussing his encounters due to the stigma associated with such reports among military pilots.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating UFO sightings and reports from military personnel as awareness and discussion around the phenomenon increase. Bodenheimer's account may prompt further examination of aerial safety protocols and the nature of unidentified objects in controlled airspace.</p>
