      <h2>Composition clues of 3I/ATLAS: Nickel, Cyanide and Carbon-chain depletion</h2>

<p>The detection of cyanide radicals around comet 3I/ATLAS has confirmed that its nucleus contains typical cometary volatiles, similar to those found in Solar System comets. The findings, reported recently, indicate that 3I/ATLAS formed in a cold outer region of its home star system, where nitrogen-rich ices can condense and survive for billions of years.</p>

<p>This research matters because it offers insights into the early chemical conditions of the system from which 3I/ATLAS originated. The presence of nickel-bearing species and the depletion of carbon-chain molecules suggest that the comet has experienced significant cosmic-ray processing over long periods, impacting its chemical makeup.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Key findings: Detection of cyanide radicals and nickel-bearing species</li>
    <li>Carbon-chain depletion observed, particularly in C₂ and C₃ molecules</li>
    <li>Similarities noted with interstellar comet 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li>Indicates formation in a metal-rich protoplanetary disk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent spectroscopic observations have detected cyanide radicals around 3I/ATLAS. These findings confirm the presence of typical cometary volatiles similar to those in Solar System comets. The observations also reveal nickel-bearing species in the comet's coma, mirroring earlier findings in 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>The research indicates that 3I/ATLAS likely formed in a cold outer region of its home star system, where nitrogen-rich ices can survive for billions of years. The depletion of carbon-chain molecules suggests that the comet has undergone significant cosmic-ray exposure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The low abundance of C₂ and C₃ in 3I/ATLAS is consistent with extreme cosmic-ray processing, indicating the object has spent enormous spans of time in interstellar space, far from any protective star,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior research on interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, has shown similar chemical signatures. The study of 3I/ATLAS further supports the understanding that comets can have distinct chemical compositions based on their formation environments.</p>

<p>The differences in composition between 3I/ATLAS and known Solar System comets strengthen the evidence that 3I/ATLAS is not a captured Oort Cloud object, but rather a genuine interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations are likely to focus on the chemical processes that have shaped 3I/ATLAS, as well as the implications for understanding the formation of comets in different stellar environments.</p>
