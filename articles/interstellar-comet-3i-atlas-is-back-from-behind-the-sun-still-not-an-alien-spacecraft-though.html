      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Back From Behind The Sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has re-emerged after reaching its closest approach to the Sun on October 24, 2023. The PUNCH mission, a group of small satellites studying the Sun, observed the comet as it exited the Sun's glare. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object tracked through our Solar System. Astronomers have noted that the comet is more active than previous interstellar visitors, 1I/’Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. The comet's recent perihelion has generated excitement in the scientific community, particularly as it may provide insights into the characteristics of objects originating from other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 24, 2023.</li>
    <li>It is currently within the orbit of Mars and moving away from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, at a distance of 269 million kilometers (167 million miles).</li>
    <li>Observations using the European Space Agency's JUICE mission are scheduled for November 2 and November 25.</li>
    <li>Data from JUICE is expected to be downloaded in February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 24, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, marking its closest approach to the Sun. Following this, the PUNCH mission successfully detected the comet as it emerged from the Sun's glare. The comet has been reported to exhibit increased activity, including a peculiar anti-tail and a possible jet.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, the European Space Agency plans to observe the comet on two occasions, utilizing various instruments on the JUICE spacecraft. The closest approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“JUICE will observe 3I/ATLAS between 2 and 25 November. We will be using five instruments: the camera, the near-infrared imaging instrument, the UV spectrometer, the sub-millimetre instrument, and a sensor to image neutral atoms,” said Olivier Witasse, ESA Project Scientist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object detected in our Solar System, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Previous observations have shown that interstellar objects can provide valuable data about the formation and evolution of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its perihelion, comet 3I/ATLAS will continue to be monitored by both professional and amateur astronomers as it moves away from the Sun. Upcoming observations by the JUICE mission will contribute to the understanding of this interstellar object.</p>
