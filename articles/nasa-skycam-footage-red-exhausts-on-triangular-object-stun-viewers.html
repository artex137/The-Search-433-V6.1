      <h2>NASA SkyCam Footage: 'Red Exhausts' On Triangular Object Stun Viewers</h2>

<p>A recently captured NASA SkyCam video featuring a triangular object with what witnesses describe as 'red exhausts' has captivated audiences online. The footage, which has sparked widespread discussion on social media, shows the object flying near the International Space Station (ISS) earlier today. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting has reignited interest in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and prompted viewers to question the authenticity of the footage. Experts in space technology have stated that the reports do not align with any known NASA mechanism, suggesting that the object might be misidentified. The video is circulating online, although it has not been officially posted by NASA.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Footage captured by a NASA SkyCam showing a triangular object.</li>
    <li>Witnesses reported the object emitting prominent 'red exhausts'.</li>
    <li>Event occurred near the International Space Station (ISS) earlier today.</li>
    <li>The video has gone viral on social media platforms, particularly on X.</li>
    <li>Dr. Horace Drew, a scientist and inventor, shared the video and commentary.</li>
    <li>NASA has not confirmed the authenticity of the footage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Earlier today, a video captured by a NASA SkyCam shows a triangular object near the ISS at approximately 0:38 seconds into the recording. The object appears to emit red exhausts, prompting numerous viewers to comment online. At 1:00, both video and audio signals are reportedly turned off by NASA.</p>

<p>Dr. Horace Drew later shared the footage on X, inviting viewers to question the explanations typically provided for such sightings. He also posted additional recordings to support his claims about the sighting.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “A large triangular UFO flew near the ISS earlier today. Everyone can see two big RED exhausts.” – Dr. Horace Drew
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “For me, it is enough to document a real, spectacular UFO, and not get caught up in other information that may be a deliberate fake.” – Dr. Horace Drew
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting follows a trend of increased public interest in UFOs and unexplained aerial phenomena. Previous incidents have similarly generated debate over the credibility of reported sightings and the responses from space agencies. Experts have often cited misidentification as a common explanation for such occurrences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the footage and its implications are ongoing. NASA has not issued a formal statement regarding the video or its authenticity, and the conversation about unexplained phenomena is expected to continue among viewers and experts alike.</p>
