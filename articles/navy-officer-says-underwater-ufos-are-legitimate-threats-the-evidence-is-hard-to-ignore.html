      <h2>Navy Officer Says Underwater UFOs Are Legitimate Threats</h2>

<p>In mid-2014, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Ryan Graves, while conducting training flights off the coast of Virginia Beach, Virginia, observed unusual radar returns that indicated unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Graves reported these anomalies, which displayed remarkable speed and precision, during a series of encounters with fighter jets from his squadron. No injuries or fatalities were reported during these incidents.</p>

<p>This matter has garnered significant attention as military officials and advocates for transparency push for a better understanding of these phenomena. Graves, now retired, has become a leading voice for the UAP community, advocating for greater acknowledgment and investigation of these objects. The U.S. government has begun to take steps toward addressing these concerns, including the recent passage of the UAP Disclosure Act.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Graves began noticing UAPs during training flights in mid-2014.</li>
    <li>The sightings occurred off the coast of Virginia Beach, Virginia.</li>
    <li>Graves recorded UAPs moving at speeds ranging from 0.0 Mach to 1.2 Mach.</li>
    <li>UAPs were observed both hovering and darting away at supersonic speeds.</li>
    <li>Graves has founded Americans for Safe Aerospace, focusing on pilot safety regarding UAPs.</li>
    <li>In 2023, Congress passed the UAP Disclosure Act, requiring federal agencies to disclose information on UAPs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In mid-2014, Lieutenant Graves began observing unusual radar anomalies during training flights. Over the following year, his squadron recorded almost daily sightings of UAPs, which appeared to exhibit unique flight characteristics. In 2020, footage of UAP incidents involving Navy fighter jets was made public. In 2023, the UAP Disclosure Act was passed by Congress, mandating the collection and disclosure of records related to UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This wasn’t business as usual. There was a serious issue at play,” Graves said regarding the UAP sightings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I knew then that what I saw was not our technology,” said Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet, emphasizing the need for further investigation into these phenomena.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The possibility that they exist underwater is very real,” Gallaudet stated, highlighting the need for prioritizing research on UAPs.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Reports of unidentified submerged objects (USOs) have existed since at least the 1950s. These USOs often display characteristics that challenge current understandings of physics and navigation. The increased sightings and advancements in radar technology have intensified interest in these phenomena, leading to calls for transparency and research from military personnel and scientists alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Graves and Gallaudet are continuing to advocate for UAP investigations and transparency. The U.S. government is expected to respond to the momentum created by the UAP Disclosure Act, potentially leading to further research and public disclosures related to unidentified aerial and submerged objects.</p>
