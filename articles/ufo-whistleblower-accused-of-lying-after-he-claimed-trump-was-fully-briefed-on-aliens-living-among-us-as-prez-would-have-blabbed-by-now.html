      <h2>UFO Whistleblower Accused of 'Lying' About Trump's Knowledge of Aliens</h2>

<p>US Air Force Major David Grusch has claimed that former President Donald Trump was "fully briefed" on what the US government knows about aliens living among humans. Grusch made these statements in a recent interview, but faces accusations of dishonesty regarding Trump's ability to keep such information secret.</p>

<p>Grusch's assertions, made during an interview with Fox News, have raised questions about government transparency and the existence of extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including the White House and the US military, have not confirmed any claims of alien contact or technology recovery, maintaining that no evidence supports these allegations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Grusch claims Trump received briefings on crashed spacecraft and non-human remains.</li>
    <li>Grusch worked with the UAP Task Force from 2019 to 2021.</li>
    <li>He testified before Congress in 2023 about secret government UFO programs.</li>
    <li>The White House, US military, and NASA have denied claims of alien contact.</li>
    <li>Public reaction includes skepticism about Trump's knowledge of aliens.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2019, David Grusch began working with the UAP Task Force, which investigates unidentified aerial phenomena. He became a whistleblower after alleging that certain government elements obstructed Congressional oversight regarding extraterrestrial matters. In 2023, Grusch testified before Congress, claiming that secret government departments have operated UFO retrieval and reverse-engineering programs for decades.</p>

<p>In a 2024 interview with Joe Rogan, Trump commented on aliens, stating there is "no reason" to disbelieve in their existence, though he has expressed skepticism about the specifics surrounding Area 51.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Members of this current administration are very well aware of this reality,” Grusch claimed. “Certainly, the current president is very knowledgeable on this subject.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Trump knows nothing. He would have blabbed by now,” a social media user stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Utter and complete garbage!” another user reacted to Grusch's claims.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Grusch's claims come amidst a growing public interest in UFOs and government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. Recent testimonies and investigations have raised questions about the extent of government knowledge and secrecy surrounding extraterrestrial life. Previous incidents, including the Roswell crash in New Mexico, have fueled speculation about alien technology and contact.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As public interest continues to grow, further investigations into Grusch's claims and the government's handling of UFO-related information are expected. No specific timelines or deadlines for these investigations have been disclosed.</p>
