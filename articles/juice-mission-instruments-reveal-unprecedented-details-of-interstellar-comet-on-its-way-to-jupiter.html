      <h2>Juice mission instruments reveal unprecedented details of interstellar comet on its way to Jupiter</h2>

<p>The Juice probe, operated by Agência Espacial Europeia, has conducted an unscheduled data collection on the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas as it travels towards the Jovian system. The data collection was performed using high-precision sensors, which analyzed the comet's chemical composition.</p>

<p>This data collection is significant as it validates the calibration of the probe's instruments, which were originally set to remain inactive during this phase of the mission. The findings will help scientists compare the composition of 3I/Atlas with known materials from our own solar system, enhancing the understanding of celestial formations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Probe:</strong> Juice, operated by Agência Espacial Europeia</li>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Data collection:</strong> Conducted during cruise phase, unexpectedly</li>
    <li><strong>Instrument:</strong> Instrumento de Ondas Submilimétricas (SWI)</li>
    <li><strong>Next major maneuvers:</strong> Passes through Terra in 2026 and 2029</li>
    <li><strong>Final destination:</strong> Orbit of Ganimedes by 2034</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2025, Juice completed a flyby of Vênus to adjust its orbital inclination. This maneuver was part of a series of gravitational assists designed to increase the spacecraft's speed for its journey to Jupiter.</p>
<p>Currently, the probe is en route to perform strategic passes through Terra, scheduled for 2026 and 2029, as part of its preparation for orbital insertion.</p>
<p>The long-term goal of the mission is to study the icy moons of Jupiter, with a focus on Ganimedes, which is believed to contain a vast ocean of liquid water beneath its frozen surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The ability to detect the release of volatile materials from a celestial body so distant and at high speed validates the calibration of equipment for future scientific operations,” mission controllers stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Juice mission aims to explore the icy moons of Jupiter, particularly Ganimedes, due to its potential to host underground oceans. This exploration could provide insights into the geological processes at work on these distant bodies and the potential for life.</p>
<p>The successful operation of the SWI instrument during this unexpected data collection demonstrates the mission's readiness for future scientific endeavors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Juice probe will continue its journey towards Jupiter, with upcoming passes through Terra in 2026 and 2029, leading to its goal of entering Ganimedes' orbit by 2034.</p>
