      <h2>NASA Spots Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Flare Up During Solar System Exit</h2>

<p>NASA has shared new infrared images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has brightened significantly during its exit from the solar system. The images were captured by NASA’s SPHEREx telescope in December 2025.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it is only the third known object to enter our solar system from interstellar space, according to NASA. This rare comet may provide insights into the composition of other solar systems and the origins of organic molecules essential for life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>At its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2025, the comet traveled at 153,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Infrared images were taken by the SPHEREx telescope in December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet released a variety of organic molecules, including methanol, cyanide, and methane.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is composed of about one-third water ice.</li>
    <li>The SPHEREx mission was launched on March 11, 2025, with a two-year objective.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, while traveling at approximately 137,000 miles per hour. The comet accelerated as it approached the sun, reaching its peak speed of 153,000 miles per hour during perihelion on October 30, 2025. Following this close encounter, the comet exhibited a bright outburst as it exited the solar system, which was captured in infrared images by SPHEREx in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet has spent ages traversing interstellar space, being bombarded by highly energetic cosmic rays, and has likely formed a crust that’s been processed by that radiation,” said Phil Korngut, the mission's instrument scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, after its close flyby of the sun, causing it to significantly brighten,” noted Carey Lisse of Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable because it is one of the few interstellar objects identified passing through our solar system. The study of such comets can enhance our understanding of the building blocks of life and the formation of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue analyzing the data collected by the SPHEREx telescope, which aims to study over 450 million galaxies and 100 million stars in the Milky Way during its two-year mission.</p>
