      <h2>NASA Uses 3I/ATLAS to Test Earth's Defences Against Future Space Threats</h2>

<p>NASA scientists and international partners are studying the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the Solar System. This event, which began earlier this year, offers a unique opportunity to refine early-warning and tracking techniques for potential cosmic threats. Researchers have stated that while the comet poses no danger to Earth, it is valuable for testing global coordination and data-sharing systems used in planetary defence.</p>

<p>The tracking of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it marks only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed, following 2017's 'Oumuamua and 2019's 2I/Borisov. As part of the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), the exercise allows scientists to compare telescope data and improve orbital modelling techniques, enhancing readiness for future threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First detected:</strong> earlier this year by ATLAS telescope in Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmed interstellar objects:</strong> third, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Exit from Solar System:</strong> expected by early 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Participating organizations:</strong> NASA, IAWN, multiple observatories and amateur astronomers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Hawaii earlier this year. Following its discovery, the IAWN launched an observing exercise, allowing global astronomers to share data and improve tracking techniques. As of now, the object is continuing its hyperbolic orbit through the Solar System.</p>

<p>NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) has indicated that while this is not a formal 'impact rehearsal,' the ongoing observation drills serve a similar purpose in enhancing interagency communication and readiness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is not a threat, but it offers an excellent chance to evaluate how our systems respond to unusual objects,” IAWN stated on its official website.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Every observation counts. 3I/ATLAS may be just passing through, but it's helping us prepare for what could one day make all the difference,” IAWN added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This exercise follows previous observational campaigns conducted by NASA and IAWN with passing asteroids. However, the interstellar nature of 3I/ATLAS presents unique challenges, as these objects travel faster and follow unpredictable paths, limiting the time available for precise data collection. The success of NASA's DART mission in 2022 has also demonstrated that deflection of potentially hazardous bodies is technically feasible.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS will help shape future protocols for near-Earth object monitoring and support research into impact-prevention methods. NASA and IAWN will continue to refine their techniques and communication systems in preparation for any future cosmic threats.</p>
