      <h2>Not an alien signal: How radio data proved comet 3I/Atlas is natural</h2>

<p>On October 24, the South African MeerKAT radio telescope detected hydroxyl absorption lines from comet 3I/Atlas, confirming its natural origin and dispelling theories of alien technology. The detection occurred just days before the comet reached its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it highlights the importance of scientific investigation in the face of sensational claims. Authorities are now focusing on further observations to understand the comet's behavior and characteristics as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas detected by MeerKAT on October 24, 2023.</li>
    <li>Radio signals measured hydroxyl (OH) absorption lines at 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz.</li>
    <li>Detection occurred five days before the comet's closest approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Increased solar heating caused sublimation, producing OH molecules.</li>
    <li>NASA's Juno spacecraft plans to observe the comet in 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 24, 2023, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected hydroxyl signals from comet 3I/Atlas. This detection was made just five days before the comet's closest approach to the Sun. The observed hydroxyl signals indicated normal cometary behavior rather than artificial emissions.</p>

<p>Following the detection, astrophysicist Avi Loeb acknowledged the findings and emphasized the need for continued monitoring of the comet's OH production and tail structure. This approach reflects standard scientific caution.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“A mysterious signal turned out to be textbook comet chemistry, fully consistent with known physics and observations of many other icy bodies,” said a representative from the MeerKAT team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is an interstellar visitor, and its detection has generated considerable public interest and speculation about its origins. Previous claims about alien technology have often arisen during similar astronomical events, prompting scientists to clarify findings through rigorous analysis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its journey, scientists will conduct further observations to monitor its properties, with NASA's Juno spacecraft set to listen for low radio frequencies in 2026. The ongoing investigation aims to deepen understanding of cometary behavior in the solar system.</p>
