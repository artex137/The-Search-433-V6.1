      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may have emitted a radio signal detected 48 years ago, says astrophysicist</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist from Harvard University, has proposed that the Wow! radio signal detected on August 15, 1977, by the Big Ear radio telescope in Ohio, may have originated from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet is currently passing through the Solar System, having been discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</p>

<p>This hypothesis is significant as it suggests a possible link between the 1977 radio signal and a known celestial object. The scientific community continues to analyze the data and monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Wow! signal detected on August 15, 1977, lasted 72 seconds.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was approximately 600 astronomical units from Earth in August 1977.</li>
    <li>Comet's approach speed estimated at 60 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Signal strength varied between 54 and 212 Jansky.</li>
    <li>Perihelic passage on October 29, 2025, at 203 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Proximity to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 270 million kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 15, 1977, the Wow! radio signal was detected, leading to ongoing debates regarding its extraterrestrial origin. In July 2025, the ATLAS telescope discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet's trajectory has since been analyzed, revealing its hyperbolic orbit and the potential connection to the Wow! signal.</p>

<p>NASA and ESA probes have monitored the comet throughout its approach, with significant observations made in October 2025 and planned analyses between November 2 and 25, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The angular separation of the comet from the Wow! signal coordinates represents a statistical rarity,” said Loeb, emphasizing the need for further observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Wow! signal has remained a topic of intrigue since its detection, with no repeating signals recorded to date. The connection suggested by Loeb has sparked both interest and skepticism within the scientific community.</p>

<p>Recent emissions from 3I/ATLAS have included unusual amounts of nickel and iron, further complicating the analysis of its chemical composition and origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, scientists will continue to utilize both ground- and space-based telescopes to search for potential emissions and further understand the comet's characteristics. The comet is expected to be visible in the morning sky starting November 11, 2025.</p>
