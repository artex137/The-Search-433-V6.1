      <h2>Could Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) Trigger a Market Crash?</h2>

<p>Bank of England officials have been urged to prepare for a potential market crash linked to the announcement of alien life, according to a letter from financial analyst Helen McCaw. The request comes in light of ongoing discussions about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), which have gained renewed attention following the release of a documentary titled "The Age of Disclosure" in November 2025.</p>

<p>The documentary, featuring U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, focuses on the potential implications of non-human intelligent life and advanced technology. McCaw, who has worked at the Bank of England for over ten years, has raised concerns about how UAPs could impact monetary policy and financial markets. She has called for contingency plans in case the U.S. government confirms the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Helen McCaw wrote to Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England.</li>
    <li>The letter was prompted by a recent article in the Times.</li>
    <li>McCaw has over ten years of experience at the Bank of England.</li>
    <li>She previously authored a white paper on UAP implications for the UK government.</li>
    <li>The U.S. Department of Defense reported 708 UAP incidents in the air domain and 49 in space in 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2025, the documentary "The Age of Disclosure" was released, reigniting discussions about UAPs. This documentary features prominent U.S. officials, including Marco Rubio, discussing the implications of non-human intelligent life.</p>

<p>In January 2025, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard addressed UAPs as part of her confirmation hearing, highlighting them as a significant intelligence issue. Following this, McCaw wrote a letter to the Bank of England's governor, emphasizing the need for financial preparedness regarding the potential disclosure of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Even if you feel it’s very unlikely, it’s madness not to consider it and plan accordingly,” said Helen McCaw in her letter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There might be extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophizing or euphoria,” McCaw added, referring to potential investor reactions to UAP disclosure.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Discussions about UAPs have been ongoing for decades, with increasing attention from government agencies. The U.S. Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office released a report in November 2024, detailing numerous UAP incidents. The topic has become more prominent, with various governments, including those of Canada and Japan, engaging with the U.S. on UAP issues.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Bank of England has not commented on McCaw's letter, leaving her proposal as a private advocacy matter for now. Future discussions on UAPs and their implications for financial markets are anticipated as more information becomes available.</p>
