      <h2>What is the Nucleus Size of 3I/ATLAS?</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has raised significant questions about the size of its nucleus, as discussed recently in a recorded session involving Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and scientists Peter Skafish, Brian Keating, and Michael Shermer. The discussions took place on October 3, 2025, and highlighted the ongoing efforts to understand this celestial body as it approaches Mars.</p>

<p>This inquiry matters because determining the nucleus size of 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into its composition and origins. Authorities are preparing to use the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to image the comet and gather data that could clarify its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass 29 million kilometers from Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The HiRISE camera has a resolution of 30 kilometers per pixel.</li>
    <li>The nucleus diameter is estimated to be between 5 kilometers and 46 kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to come within 54 million kilometers of Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a mass significantly larger than 2I/Borisov, which had a diameter of approximately 0.5 kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured the sharpest image of 3I/ATLAS, revealing a glow of scattered sunlight but no visible tail. This indicated that the light was primarily from icy fragments rather than dust. Discussions surrounding the object intensified as scientists sought to understand the implications of its size and composition.</p>
<p>The upcoming imaging by the HiRISE camera on October 3, 2025, is anticipated to provide crucial data regarding the nucleus size and brightness, offering a more precise understanding of 3I/ATLAS compared to previous observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The glowing cloud around 3I/ATLAS is optically thin. Hence, the total luminosity emanating from the central pixel in the HiRISE image will provide a strict upper limit on the nucleus brightness and hence its size.” 
    <strong>Avi Loeb, Head of the Galileo Project</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The inquiry into 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader interest in interstellar objects. Previous objects, such as 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, exhibited different characteristics that posed challenges for study. Understanding 3I/ATLAS could pave the way for future missions aimed at exploring other interstellar objects more effectively.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the imaging on October 3, 2025, researchers will analyze the data to determine the nucleus size of 3I/ATLAS. Future missions may consider deploying interceptors to capture detailed images of other interstellar objects as they approach the solar system.</p>
