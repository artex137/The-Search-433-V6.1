      <h2>A Giant Telescope Searched 3I/ATLAS For Signs of Aliens. Here's Why.</h2>

<p>A dedicated scan for signs of radio-transmitting technology in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has returned with no detectable signals. The Breakthrough Listen project utilized the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope to listen for several hours on December 18, 2025, just a day before the comet's closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>This search is significant as it highlights the scientific community's efforts to explore the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. Although the findings confirmed that 3I/ATLAS does not emit radio signals indicative of alien technology, researchers argue that the search was essential for verifying existing knowledge about the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Search for radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of search: December 18, 2025</li>
    <li>Method: Observations using the Green Bank Telescope</li>
    <li>Duration of observations: 5 hours</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth (perigee): Approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet's discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): Late October 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, calculations indicated that it originated from outside the Solar System. The comet reached perihelion in late October, and on December 19, it made its closest approach to Earth at a distance of about 270 million kilometers. On December 18, the Breakthrough Listen project conducted a search for signals using the Green Bank Telescope.</p>

<p>During the observations, the telescope alternated between focusing on the comet and other areas of the sky every five minutes. This method allowed researchers to filter out any signals that were not related to 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet,” said NASA associate administrator Amit Kshatriya in November.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Even finding nothing tells us something,” said physicist Paul Ginsparg of Cornell University. “Wild speculation can sometimes inform the next generation of instrumentation, which can then either confirm or refute the wild hypothesis, or see something else entirely and unexpected.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The search for extraterrestrial life is a key focus in the field of astronomy. Previous searches have often yielded no evidence of alien technology, but they provide valuable insights into the nature of celestial bodies. The exploration of 3I/ATLAS adds to the ongoing scientific dialogue about the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The results of this search have been made available on preprint server arXiv. Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS and other celestial objects to enhance understanding of their characteristics and origins.</p>
