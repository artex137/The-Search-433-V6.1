      <h2>Barack Obama: Aliens ‘Are Real, But I Haven’t Seen Them’</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has commented on the existence of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during an interview with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen, which was posted on Saturday. Obama stated, “Uh, they’re real, but I haven’t seen them.” He addressed the speculation surrounding Area 51, a classified military site in Nevada, asserting that there is no evidence of extraterrestrial beings being housed there.</p>

<p>This statement has reignited public interest in UFOs and government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Lawmakers have increasingly called for clarity on military programs that study these occurrences, which some regard as potential national security threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interview posted on February 15, 2026, by Brian Tyler Cohen.</li>
    <li>Obama’s comments included a dismissal of claims about alien technology at Area 51.</li>
    <li>Former presidents have previously inquired about UFOs, including Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.</li>
    <li>Area 51 and Wright Patterson Air Force Base are noted locations for alleged secret government research.</li>
    <li>Government interest in UAPs has increased, particularly following a House hearing on the topic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, the topic of UFOs has garnered significant attention. In 1989, scientist Bob Lazar claimed involvement in a classified project at Area 51. In 2017, a New York Times article revealed a secret Pentagon program tracking UAPs, which included official military footage of unidentified aerial phenomena. This led to increased scrutiny and calls for transparency from lawmakers.</p>

<p>During his presidency, Obama’s chief of staff, John Podesta, advocated for the release of UFO files, stating that his biggest failure was not securing this disclosure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Uh, they’re real, but I haven’t seen them,” Obama said during the interview.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Where are the aliens?” Obama asked, reflecting on his curiosity upon entering the White House.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Former CIA Director George H.W. Bush reportedly refused Jimmy Carter’s request for access to UFO files, stating that curiosity was not sufficient reason for disclosure.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around UFOs and government secrecy has a long history, with significant public interest peaking during the late 20th century. The recent disclosures and official acknowledgment of UAPs have shifted the narrative from ridicule to serious investigation. Lawmakers like Marco Rubio and the late Harry Reid have been pivotal in advocating for transparency.</p>

<p>The emergence of credible testimonies, such as that of whistleblower David Grusch, has further intensified the debate over government knowledge of extraterrestrial life and technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAPs continue, with lawmakers pushing for further transparency from the Pentagon regarding its programs. The public can expect ongoing discussions and potential disclosures related to UFO sightings and government responses in the near future.</p>
