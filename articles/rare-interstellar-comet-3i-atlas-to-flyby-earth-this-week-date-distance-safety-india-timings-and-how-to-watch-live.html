      <h2>Rare interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS to flyby Earth this week</h2>

<p>Astronomers are preparing for the closest approach of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS to Earth on December 19, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2023, by NASA-funded ATLAS telescopes in Chile, this comet is the third confirmed interstellar visitor observed in our solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it offers scientists a unique opportunity to study material formed around another star. The European Space Agency has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS will pass Earth at a distance of about 1.8 astronomical units, or approximately 270 million kilometres, which is twice the distance between Earth and the Sun. Authorities have stated that this distance ensures safety from any potential impact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar visitors:</strong> ‘Oumuamua (2017) and comet Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream start time:</strong> 11 PM EST on December 18, 2025 / 9:30 AM IST on December 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS telescopes in Chile. Following its discovery, scientists confirmed its interstellar nature, determining it originated from outside the Sun’s gravitational influence. The comet is expected to complete its flyby on December 19, 2025, after which it will exit the solar system, never to return.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, various space agencies and observatories have directed their instruments towards the comet, capturing new images as it travels through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The flyby offers a rare opportunity to study the material formed around another star,” said a representative from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets is crucial for understanding the formation of comets and planetary systems beyond our solar system. Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects, ‘Oumuamua and comet Borisov, have been confirmed, marking this event as a significant milestone in astronomical research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will analyze the gas and dust released from its icy nucleus, which will provide insights into the composition of material from other star systems. Observations will continue as the comet makes its close approach, with live coverage available for skywatchers.</p>
