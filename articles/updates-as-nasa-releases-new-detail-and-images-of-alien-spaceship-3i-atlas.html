      <h2>NASA releases new details and images of comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has announced new details and images of comet 3I/ATLAS during a press conference on November 19, 2025, at 8 p.m. GMT. The agency confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet and is not an alien spacecraft, despite speculation from some experts.</p>

<p>This announcement matters as it aims to clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which has generated significant public interest and debate regarding its origins. NASA has emphasized that the comet poses no threat to Earth and is only the third object ever identified as entering the solar system from outside our galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: November 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Press Conference Time: 8 p.m. GMT</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 19 million miles</li>
    <li>Speed of Comet: 130,000 mph</li>
    <li>Notable Participants: Amit Kshatriya, Nicky Fox, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, Tom Statler</li>
    <li>NASA's Classification: Confirmed as a comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS flew within 19 million miles of Mars, capturing the attention of astronomers and the public alike. Speculation arose regarding the comet's nature, with some suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft. On November 19, 2025, NASA addressed these claims in a press conference, providing new images and confirming the object as a comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is a comet, and it poses no threat to Earth,” said a NASA spokesperson during the press conference.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Its anomalies suggest it might be an extraterrestrial spaceship,” suggested Professor Avi Loeb, a theoretical physicist, prior to the announcement.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third object identified as entering the solar system from another galaxy. The public fascination with the potential for extraterrestrial life often leads to speculation about such objects, despite scientific classifications indicating otherwise.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, and further studies may be conducted to analyze its composition and trajectory.</p>
