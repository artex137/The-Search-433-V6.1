      <h2>No words – just knowing: two military UFO witnesses speak out on the same day</h2>

<p>Two military witnesses have reported their experiences with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during a press conference held on October 4, 2023, in Washington, D.C. Both witnesses, who have served in the U.S. Air Force and Navy, described their encounters with UFOs while on duty. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks a growing trend of military personnel coming forward to share their experiences with UFOs, also known as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). The U.S. government has been under pressure to address these sightings and provide transparency about investigations into UAPs.</p>
