      <h2>Avi Loeb 'Visibly Frustrated' As NASA Ignores 3I/ATLAS Anomalies At Live Event</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has expressed frustration after <strong>NASA</strong> officials dismissed his concerns about unexplained features in comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> during a live broadcast on <strong>Newsmax</strong>. The exchange occurred on <strong>October 12, 2023</strong>, where both parties presented differing interpretations of the object's behaviour.</p>

<p>This matter is significant because it highlights ongoing debates within the scientific community regarding the nature of interstellar objects. Loeb has raised questions about the data NASA has released, suggesting that the anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS warrant further investigation. NASA maintains that the object is a natural comet, while Loeb argues for a more cautious interpretation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of broadcast: October 12, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Newsmax live event</li>
    <li>Object in question: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars during observation: approximately 19 million miles</li>
    <li>NASA acting Administrator: Sean Duffy</li>
    <li>NASA's position: 3I/ATLAS is a comet</li>
    <li>Loeb's main concern: seven jets emanating from 3I/ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Loeb and NASA officials discussed 3I/ATLAS during a live broadcast on October 12, 2023. Loeb presented his observations regarding the object's anomalies, including its non-standard acceleration and lack of a dust tail. NASA's Sean Duffy reiterated the agency's classification of 3I/ATLAS as a comet, citing its typical comet-like behaviour.</p>
<p>Loeb highlighted the slow release of high-resolution data from the HiRISE camera, captured during the object's close approach to Mars. Duffy attributed delays to staffing shortages due to the US government shutdown. Loeb countered this explanation, stating there had been ample time to process the images.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The foundation of science is the humility to learn, not the arrogance of expertise.” — Avi Loeb
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It walks like a comet, talks like a comet, struts like a comet. It's a comet.” — Sean Duffy
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We've had 45 days since the images were taken ... They definitely had plenty of time.” — Avi Loeb
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader discourse on the classification of interstellar objects. Previous observations of 3I/ATLAS have revealed unusual features that have drawn scrutiny from various astronomers, raising questions about the limits of current scientific understanding. Some experts, including Penn State's <strong>Jason Wright</strong>, have dismissed Loeb's calculations as flawed.</p>
<p>Loeb has advocated for considering low-probability events, suggesting that the implications of alternative explanations could be significant for science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As NASA continues to release data regarding 3I/ATLAS, Loeb remains committed to challenging the agency's interpretations. The debate surrounding the object is expected to persist as new evidence emerges and further analyses are conducted.</p>
