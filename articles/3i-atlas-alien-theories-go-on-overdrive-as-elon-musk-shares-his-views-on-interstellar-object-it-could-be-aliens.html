      <h2>3I/ATLAS Alien Theories Go On Overdrive As Elon Musk Shares His Views On Interstellar Object: 'It Could Be Aliens'</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 1 July 2025, has sparked intense speculation about its origins, especially after comments from Tesla CEO Elon Musk during a recent interview. The comet, which is the third confirmed visitor from another star system, is currently on an escape trajectory through our Solar System, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it has reignited discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Experts, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have suggested that the comet's unusual features warrant further investigation. Authorities and scientists are actively monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with telescopes tracking its trajectory and velocity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Its perihelion occurred on 30 October 2025.</li>
    <li>It is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025 at a distance of 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Current velocity is 57 km/s with a dust cross-section of 230 km².</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS, which has since captured the attention of the scientific community and the public. The comet has exhibited anomalous accelerations, including a radial acceleration of 1.1x10<sup>-6</sup> au per day squared away from the Sun and a transverse acceleration of 3.7x10<sup>-7</sup> au per day squared.</p>

<p>On 30 October 2025, the comet reached its perihelion, revealing its growing ion tail in recent images taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. A detected radio signal from the comet has been confirmed as natural, despite initial suggestions of extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<p>As it approaches its closest point to Earth on 19 December 2025, telescopes worldwide are monitoring its trajectory closely, analyzing its characteristics for clues to its origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No, there are definitely comets and asteroids which are primarily made of nickel,” Musk stated, addressing claims of artificial origins.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It could be alien, I don't know,” Musk added, further fueling speculation about the comet's nature.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It would obliterate a continent type of thing,” Musk warned when discussing potential collision risks, emphasizing the seriousness of the discovery.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery follows the earlier findings of 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, both of which have also drawn attention for their unusual characteristics. The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS highlights the ongoing tension between imaginative speculation and empirical evidence in astronomy.</p>

<p>Experts have noted that while public interest in alien theories is high, a growing body of evidence suggests that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet rather than an extraterrestrial spacecraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its approach towards Earth, NASA plans to release high-resolution images that may provide clearer insights into the comet's nature and origins. Scientists are calling for enhanced detection systems to better monitor future interstellar objects.</p>
