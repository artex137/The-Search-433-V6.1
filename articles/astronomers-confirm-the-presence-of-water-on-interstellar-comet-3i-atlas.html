      <h2>Astronomers confirm the presence of water on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers from Auburn University has confirmed the presence of water on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which passed through our solar system this summer. The discovery was made using NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, revealing that the comet is releasing approximately 40 kilograms of water per second.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it marks only the third interstellar object known to exist and highlights the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. The research provides insight into how water and organic molecules might be transported across galaxies, potentially supporting the emergence of life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed during the summer of 2025.</li>
    <li>Auburn University led the research team, including astrophysicist Zexi Xing.</li>
    <li>The comet releases about 1.36 × 10²⁷ water molecules per second.</li>
    <li>Observations were made in late July and mid-August 2025.</li>
    <li>The hydroxyl signal nearly doubled between the two observation periods.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus radius is approximately 2.8 kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late July 2025, astronomers at Auburn University began observing comet 3I/ATLAS using the Swift Observatory. They detected faint emissions from the comet's coma, indicating the presence of water. By mid-August, they noted that the hydroxyl signal had nearly doubled, suggesting a significant increase in water production as the comet approached the Sun.</p>

<p>The researchers utilized a method known as motion correction to effectively capture the comet's activity, allowing them to analyze the gas envelope surrounding the nucleus. This analysis confirmed that the comet is actively releasing water vapour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “When we see water—or even its faint ultraviolet echo—coming from an interstellar comet, we're reading a message from outside our planetary system. It says the chemical building blocks for life are not unique to our own,” said Dennis Bodewits, co-author of the study and Auburn physics professor.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable data, with 'Oumuamua showing no signs of gas activity and Borisov releasing water and carbon monoxide in equal quantities. The discovery of water activity in 3I/ATLAS at such distances challenges existing theories about comet behavior and formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to return after mid-November 2025, providing astronomers another opportunity to observe its activity as it nears the Sun. Continued observations may reveal whether the comet’s water activity remains consistent or if other gases become prominent as solar heating increases.</p>
