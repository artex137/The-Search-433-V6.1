      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb Flags The Weird Geometry Around Exocomet In Latest Hubble Images</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has identified unusual geometric patterns in the images of exocomet 3I/ATLAS, which were captured by the Hubble Space Telescope on January 14, 2026. The findings come after the comet was discovered by the ATLAS observatory on July 1, 2025, and have sparked interest among both experts and the public.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its behavior, particularly regarding its unusual anti-tail and jet formations. NASA has previously downplayed speculations regarding the comet, asserting it is a standard comet. However, Loeb's observations challenge this narrative and have yet to be addressed by other scientists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS observatory.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the exocomet on January 14, 2026.</li>
    <li>The glow around 3I/ATLAS extends over 130,000 kilometers towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has identified at least 17 anomalies in the exocomet's behavior.</li>
    <li>Loeb's latest findings include a prominent anti-tail and three mini-jets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS observatory discovered 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third interstellar object to enter the solar system. The comet gained attention on social media, especially regarding NASA's delayed release of data. On November 20, 2025, NASA held a press conference, stating the comet was a typical comet and releasing a cache of related information. On January 14, 2026, Hubble images revealed new details about the comet's structure, prompting further analysis from Avi Loeb.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "What is the nature of the anti-tail that allows it to penetrate hundreds of thousands of kilometers through the Solar wind and radiation without being deflected away from the Sun?"</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows 1I/Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019. Both prior interstellar objects generated significant scientific interest and debate regarding their origins and characteristics. The ongoing research into 3I/ATLAS continues this trend, as scientists seek to understand more about interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb's research on 3I/ATLAS is ongoing, as he continues to analyze the data from Hubble and other observatories. Further studies may address the anomalies he has identified and their implications for our understanding of cometary behavior in the solar system.</p>
