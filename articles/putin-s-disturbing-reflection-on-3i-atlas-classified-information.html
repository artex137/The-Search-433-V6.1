      <h2>Putin's disturbing reflection on 3I/ATLAS: "Classified information"</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention from NASA and scientists globally, prompting a response from Russian President Vladimir Putin during a press conference in Moscow on December 19, 2025. Putin addressed questions regarding the nature of the comet and any potential threats it may pose to Earth.</p>

<p>This matter is important as it touches on the ongoing debate among scientists about the classification of 3I/ATLAS, with some suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft. Putin's comments reflect the Russian government's stance that the interstellar object is not a threat to Earth and aligns with the views of many scientists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of press conference: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance of 3I/ATLAS from Earth at closest approach: 268.91 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Key figures involved: President Vladimir Putin, Harvard professor Avi Loeb</li>
    <li>NASA's position: 3I/ATLAS is a comet</li>
    <li>Putin's statement about classified information: "It is our secret weapon..."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2025, during a press conference in Moscow, a journalist inquired about the Russian intelligence services' stance on 3I/ATLAS and whether it could be an alien spacecraft. President Putin responded with irony, suggesting the information was classified and reaffirming that it is a comet. He stated that Russian scientists are aware of the situation and emphasized that the object poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>On the same day, Harvard professor Avi Loeb released a post on Medium, echoing Putin's statements and noting the comet's behavior. He highlighted that 3I/ATLAS had not shown any unusual activity or maneuvers during its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’ll tell you, but it must stay between us because it is classified information. It is our secret weapon, but we will only use it in extreme cases, as we oppose the deployment of weapons in space.” — President Vladimir Putin</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS ignores Earth. Some consider this message insulting. Therefore, we should not be surprised that interstellar visitors, who attended the party for much longer, did not plan to dance with us.” — Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS marks the third object identified as originating from outside our solar system. The object has sparked various theories regarding its nature. While NASA maintains it is a comet, some experts, including Avi Loeb, have speculated it may be a spacecraft due to its unusual acceleration patterns.</p>

<p>Previous incidents involving unidentified aerial phenomena have led to public interest and debate about potential extraterrestrial technology, contributing to the current discussions surrounding 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for any changes in behavior. NASA and other space agencies are expected to release further findings as they study the comet's trajectory and characteristics.</p>
