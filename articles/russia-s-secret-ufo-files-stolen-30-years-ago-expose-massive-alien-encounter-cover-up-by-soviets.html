      <h2>Russia's Secret UFO Files Expose Soviet Cover-Up</h2>

<p>Secret files smuggled out of Russia have revealed that the Soviet leadership documented thousands of UFO encounters while publicly denying their existence. The documents were released on 16 January 2023 by journalist George Knapp, who obtained them during the aftermath of the USSR's collapse in 1993.</p>

<p>This revelation sheds light on the Soviet military's covert investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena, contradicting decades of official denials. The files indicate that the Soviet government took the UFO situation seriously, launching numerous secret research programs to study the occurrences.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documents released on 16 January 2023 by George Knapp.</li>
    <li>First covert program began in 1979, known as 'Network-AN'.</li>
    <li>Other initiatives included 'Galaxy-MD' (1981-1985) and 'Pluton 7' (1989).</li>
    <li>Notable sighting in Nalchik occurred on 13 February 1989, involving a 450-foot-wide jellyfish-shaped UFO.</li>
    <li>Children in Derzhavinsk, Kazakhstan, reported encounters with 10-foot-tall aliens on 27 June 1979.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1953, the Soviet regime publicly declared UFOs to be fabrications of American imperialists. Despite this, they began investigating UFO sightings in secret.</p>
<p>In 1979, the USSR initiated the 'Network-AN' program, followed by 'Galaxy-MD' from 1981 to 1985. As sightings increased, they launched 'Pluton 7' in 1989 and continued with the 'Thread 3' program.</p>
<p>On 13 February 1989, a significant sighting in Nalchik involved hundreds of witnesses, including military personnel, who observed a massive UFO performing a light display.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By releasing these documents now, George Knapp is expanding the public record, showing not only how seriously Russia confronted the UFO phenomenon,” said Jeremy Corbell, investigative journalist and partner on Knapp's Weaponized podcast.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The files indicate that the UFO phenomenon was a significant concern for the Soviet Union, countering the narrative that such matters were exclusive to the West. The release of these documents alters the understanding of global UFO history during the Cold War.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any ongoing investigations or potential follow-up actions regarding the released documents. The public and researchers are expected to scrutinize the findings for further insights into the Soviet military's UFO encounters.</p>
