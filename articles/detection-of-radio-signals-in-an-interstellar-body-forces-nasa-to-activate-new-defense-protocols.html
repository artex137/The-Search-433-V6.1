      <h2>Detection of radio signals in interstellar body forces NASA to activate new defense protocols</h2>

<p>NASA has activated new defense protocols after detecting radio emissions from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. The signals were captured following the comet's passage through solar perihelion, prompting global space agencies to enhance data processing and orbital surveillance.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it offers a unique opportunity to test Earth's defense systems against fast-moving bodies. Authorities have noted that although there is no imminent risk of collision, the event has led to a review of global monitoring systems to ensure preparedness for any future threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Detection date: Following perihelion passage, December 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 27 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Travel speed: 100,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Detection by: ATLAS warning system in Chile and Hawaii</li>
    <li>Signals intercepted by: MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa</li>
    <li>Gaseous composition: Presence of hydroxyl (OH) detected</li>
    <li>Significance: Third confirmed interstellar object after 'Oumuamua and comet Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS passed through solar perihelion, prompting the detection of radio emissions. The ATLAS warning system in Chile and Hawaii first identified the object, which travels at a speed of 100,000 kilometers per hour. The closest approach to Earth occurred in December 2025, at a distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</p>

<p>During its passage, scientists utilized the MeerKAT radio telescope to intercept specific radio signals, particularly focusing on the 1.6 GHz spectral line, indicating the presence of volatile substances. This discovery has provided insights into the object's composition and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS serves as a fundamental practical exercise for NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office,” a NASA spokesperson said. “We have taken this opportunity to calibrate our sensors and validate orbit projection models.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Every second of data collection is valuable as the observation window quickly closes,” said a researcher involved in the analysis. “We aim to gather as much information as possible before the object moves further into deep space.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS follows the previous observations of interstellar objects, including 'Oumuamua and comet Borisov. These encounters have prompted ongoing research into the origins and characteristics of celestial bodies that traverse our solar system from other star systems.</p>

<p>This incident highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and advanced detection technologies, particularly as space agencies work to understand the implications of panspermia and the distribution of organic materials across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS until it crosses the outer limits of the solar system. The focus will be on consolidating data to enhance future detection technologies and develop potential missions to intercept similar interstellar objects.</p>
