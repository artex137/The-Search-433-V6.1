      <h2>Alien spaceship or just a rock? Scientific study suggests this space object could be an alien ship</h2>

<p>A newly discovered object, named 3I/ATLAS, has entered our Solar System, capturing the attention of astronomers. While there have been no reported injuries or fatalities, the object's unusual characteristics have sparked considerable interest and debate within the scientific community.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it challenges existing paradigms about interstellar objects. Authorities, including NASA, are investigating the object's true nature, with a specific focus on its trajectory and brightness. The findings could provide insights into the origins of similar cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 20 km across</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Entered the Solar System, date not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025, at a distance of 29 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>NASA classification:</strong> Confirmed as a comet</li>
    <li><strong>Notable features:</strong> Retrograde orbit and unusual brightness</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed entering the Solar System, with its unusual behaviour noted by astronomers. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has proposed that the object could be more than just a typical comet or asteroid. NASA later confirmed the object as an interstellar comet, providing further detail on its hyperbolic orbital path.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2025, 3I/ATLAS will pass close to Mars, allowing for detailed imaging by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By far, the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet, and we await the astronomical data to support this likely origin,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Astronomers have categorised this object as interstellar because of the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path,” confirmed NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to a growing list of interstellar objects that have been detected in recent years. There is increasing interest in understanding these objects and their origins, particularly as more are expected to be identified in the coming decade.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations continue, researchers will focus on gathering more data about 3I/ATLAS, especially during its upcoming close approach to Mars in 2025. This will help determine whether it is indeed a comet or something else entirely.</p>
