      <h2>UFOs? 'Strange light' across Irish sky believed to be caused by US rocket launch</h2>

<p>Stargazers in Ireland reported seeing a "strange light" moving across the sky on Wednesday at approximately 6:30 PM. The light was observed in multiple counties, including Cork, Dublin, Tipperary, and Galway. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The phenomenon has been attributed to the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which occurred earlier that day. Authorities and experts have confirmed that the light was likely caused by excess fuel being released during the rocket's ascent, which freezes and reflects light, creating a visible display. Alan O’Reilly, known as Carlow Weather on social media, provided insights into the event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on Wednesday at approximately 6:30 PM.</li>
    <li>Visible across counties Cork, Dublin, Tipperary, and Galway.</li>
    <li>SpaceX launched 29 Starlink satellites from Florida.</li>
    <li>SpaceX was founded by Elon Musk in 2002.</li>
    <li>Over 2,500 Starlink satellites have been launched in 2025 alone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida, deploying 29 Starlink internet satellites into orbit. Shortly after the launch, reports of a strange light began to surface from various locations across Ireland. By 6:30 PM, the light was widely visible, leading to speculation and theories on social media about its origin. On Thursday, it was confirmed that the light was linked to the Falcon 9 launch.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The light was moving quite quickly and was very confusing,” said Alan O’Reilly, speaking to RTÉ's Morning Ireland. He noted that he received multiple reports of the light being visible across the country.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>SpaceX has been actively launching satellites as part of its Starlink project, which aims to provide global broadband internet coverage. The company has launched thousands of satellites into orbit, contributing to a growing presence of space debris and concerns regarding satellite congestion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no investigations or official actions planned regarding the sighting, as it has been attributed to the SpaceX launch. Authorities will continue to monitor satellite activity and its impact on the night sky.</p>
