<p>Dan Aykroyd has explored UFOs and the supernatural in the third season of his show, The Unbelievable, which premiered recently. The comedy legend, known for his roles in Ghostbusters and The Blues Brothers, continues to engage audiences with stories of the strange and unexplained.</p>

<p>The new season is significant as it combines entertainment with education, encouraging viewers to research unexplained phenomena. Aykroyd has expressed his desire to inspire curiosity about these topics, reflecting his long-standing fascination with UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Show title:</strong> The Unbelievable</li>
    <li><strong>Season:</strong> Third season</li>
    <li><strong>Host:</strong> Dan Aykroyd</li>
    <li><strong>Notable case discussed:</strong> 1994 Ariel School sighting in Zimbabwe</li>
    <li><strong>Research organization:</strong> Mutual UFO Network (MUFON)</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Dan Aykroyd has been interested in UFOs for many years. His mother had a sighting in Ottawa in 1947, which influenced his fascination with the subject. Over the years, Aykroyd has reported his own sightings, including two glowing orbs in Martha’s Vineyard and a rectangular object in Montreal.</p>

<p>In the latest season of The Unbelievable, Aykroyd focuses on the Ariel School sighting, where numerous children reported seeing a UFO. He has followed this story closely and believes it to be a compelling case.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every human being is astounded by unbelievable acts of survival, unbelievable weather events, and stories that just drop your jaw,” Aykroyd said. “I thought, this is a great opportunity to entertain people, educate people, and inspire them to do their own research.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I think the new term — unexplainable aerial platform — just sounds more scientific,” Aykroyd said regarding the U.S. government's discussion of UAPs. “For years people like me have been talking about these things, and now governments are admitting: we can’t explain it either.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Aykroyd’s interest in UFOs is not a recent phenomenon. Previously, he has been vocal about his beliefs and experiences, contributing to the ongoing discourse surrounding UFOs and UAPs. His connection to the Mutual UFO Network highlights a broader trend of increasing public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
