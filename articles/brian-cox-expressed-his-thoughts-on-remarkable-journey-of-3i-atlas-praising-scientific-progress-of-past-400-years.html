      <h2>Brian Cox expresses thoughts on 'remarkable' journey of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Professor Brian Cox has discussed the significance of comet 3I/ATLAS during a BBC interview following its discovery by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025. The comet, one of only three interstellar objects ever detected, has drawn widespread attention from the scientific community and the public alike.</p>

<p>Cox emphasized the importance of the comet as a time capsule from the early universe, noting its estimated formation 7.5 billion years ago. He highlighted the rapid advancements in astronomy over the past 400 years, which have allowed humanity to observe and photograph interstellar objects. NASA is currently attempting to capture images of 3I/ATLAS using the Perseverance rover on Mars, although confirmation of success has not yet been provided.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
<li>Estimated to have formed 7.5 billion years ago.</li>
<li>Comet has been traveling through interstellar space for approximately 10 billion years.</li>
<li>NASA is attempting to capture images of the comet using the Perseverance rover.</li>
<li>European Space Agency (ESA) captured images before the comet passed behind the Sun.</li>
<li>Multiple telescopes, including James Webb and Hubble, have been used to observe the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, ATLAS identified the comet 3I/ATLAS moving through the Solar System. Since its discovery, astronomers have confirmed it as a comet due to observed outgassing. The scientific community has focused on the comet's trajectory, utilizing various telescopes and spacecraft to gather data.</p>

<p>Prior to the comet's passage behind the Sun, the ESA successfully captured images using the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. NASA has been working to capture images of 3I/ATLAS using the Perseverance rover on Mars, although results have not yet been confirmed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There’s an estimate from a couple of days ago that it might have formed seven and a half billion years ago,” said Cox. “It’s been on its journey across the Milky Way galaxy, and the thing I find remarkable, [...] it’s only 400 years [ago] that we were arguing about whether the Earth went around the Sun.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“So that, to me, is a remarkable story,” Cox added, reflecting on the achievements in astronomy over the centuries.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows a growing interest in interstellar objects, which provide insights into the early universe. The comet's long journey through space makes it a point of fascination for both scientists and the public. The advancements in technology have allowed for unprecedented observation of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it progresses through the Solar System, and both NASA and ESA will pursue further imaging opportunities. The ongoing observations aim to enhance understanding of the comet and its origins.</p>
