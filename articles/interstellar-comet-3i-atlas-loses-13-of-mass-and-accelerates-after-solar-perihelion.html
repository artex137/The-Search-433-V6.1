      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS loses 13% of mass and accelerates after solar perihelion</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile, has lost over 13% of its mass following perihelion on October 30, 2025, due to ice sublimation. Astronomers from NASA and ESA have observed non-gravitational acceleration during this period, attributed to the ejection of gases from the comet.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it enhances understanding of how interstellar objects interact with solar radiation. Researchers are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and behavior, as its unique characteristics provide insights into early stellar evolution.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of perihelion: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Mass loss: greater than 13%</li>
    <li>Radial acceleration: 1.1×10⁻⁶ au/day²</li>
    <li>Transverse acceleration: 3.7×10⁻⁷ au/day²</li>
    <li>Proximity to Earth: 268 million km on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: between 400 meters and 5.6 km</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile. It entered the Solar System at high speed, exceeding 50 km/s. Telescopes in Hawaii and Australia confirmed its interstellar nature shortly after its discovery. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, where it experienced significant mass loss due to solar heat causing intense sublimation of ice.</p>

<p>Observations revealed that the ejection of gases resulted in a radial acceleration of 1.1×10⁻⁶ au/day². By November, gas plumes became visible, and the brightness of the comet increased fivefold between September and November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This acceleration does not change the general route but highlights differences as in interstellar visitors,” said a representative from NASA's JPL.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originates from another star system. Its interactions with solar radiation are of particular interest, as they provide data on how objects from distant origins behave as they approach the Sun.</p>

<p>Previous studies of Oort comets have shown similar acceleration patterns, but the intensity observed in 3I/ATLAS is greater, prompting astronomers to adjust orbital models weekly to track its movement.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS, focusing on its mass loss, brightness decay, and potential fragmentation. The ESA's JUICE spacecraft plans additional observations to quantify the ejection of gases and refine current analyses.</p>
