      <h2>China uses Mars orbiter to snap interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>China has successfully captured images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using its Tianwen-1 orbiter in early October, matching a previous achievement by the European Space Agency. The comet was first spotted in July and is noted for its highly eccentric, hyperbolic orbit, indicating it originated from outside the solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this event.</p>

<p>This accomplishment is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object observed by humanity, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2020. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has highlighted the difficulties of photographing such a distant and fast-moving target, which moves at approximately 58 kilometers per second. The orbiter's image of the comet was released today, showcasing China's growing capabilities in space exploration.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
  <li>The comet’s diameter is approximately 5.6 kilometers.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS passed within 30 million kilometers of Mars.</li>
  <li>The Tianwen-1 orbiter captured images in early October 2023.</li>
  <li>The comet moves at a speed of about 58 kilometers per second.</li>
  <li>The relative velocity of 3I/ATLAS compared to Tianwen-1 is 86 kilometers per second.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, leading to its classification as an object from outside the solar system. The Minor Planet Center noted its unique orbit.</p>
<p>In early October 2023, the European Space Agency utilized its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express to observe the comet as it approached Mars. Shortly thereafter, the CNSA announced that its Tianwen-1 had also captured images of the comet.</p>
<p>On November 6, 2023, the CNSA released images of 3I/ATLAS taken by the Tianwen-1 orbiter, highlighting the challenges faced in capturing the comet due to its speed and size.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Shenzhou-20 manned spacecraft is suspected of being struck by a small piece of space debris, and impact analysis and risk assessment are underway,” a CNSA spokesperson stated regarding a separate mission complication.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of interstellar comets is a rare event, with 3I/ATLAS being only the third such object documented. Previous discoveries include 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have generated significant interest in the scientific community due to their origins and characteristics.</p>
<p>In addition to the achievements in comet observation, the CNSA has faced challenges, such as the recent postponement of the Shenzhou-20 return flight due to damage from space debris, underscoring the risks associated with space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The CNSA will continue to analyze the images and data collected from 3I/ATLAS. Further assessments of the Shenzhou-20 spacecraft are also ongoing, with no timeline disclosed for its return mission.</p>
