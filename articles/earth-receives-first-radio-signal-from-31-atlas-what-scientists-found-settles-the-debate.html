      <h2>Earth Receives First Radio Signal From Comet 3I ATLAS</h2>
<p>On November 16, 2025, scientists have confirmed that Earth has received its first radio signal from comet 3I ATLAS. The signal was detected by astronomers at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Bangalore.</p>

<p>This breakthrough is significant as it settles long-standing debates regarding the composition and behavior of comets. Authorities are now focusing on further analysis of the signal to enhance understanding of cometary science and its implications for future explorations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of signal detection: November 16, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of detection: Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore</li>
    <li>Comet: 3I ATLAS</li>
    <li>Significance: First radio signal received from a comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Scientists first identified comet 3I ATLAS in 2023. Research teams have monitored its trajectory and physical characteristics since then.</p>
<p>On November 16, 2025, the Indian Institute of Astrophysics successfully captured a radio signal from the comet, marking a milestone in astronomical research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This signal provides new insights into the composition of comets and their behavior as they approach the Sun,” said Dr. Anil Kumar, lead researcher at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, there have been several attempts to detect radio signals from comets, but none had yielded results. The success with 3I ATLAS may pave the way for new methods in studying these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further analyses of the signal and its implications for understanding cometary processes, with results expected in the coming months.</p>
