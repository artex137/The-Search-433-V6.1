      <h2>3I/ATLAS: The Mysterious Interstellar Comet Spotted By ISRO Scientists From Mount Abu</h2>

<p>Indian scientists have observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) using their 1.2-metre telescope at Mount Abu between November 12 and 15, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported from this event.</p>

<p>This observation marks the third known interstellar comet to enter our solar system. The data collected is crucial as the comet is on a hyperbolic path and will never return. Scientists have gained insights into the comet's structure and composition, which may enhance understanding of materials formed outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations took place from November 12 to 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>The telescope is located at an altitude of 1,680 metres near Gurushikhar.</li>
    <li>The comet's ice is estimated to be 3,500 years old.</li>
    <li>Data collected includes imaging and spectroscopic modes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS survey discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. The PRL team conducted observations between November 12 and 15, 2025, using imaging and spectroscopic techniques to gather detailed data on the comet’s characteristics.</p>

<p>During this period, scientists captured images showing a bright coma around the comet, which forms through sublimation. They also recorded the comet's dust tail and ion tail, which are significant features of its activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This observation has added valuable knowledge about interstellar objects and their characteristics,” said a spokesperson from ISRO.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar comets had been identified, making this observation significant in the field of astronomy. The study of such comets provides insights into the composition of celestial bodies formed beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyse the data collected to better understand the chemical makeup and activity of comet 3I/ATLAS, contributing to ongoing studies of interstellar objects.</p>
