      <h2>3I/ATLAS Updates: How the Hera Space Probe Fits into the Buzz Surrounding the Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency's (ESA) Hera mission has gained attention as the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS passes through the inner Solar System. Launched on 7 October 2024, Hera is tasked with validating humanity's ability to deflect celestial threats, particularly as scientists debate the nature and behavior of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>This mission is significant as it represents the next phase of planetary defense. Hera will analyze kinetic impact techniques that might be necessary to intercept unpredictable celestial visitors like 3I/ATLAS. The findings from this mission could be crucial for future planetary defense strategies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hera launched on 7 October 2024.</li>
    <li>Hera's rendezvous with Dimorphos is scheduled for December 2026.</li>
    <li>The DART spacecraft impacted Dimorphos on 26 September 2022.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS exhibits non-gravitational acceleration, raising questions about its nature.</li>
    <li>Recent studies suggest 3I/ATLAS may be similar to Trans-Neptunian Objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 26 September 2022, NASA's DART spacecraft successfully struck the asteroid Dimorphos, providing a test case for kinetic impactor methods. Following this, the Hera spacecraft was launched on 7 October 2024, with a mission to investigate the aftermath of the DART impact. Currently, Hera is en route to Dimorphos, set to arrive in December 2026.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS traverses the inner Solar System, astronomers have observed behaviors that challenge existing cometary models. These observations have prompted discussions about potential artificial propulsion systems, as noted by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We were all surprised,” said Josep Trigo-Rodriguez, lead researcher at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, regarding the similarities between 3I/ATLAS and Trans-Neptunian Objects. “Being a comet formed in a remote planetary system, it is remarkable that the mixture of materials forming the surface of the body has resemblance with trans-Neptunian objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS has sparked a renewed focus on planetary defense strategies, particularly the role of missions like Hera. The intersection of Hera's technology and the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS highlights the need for advanced systems capable of navigating and responding to deep space challenges.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the Hera spacecraft continues its journey, researchers will analyze data collected from its mission. The findings are expected to inform future planetary defense strategies, particularly in relation to objects like 3I/ATLAS that may pose a threat to Earth.</p>
