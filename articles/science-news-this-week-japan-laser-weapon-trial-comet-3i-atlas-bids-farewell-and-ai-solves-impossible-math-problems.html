      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Bids Farewell as It Leaves Solar System</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed its closest point to Earth and is now on a trajectory to exit our solar system, according to reports on December 20, 2025. The comet, which has captivated astronomers and skywatchers since its discovery in July, is now traveling at a speed of 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</p>

<p>This event is significant for the scientific community as it marks the end of a remarkable journey for 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited unique features such as brightening, color changes, and ice volcanic eruptions. Scientists are now planning to observe the comet until it leaves the solar system, which is expected to occur after it passes Pluto in 2029.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached its closest point to Earth in December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately several miles wide and is 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>It is traveling at a speed of 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to leave the solar system after passing Pluto in 2029.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered.</p>
<p>December 2025: The comet passes its closest point to Earth and begins its departure from the solar system.</p>
<p>2029: 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass Pluto as it continues on its path out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS has dazzled astronomers and skywatchers alike as it zoomed behind our sun,” stated a representative from the scientific community.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We hope to gather more data about the comet’s origins and behavior before it leaves,” said an astronomer involved in the observation efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has sparked interest due to its unique characteristics and the speculation surrounding its potential alien origins. This comet is one of the few interstellar objects to be observed in detail as it travels through our solar system.</p>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, other comets have also generated significant interest, but this particular comet's behavior has been notably unusual, leading to increased scientific scrutiny.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS until it exits the solar system. Observations will focus on understanding the comet's formation and the implications for our knowledge of celestial bodies.</p>
