      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS surprises astronomers again: Mysterious cosmic visitor extends strange tendril</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has surprised astronomers with new observations revealing a sunward-facing plume, or "anti-tail," that points back toward the Sun. The comet is currently hidden behind the Sun and cannot be observed by Earth-based telescopes. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This unusual phenomenon challenges established models of dust and gas behavior in the vicinity of the Sun. Astronomers are analyzing data from multiple observatories to understand the implications of this unexpected feature on cometary dynamics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently hidden behind the Sun.</li>
    <li>A sunward-facing plume has been observed, an uncommon feature for comets.</li>
    <li>Data was collected from several observatories, which flagged the anomaly.</li>
    <li>The comet's tail has shown a sudden transformation, defying typical patterns.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, has raised concerns about the comet potentially being alien technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Multiple teams of astronomers first detected the unusual structure of comet 3I/ATLAS through images taken over consecutive nights. Survey telescopes flagged the anomaly, prompting follow-up observations. Subsequent imaging revealed the pronounced sunward-directed plume, allowing scientists to measure its characteristics.</p>

<p>As data continues to arrive, astronomers have narrowed down possible explanations for the comet's behavior, indicating that further study is necessary.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “You often assume the dating partner would be very friendly, but you have to worry about serial killers, as well.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets typically display two tails: a diffuse dust tail and a straight ion tail. Both are pushed away from the Sun, making the sunward-facing plume of 3I/ATLAS an anomaly. Previous observations of comets have not revealed such persistent features, emphasizing the rarity of this phenomenon.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to analyze new images and spectra to refine their understanding of comet 3I/ATLAS and its unusual behavior. Further observations will help clarify the physical processes at play and may offer insights into the dynamics of comets in general.</p>
