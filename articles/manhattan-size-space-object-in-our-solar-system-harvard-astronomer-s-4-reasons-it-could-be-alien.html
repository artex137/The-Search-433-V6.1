      <h2>Manhattan-size space object in our solar system: Harvard astronomer’s 4 reasons it could be alien</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, has raised questions about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traveling through our solar system. Loeb discussed his theories regarding the object on a recent episode of “The Glenn Beck Program.” He has suggested that 3I/ATLAS may not be an ordinary comet, citing several unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>This discussion comes as scientists continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to pass millions of miles away from Earth. While authorities have assessed the object as posing no threat, Loeb argues that its unique features warrant further examination. His claims could influence ongoing research into interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Roughly the size of Manhattan</li>
    <li><strong>Mass Comparison:</strong> A million times more massive than 'Oumuamua; a thousand times more massive than 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Trajectory:</strong> Aligned to within five degrees with the ecliptic plane of the planets</li>
    <li><strong>Passing Proximity:</strong> Will miss Earth by millions of miles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been tracked as it travels through the solar system. Loeb's observations were shared during a recent episode of “The Glenn Beck Program.” The object’s unusual characteristics have been noted, with Loeb presenting his theories on why it might have extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<p>Loeb has outlined four main reasons that raise his suspicions about the object’s nature, focusing on its size, light emission patterns, trajectory, and timing of its passage.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is not enough rocky material in interstellar space to supply such a giant one once per decade to the inner solar system. We would expect it once per 10,000 years or so,” said Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The trajectory of [3I/ATLAS] is aligned to within five degrees with the ecliptic plane of the planets around the sun,” Loeb explained, emphasizing its unusual path.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That's another coincidence that might indicate fine-tuning,” he added, referring to its timing as it approaches Mars, Venus, and Jupiter.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's claims come amid ongoing interest in interstellar objects, particularly after the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These objects have spurred discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial life and the characteristics of objects entering our solar system.</p>

<p>Experts have generally attributed the unusual traits of 3I/ATLAS to random chance, but Loeb's theories suggest a deeper investigation could be warranted.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further monitoring of 3I/ATLAS is expected as it continues its journey through the solar system. Researchers will likely analyze its characteristics and trajectory to better understand its origins and implications for future studies of interstellar objects.</p>
