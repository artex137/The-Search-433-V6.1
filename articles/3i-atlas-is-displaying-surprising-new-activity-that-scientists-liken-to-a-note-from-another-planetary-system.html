      <h2>3I/ATLAS is Displaying Surprising New Activity That Scientists Liken to "a Note from Another Planetary System"</h2>

<p>Physicists have detected water activity from comet 3I/ATLAS, marking the first observation of hydroxyl gas, a chemical signature of water, from the interstellar object. The detection occurred using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, with observations taking place nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth at a distance of 2.90 astronomical units.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that the basic ingredients for life are not exclusive to our solar system. Authorities are currently analyzing the implications of this finding, as water production from 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into the formation of planetary systems across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is releasing water at a rate of approximately <strong>40 kilograms per second</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet is located <strong>2.90 astronomical units</strong> from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It was discovered on <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Previous studies indicate a nucleus diameter of at least <strong>five kilometers</strong> and a mass of at least <strong>33 billion tons</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory will bring it within <strong>1.4 astronomical units</strong> of the Sun on <strong>October 30, 2026</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of <strong>130,000 miles per hour</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Observations conducted between late July and mid-August 2025 revealed a significant increase in water production from the comet. The research team utilized NASA's Swift telescope to detect water molecules, which is capable of observing ultraviolet light beyond Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>As scientists continue to study 3I/ATLAS, they have noted its unique characteristics, including its massive size and remarkable orbital stability despite significant outgassing activity. The comet's close approach to Mars in late 2025 provided additional imaging opportunities, enhancing the understanding of this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we detect water—or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH—from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, professor of physics at Auburn University and principal investigator of the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise. ‘Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn’t expect it,” noted lead researcher Zexi Xing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS differs significantly from previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. While ‘Oumuamua was found to be dry and Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, 3I/ATLAS showcases water activity at a distance not previously observed for comets. This finding challenges existing theories about the formation and composition of comets and planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS will become observable again after mid-November 2025, allowing astronomers to continue tracking its evolution as it approaches perihelion. Scientists will further investigate the implications of its water activity for understanding the chemistry of life in the universe.</p>
