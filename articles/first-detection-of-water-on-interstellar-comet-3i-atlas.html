      <h2>First Detection of Water on Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A small fragment of ice and dust, designated 3I/ATLAS, has entered the solar system, marking the first detection of hydroxyl (OH) gas from an interstellar comet. Researchers at Auburn University made this discovery using NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The finding was reported in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it provides insights into the behavior and transformation of interstellar comets. The presence of water, indicated by the hydroxyl gas, allows astronomers to compare 3I/ATLAS with comets formed within our solar system. This understanding may help scientists learn more about the formation of planetary systems across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet observed.</li>
    <li>The hydroxyl gas was detected nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet is losing water at a rate of approximately 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The discovery was enabled by NASA's Swift Observatory, which can detect ultraviolet wavelengths.</li>
    <li>The findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered recently as it journeyed through interstellar space. Researchers quickly utilized the Swift Observatory to study the comet before it became too faint or too close to the Sun for observation. The hydroxyl detection occurred when the comet was at a significant distance, suggesting unexpected water activity.</p>

<p>As the comet has now dimmed and is currently beyond visibility, it is expected to be observable again after mid-November, allowing further monitoring of its activity as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “When we detect water—or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH—from an interstellar comet, we're reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, a professor of physics at Auburn.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise. 'Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn't expect it,” remarked Zexi Xing, a postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets has revealed varying chemical compositions across different planetary systems. Previous findings have shown that the ingredients forming comets can differ dramatically, providing insights into how these materials coalesce into planets and the conditions that may support life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to monitor 3I/ATLAS when it becomes visible again after mid-November to observe changes in its activity as it approaches the Sun.</p>
