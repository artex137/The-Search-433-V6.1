      <h2>Eerie footage shows 'UFO' flying above active volcano before vanishing</h2>

<p>Footage of a suspected UFO hovering above the Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico has left alien enthusiasts puzzled. The video, captured on Thursday, October 30, shows a glowing object floating over the volcano's crater before it suddenly disappears at high speed. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The sighting has raised questions among authorities and the public. The National Center for Disaster Prevention has reported multiple eruptions at the volcano, prompting officials to remind the public to respect the exclusion zone around the site.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: October 30, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Popocatepetl volcano, Puebla and Morelos, Mexico</li>
    <li>Altitude of volcano: 5,426 metres (17,802 feet)</li>
    <li>Number of eruptions reported on the day: 19</li>
    <li>Exclusion zone around the crater: 12 kilometres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2023, monitoring cameras at Popocatepetl captured a glowing object above the volcano. The object was seen hovering over the crater as smoke and flames erupted from it. Shortly after, the UFO flew off at high speed. The National Center for Disaster Prevention later reported 19 low-intensity eruptions from the volcano that day.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The authorities have not issued a statement on the origin of the mysterious flying object,”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We call on the public to stay away from the crater and respect the 12-kilometre exclusion zone,”</blockquote> 
<blockquote>“No man-made object could enter the crater as temperatures reach around 1,000 degrees Celsius,”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The University of Bergen in Norway discovered that under the volcano there are magnetic storms necessary to be able to generate X-points,”</blockquote> 
<blockquote>“X-points are places where the magnetic field of Earth connects to the magnetic field of the Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting follows claims made by UFO expert Jaime Maussan, who suggested that Popocatepetl acts as an "inter-dimensional portal." Maussan argued that magnetic storms beneath the volcano could create pathways for intergalactic travel.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for further investigations regarding the UFO sighting. Public safety measures remain in effect as the volcano continues to exhibit activity.</p>
