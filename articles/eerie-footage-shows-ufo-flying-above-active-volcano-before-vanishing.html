      <h2>Eerie footage shows 'UFO' flying above active volcano before vanishing</h2>

<p>Footage of a suspected UFO hovering over the Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico has emerged, sparking intrigue among UFO enthusiasts. The video, recorded by a webcam, shows a glowing object floating above the volcano's crater before it abruptly accelerates and disappears. This incident occurred on Thursday, October 30, as the volcano was actively erupting.</p>

<p>Authorities have not yet commented on the origin of the unidentified object. The National Center for Disaster Prevention has reported multiple low-intensity eruptions from the volcano and has urged the public to maintain a safe distance from the area, which has a 12-kilometer exclusion zone.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: October 30, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Popocatepetl volcano, Puebla and Morelos, Mexico</li>
    <li>Altitude of the volcano: 5,426 meters (17,802 feet)</li>
    <li>Reported eruptions: 19 low-intensity eruptions on the same day</li>
    <li>Exclusion zone: 12 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2023, a webcam recorded a glowing object hovering above the crater of Popocatepetl volcano. As smoke and flames erupted from the volcano, the object zoomed off at high speeds. The National Center for Disaster Prevention reported 19 low-intensity eruptions that day.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The public should keep their distance from the crater and respect the 12-kilometer exclusion zone,” said a spokesperson from the National Center for Disaster Prevention.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Popocatepetl is one of Mexico's most active volcanoes and has a history of eruptions. Last year, UFO expert Jaime Maussan suggested that the volcano acts as an "inter-dimensional portal," allowing intergalactic travelers to access different locations. He noted that temperatures within the crater reach approximately 1,000 degrees Celsius, making man-made objects unlikely to enter.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to monitor the volcano and its activity, while investigations into the unidentified object are ongoing. No further comments have been made regarding potential explanations for the sighting.</p>
