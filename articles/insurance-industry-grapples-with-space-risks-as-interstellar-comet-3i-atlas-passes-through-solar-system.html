      <h2>Insurance Industry Grapples With Space Risks as Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Passes Through Solar System</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, has prompted the insurance industry to reassess its risk models related to cosmic events. The comet poses no direct threat to Earth, remaining approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles or 270 million kilometers) away at its closest approach.</p>

<p>The passage of 3I/ATLAS through the solar system highlights the increasing complexity of space-related risks, particularly as the insurance sector prepares for a strong solar maximum in 2025, which could lead to more satellite failures. Insurers are under pressure to develop comprehensive frameworks to address these emerging risks.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun expected on October 30, 2025, at about 1.4 AU.</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach will be approximately 1.8 AU.</li>
    <li>Significant market stress reported in the insurance industry.</li>
    <li>About half of new satellite launches are currently insured, down from historical levels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the European Space Agency (ESA) detected the comet using automated systems. Following the discovery, ESA astronomers began monitoring 3I/ATLAS with ground-based telescopes in Hawaii, Chile, and Australia. NASA confirmed the comet's trajectory and risk level in a statement on July 3, 2025, ruling out any threat to Earth.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches its closest point to the Sun, discussions within the insurance sector have intensified regarding coverage for space-related risks, particularly in light of the upcoming solar maximum.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA’s official assessment provides the most authoritative source on 3I/ATLAS’s trajectory and risk level,” said a NASA representative regarding the comet's passage. “We categorically rule out any Earth impact threat.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Denis Bousquet, an executive in AXA XL’s space business, noted, “About half of new satellite launches now have insurance, down from historical levels as premiums rise and coverage becomes more restrictive.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The appearance of 3I/ATLAS marks only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. As space debris becomes an increasingly pressing issue, the insurance industry has begun incorporating clauses related to space debris mitigation, collision avoidance protocols, and end-of-life disposal plans into policies. This evolution aims to address the complexities of space insurance as threats diversify.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The insurance industry will continue to evolve its risk assessment strategies in light of 3I/ATLAS and the upcoming solar maximum, while monitoring the comet's trajectory and potential impacts on satellite infrastructure. Further assessments and policy updates are anticipated as the industry adapts to changing cosmic risks.</p>
