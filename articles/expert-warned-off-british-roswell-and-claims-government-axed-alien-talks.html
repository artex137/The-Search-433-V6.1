      <h2>UFO expert claims government has cancelled talks on alien encounters</h2>

<p>Mark Christopher Lee, a UFO expert and filmmaker, has claimed that the UK government has cancelled planned discussions regarding alien encounters and has warned him against speaking about a significant incident known as the “British Roswell” in Rendlesham, Suffolk.

<p>This situation raises questions about government transparency on UFO sightings and potential encounters.

He remains determined to pursue the truth despite these challenges.</p>
