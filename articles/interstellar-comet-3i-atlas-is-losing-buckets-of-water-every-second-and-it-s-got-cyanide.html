      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Releases Water and Cyanide as It Travels Through the Solar System</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar visitor, has been observed releasing approximately 40 kilograms of water every second as it moves through the Solar System. This finding was reported by researchers using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, which has focused on studying the comet in ultraviolet light. The comet is currently not visible from Earth, as it is on the opposite side of the Sun.</p>

<p>The study of Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant because it provides insights into the conditions of its formation and the potential for prebiotic chemistry in space. The presence of hydrogen cyanide, a common molecule found in gas clouds, has also been detected. Researchers believe that this comet may be several billion years older than the Solar System, originating from the thick disk of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS releases about 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of water per second.</li>
    <li>An Olympic-sized pool's worth of water is lost every 18 hours.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently not visible from Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory is studying the comet in ultraviolet light.</li>
    <li>The detection of hydroxyl (OH) gas indicates the presence of water.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS may originate from the thick disk of the Milky Way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been the subject of study as it travels through the Solar System. Recent observations have revealed its unusual composition, including a higher ratio of nickel to iron compared to other comets.</p>
<p>In July and August 2023, the comet was monitored in both visible and ultraviolet light, leading to the detection of hydroxyl gas, which indicates water presence.</p>
<p>As of now, the comet is not visible from Earth, but it will be observed by the Jupiter-bound mission JUICE in the near future.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we detect water—or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH—from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, professor of physics at Auburn University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” added Zexi Xing, postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the new study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS joins two previous interstellar objects, Comet 1I/’Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, both of which have provided valuable data about the nature of comets from outside our Solar System. The discovery of water and other compounds in interstellar comets may reshape our understanding of the chemical processes that lead to the formation of planets and life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, expecting increased cometary activity. Future observations will be conducted by various space missions, including JUICE, to gather more data on this intriguing interstellar object.</p>
