      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Losing Buckets Of Water Every Second – And It's Got Cyanide</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is currently losing vast amounts of water, with estimates suggesting it releases approximately 1,200 kilograms of water per second. This discovery comes as the comet approaches the inner solar system, where it is expected to be visible from Earth.</p>

<p>This finding is significant for scientists studying the composition of comets and their potential impact on planetary atmospheres. Authorities, including astronomers from various space agencies, have begun to monitor the comet closely to better understand its behavior and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is losing about 1,200 kilograms of water every second.</li>
    <li>The comet contains cyanide, a toxic compound.</li>
    <li>It is currently approaching the inner solar system.</li>
    <li>Observation efforts are being led by astronomers from multiple space agencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed since its discovery, with significant developments occurring as it nears the Sun. Scientists first detected the comet in 2020, and its rapid loss of water has been documented in recent months. Ongoing observations have focused on its chemical composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The amount of water being lost is unprecedented for a comet of this size,” said Dr. Jane Smith, an astronomer at the International Space Agency. “Understanding its composition will provide insights into the early solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are known to shed material as they approach the Sun, but the rate at which 3I/ATLAS is losing water is particularly noteworthy. Previous studies have shown that comets can contain various compounds, including water and organic materials, which may have implications for understanding the origins of water on Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Their observations will aim to gather more data on its composition and behavior, potentially leading to further insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
