      <h2>Is this the real image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS?</h2>

<p>A viral post claiming to show the first realistic image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked interest worldwide. The image, allegedly released by Japan’s space agency, has circulated on social media since it was shared on the platform X (formerly Twitter) on <strong>October 15, 2023</strong>. No official confirmation has been made by NASA or the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).</p>

<p>The image purportedly depicts the comet based on spectral and imaging data analysis, but experts have cautioned that its authenticity remains unverified. This incident has reignited discussions among astronomers and space enthusiasts regarding the comet’s origin, composition, and visibility from Earth. Authorities are reviewing the implications of the image and the growing global interest in interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>, by NASA's ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet moves at speeds exceeding <strong>210,000 kilometres per hour</strong>.</li>
    <li>It passed closest to the Sun on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>, in an event known as perihelion.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's ATLAS telescope detected comet 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025. The discovery marked the identification of a rare interstellar object, confirmed by NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) as having a trajectory that did not originate within our solar system. The comet passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025, before continuing its journey outward through the solar system.</p>

<p>On October 15, 2023, a user on the platform X shared an image claiming to be a realistic depiction of 3I/ATLAS, igniting discussions in the scientific community and among the public. Despite the lack of official confirmation, the image has captured the attention of astronomy enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The image has not been officially validated by NASA or JAXA, but it has certainly generated excitement and curiosity,” said an unnamed expert in astronomy.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks NASA's confirmation of a rare interstellar comet. Previously, only two other interstellar objects have been identified, making 3I/ATLAS a noteworthy addition to astronomical studies. The ongoing interest in such celestial phenomena reflects a broader trend in space science, focusing on the exploration of objects that originate from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating the authenticity of the image. If verified, it could provide one of the most detailed renderings of an interstellar object to date, further enhancing scientific understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>
