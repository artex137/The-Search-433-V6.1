      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows comet tail in new image</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured live images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from the Gemini South telescope in Chile during an outreach program on August 27, 2025. The images show the comet's tail and coma, indicating increased activity as it travels through the inner solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant because it provides insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar comets, which are rare. The data collected may enhance understanding of planetary system formation. The event was part of the Shadow the Scientists program, which connects the public with scientific research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: August 27, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Gemini South telescope, Cerro Pachón, Chile</li>
    <li>Program: Shadow the Scientists, organized by NSF NOIRLab</li>
    <li>Scientific leaders: Karen Meech (University of Hawai‘i) and Bin Yang (Universidad Diego Portales)</li>
    <li>First detected: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar comets: 1I/’Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet was observed on August 27, 2025, using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph as part of a public outreach initiative. During the session, participants interacted with scientists and observed the comet in real-time.</p>

<p>Images captured during the observation revealed a broad coma and a tail, suggesting that the comet has become more active as it approaches the sun. This activity is significant for understanding the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"The primary objectives of the observations were to look at the colors of the comet, which provide clues to the composition and sizes of the dust particles in the coma, and to take spectra for a direct measure of the chemistry," said Karen Meech.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Every interstellar comet is a messenger from another star system, and by studying their light and color, we can begin to understand the diversity of worlds beyond our own," added Bryce Bolin.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are exceptionally rare; 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed case following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike regular comets that orbit the sun, 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory that will take it back into interstellar space.</p>

<p>The observations build on NOIRLab’s efforts to combine scientific research with public engagement, allowing the public to participate in real scientific experiments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In November 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS will reemerge from behind the sun. A follow-up observing session will be hosted by Bryce Bolin at the Gemini North telescope in Hawai‘i, inviting the public to engage once again with the scientific community.</p>
