      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-14 17:56 UTC</p>

      <h2>University of Hawaii Observes Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>The University of Hawaii has conducted spectrophotometric observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph on its 2.2-m telescope. These observations began approximately 12.5 hours after the comet's discovery announcement in December 2025.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it allows scientists to study the properties of a small body from another solar system and compare it with similar bodies in our own solar system. The data collected includes the earliest wavelengths lower than 3800 Ångströms and confirms the comet's activity, including emissions of nickel (Ni) and cyanogen (CN).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations began approximately 12.5 hours after the discovery announcement.</li>
    <li>Research was conducted using the University of Hawaii's 2.2-m telescope.</li>
    <li>Wavelength range of observations includes λ≤3800 Å.</li>
    <li>Pre-perihelion distance of 3I/ATLAS ranged from 4.4 to 2.5 astronomical units (au).</li>
    <li>Color evolution during observations showed g−r colors from ∼0.69-0.75 mag.</li>
    <li>Research team includes W. B. Hoogendam, D. Kuesters, and others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 9, 2025, the discovery of comet 3I/ATLAS was announced. Following this, the University of Hawaii initiated observations using its 2.2-m telescope. The first spectral data was collected approximately 12.5 hours post-discovery. Subsequent observations confirmed cometary activity, identifying emissions of nickel and cyanogen.</p>

<p>The observations tracked the comet's approach to perihelion, with varying spectral slopes observed throughout the pre-perihelion phase. The research team has indicated that ongoing observations will continue to provide insights into the comet's composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The discovery of 3I/ATLAS provides an opportunity to explore the properties of a small body from another solar system,” said W. B. Hoogendam, a member of the research team.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, offering researchers a unique chance to study materials that may differ from those found in our own solar system. Prior observations of interstellar objects have contributed to a better understanding of the formation of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing post-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS are expected to yield further insights into its composition and behavior as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>
