      <h2>Rare Comet Older Than the Sun Seen by Mars Orbiters</h2>

<p>ESA’s Mars orbiters have captured images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed close to Mars between October 1 and October 7, 2025. The comet, believed to be older than the Sun, displayed a bright, hazy coma during its closest approach on October 3, approximately 48 kilometres from the planet's surface. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The observations from ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express spacecraft are significant as they provide insights into the composition and characteristics of a rare interstellar object. Researchers are now analyzing the data to better understand the comet’s origins and its implications for solar system formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed Mars between October 1 and October 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach occurred on October 3, at a distance of approximately 48 km.</li>
    <li>ESA’s ExoMars TGO and Mars Express conducted observations.</li>
    <li>The comet is believed to predate the formation of the Sun.</li>
    <li>Images reveal a bright, hazy coma surrounding the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between October 1 and October 7, 2025, ESA’s Mars orbiters were positioned to observe interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The closest approach occurred on October 3, allowing the spacecraft to capture detailed images of the comet’s coma.</p>
<p>These observations occurred as part of a planned investigation to study the comet's features and gather data on its composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This close pass of 3I/ATLAS provides a unique opportunity to study an object that has traveled from beyond our solar system,” said a spokesperson for the European Space Agency (ESA).</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare occurrences, and 3I/ATLAS is one of the few observed since the discovery of 1I/2017 U1, the first confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system. The study of such comets can enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from the ESA orbiters to gain further insights into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. The findings may contribute to broader studies on the origins of comets and their role in the solar system's development.</p>
