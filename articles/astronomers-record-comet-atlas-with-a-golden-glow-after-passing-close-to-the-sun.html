      <h2>Astronomers record comet ATLAS with a golden glow after passing close to the Sun</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) returning with a golden hue after its closest approach to the Sun on October 8, 2025. The comet reached a minimum distance of 50 million kilometers from the Sun, where experts had anticipated a high probability of disintegration due to heat and solar gravity.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks a rare event in which the comet has not only survived but also brightened, displaying a long tail shaped by the solar wind. The ATLAS system, which discovered the comet in May 2025, continues to monitor its trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 8, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum distance from the Sun:</strong> 50 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Current apparent magnitude:</strong> 9</li>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach to Earth:</strong> November 25, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility period:</strong> Until early December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation locations:</strong> Hawaii, Chile, South Africa, California, Arizona</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered by the ATLAS system in May 2025. It remained largely inconspicuous until its perihelion, when it made its closest approach to the Sun on October 8, 2025.</p>
<p>Following this event, the comet exhibited a rare golden hue and a long tail, with observations confirming its brightness and unusual chemical composition. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on November 25, 2025, and will remain visible until early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The intense heating released particles that reflect sunlight at specific wavelengths, contributing to the comet's unique coloration,” said David Schleicher of Lowell Observatory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The golden and reddish hue differentiates C/2025 K1 from common comets,” added Schleicher, mentioning its low concentration of carbon molecules.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ATLAS system has been instrumental in monitoring celestial objects, especially those that may pose risks of disintegration. Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is notable for its survival against high odds, with its proximity to the Sun being four times smaller than that of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>Previous observations have shown that comets often display a range of colors based on their chemical compositions, with typical green or bluish tones resulting from higher carbon content.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Professional observatories will continue to monitor the daily evolution of C/2025 K1’s coma and core. This ongoing observation aims to better understand the comet's resistance during its solar passage and its potential for continued brightness as it approaches Earth.</p>
