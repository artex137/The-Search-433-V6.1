      <h2>3I/ATLAS' Acceleration Exposed: NASA Tracks Interstellar Comet on Alarming Speed Run Past Earth</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS is currently speeding through the solar system, having reached velocities of up to 152,000 miles per hour (approximately 244,000 kilometers per hour) after its closest approach to the sun on October 29. NASA has described this event as an “alarming speed run.” There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's passage.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its rarity as one of only three known interstellar objects to pass through our solar system. NASA is actively tracking the comet using multiple telescopes to study its composition and behavior, aiming to gather valuable data about its origins and the star system from which it came.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Current speed: 152,000 mph (approximately 244,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Initial speed: 137,000 mph (approximately 220,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: October 29</li>
    <li>Diameter range: 440 meters to 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>NASA's primary tool: Hubble Space Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted traveling at 137,000 mph. Following its closest approach to the sun on October 29, the comet has increased its speed to 152,000 mph due to gravitational forces from the sun.</p>
<p>NASA has mobilized its telescopes to analyze the comet’s composition and behavior, with a focus on studying the light and vapors emitted from 3I/ATLAS. This ongoing research aims to uncover details about the comet's origin and the chemistry of its home star system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This rare comet is providing scientists with a unique, fleeting opportunity to study a true alien artefact,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to be discovered passing through our solar system. Previous interstellar visitors have provided insights into the nature of other star systems, and the study of 3I/ATLAS could enhance our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it speeds away from the sun and Earth, with updates expected as more data is collected. Scientists are eager to analyze the findings to better understand the comet and its origins.</p>
