      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-06 17:54 UTC</p>

      <h2>Nasa Activates Planetary Defense by Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense protocol for comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object with an unstable trajectory and unusual brightness, as of December 6, 2025. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, near the orbit of Mars, at a distance of about 210 million kilometers from the Sun. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this activation.</p>

<p>This activation underscores the scientific community's increasing focus on atypical celestial objects. Authorities are collaborating internationally to enhance tracking and analysis capabilities for 3I/ATLAS, which exhibits significant variations in its trajectory and brightness. Although the comet does not pose an immediate threat to Earth, this event serves as a crucial test of global systems designed to monitor potential space threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has a speed exceeding <strong>210,000 km/h</strong>.</li>
    <li>Initial detection occurred approximately <strong>450 million kilometers</strong> from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>Comet’s core diameter is estimated between <strong>320 meters</strong> and <strong>5.6 kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>NASA's planetary defense activation is part of a broader international effort.</li>
    <li>Observation exercises will continue from <strong>November 27, 2025</strong> to <strong>January 27, 2026</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The activation of the planetary defense protocol follows a series of observations that detected irregularities in the comet's behavior:</p>
<ul>
    <li>October 30, 2025: The comet reaches perihelion near Mars.</li>
    <li>November 10, 2025: A workshop is held to adapt algorithms for tracking hyperbolic trajectories.</li>
    <li>November 27, 2025: Intensive observation exercises commence, focusing on comet 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activation does not indicate an emergency but reinforces our observation and analysis capabilities for unusual celestial objects,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet, and its hyperbolic trajectory differentiates it from comets originating within our solar system. Previous incidents with irregular celestial objects have prompted advancements in tracking technologies and international cooperation in space monitoring.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its international partners will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS closely, improving tracking techniques and preparing for potential future anomalies. Ongoing observation exercises aim to compile a comprehensive dataset to enhance understanding of the comet's behavior.</p>
