      <h2>NASA reveals four crucial discoveries about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in press conference</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a natural origin and shows no signs of extraterrestrial technology during a press conference held last week. The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, and is the third confirmed interstellar visitor.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it eliminates speculation about a possible alien spacecraft that has circulated on social media. NASA has organized a coordinated campaign involving more than 20 space missions, which has provided the most complete picture of the comet to date. Ongoing analyses and new observations are expected in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 427 meters to 5.6 kilometers in size.</li>
    <li>The comet maintains a minimum distance of 270 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
    <li>Its trajectory predicts passage through Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.</li>
    <li>The campaign involved over 20 missions, including those orbiting Mars.</li>
    <li>The initial discovery occurred when the comet was on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA's analysis indicates the comet formed in an intense radiation environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. NASA organized a joint action in August 2025 to overcome initial observation difficulties. The SOHO observatory identified the object in October 2025, despite its expected low luminosity. Various missions contributed to the analysis, with significant observations made from September to October 2025.</p>

<p>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured the comet from 145 million kilometers away, while the MAVEN mission detected ultraviolet signals from hydrogen 32 million kilometers away. The Lucy probe assisted in 3D modeling by observing the coma and tail in the opposite direction.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, NASA Associate Administrator, stated, "The object exhibits typical comet appearance and behavior."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nicky Fox, from the Directorate of Scientific Missions, emphasized, "No instrument detected a technological signature."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following previous discoveries that have expanded scientific understanding of objects beyond the solar system. The campaign to study 3I/ATLAS showcases NASA's ability to mobilize resources quickly in response to rare astronomical events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing analyses of the comet are in their initial phase, with new observations scheduled for the coming months. NASA continues to monitor the comet as it travels out of the solar system following perihelion.</p>
