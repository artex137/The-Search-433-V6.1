      <h2>3I/ATLAS An Alien Craft? Prof Michio Kaku Says Interstellar Object May Be Extraterritorial Visitors</h2>

<p>Professor Michio Kaku has discussed the potential implications of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object to enter our solar system, during a recent interview. The comet, traveling at approximately 209,000 kilometres per hour, is expected to approach the Sun on October 30, 2025, making it difficult to track thereafter. Kaku's comments have sparked interest among both scientists and the public regarding the nature of this object.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unusual characteristics and trajectory. While some experts, like Professor Avi Loeb, speculate that the comet may be a sign of extraterrestrial intelligence, NASA maintains a more cautious stance. Kaku has noted that observations of the comet during its flyby could yield crucial data, particularly if it exhibits an unexpected boost in energy, which he claims could indicate intelligent guidance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 209,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Expected flyby date: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Significance: Possible indicators of extraterrestrial intelligence</li>
    <li>Key figures: Professor Michio Kaku, Professor Avi Loeb</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been identified as an interstellar object, marking its entry into the solar system. As of October 26, 2025, Kaku has discussed the object’s potential implications in various media appearances.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2025, the comet is scheduled to make its closest approach to the Sun, which is expected to provide critical observational opportunities for scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it picks up extra energy on its flyby, that would clinch it. That means there’s extraterrestrial intelligence involved.” - Professor Michio Kaku</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If it’s not a giant rock and it could be a sign of life out there, something’s gotta be steering it, right?” - Professor Michio Kaku</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, other interstellar visitors, including 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua), have prompted discussions regarding the possibility of extraterrestrial life. These incidents have led to increased interest in the study of interstellar objects and their implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, researchers will monitor its trajectory and energy levels closely. Observations during the flyby will help determine whether the comet exhibits any unexpected behaviour, which could provide further insight into its origins.</p>
