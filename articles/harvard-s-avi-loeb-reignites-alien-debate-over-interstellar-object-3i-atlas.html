      <h2>Harvard’s Avi Loeb reignites alien debate over interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Dr. Avi Loeb has revived discussions about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is approaching Earth, suggesting it could be a "Trojan Horse" that disguises a technological object as a comet. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the object as it travels through space.</p>

<p>This discussion is significant as it touches on the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the nature of interstellar objects. Authorities and experts are closely monitoring the situation, with new observations expected soon from a spacecraft heading toward Jupiter. These findings may further inform the debate on the origin of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Dr. Loeb claims there is a 30 to 40 percent chance the object is not of natural origin.</li>
    <li>Observations from a spacecraft en route to Jupiter are expected next month.</li>
    <li>The object will come within 267 kilometers of Earth in December 2023.</li>
    <li>Multi-color images from the Gemini South Observatory in Chile were captured on August 27, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, 3I/ATLAS was discovered, prompting various theories about its nature. On August 27, astronomers captured multi-color images of the object, revealing it to be a comet with a dense icy nucleus and a long tail. In the following months, Dr. Loeb has proposed that it could be an alien spacecraft, while other experts have dismissed these claims. New observations are anticipated next month as the object nears Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have no idea of the amount of traffic of extraterrestrial probes in the vicinity of the Solar system. Given the uncertainty, it would be prudent to collect as much data as possible on interstellar objects from all directions and assess the level of risk based on that data.”</blockquote> — Dr. Avi Loeb

<blockquote>“It’s not a comet.”</blockquote> — Dr. Horace Drew, retired senior researcher at Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO)

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS is not new; previous interstellar objects like ‘Oumuamua have also sparked discussions about the existence of extraterrestrial life. Despite some experts supporting the alien theory, the scientific consensus remains skeptical, with evidence typically pointing to natural origins for such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations will continue as new data from the spacecraft approaching Jupiter is expected next month. The scientific community will analyze this information to further understand the nature of 3I/ATLAS and assess any potential risks it may pose.</p>
