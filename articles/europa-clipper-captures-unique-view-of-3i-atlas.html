      <h2>Europa Clipper Captures Unique View of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Scientists using the Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) instrument aboard NASA’s Europa Clipper spacecraft have observed 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object detected entering the Solar System, on November 6, 2025. The spacecraft captured data from a distance of approximately 164 million km (103 million miles) as it traveled toward Jupiter.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides a unique perspective on the interstellar comet, which was poorly positioned for visibility from Earth- and Mars-based telescopes due to its proximity to the Sun. Authorities at NASA aim to analyze the data collected to gain insights into the comet’s composition and its journey through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 6, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the comet: 164 million km (103 million miles)</li>
    <li>Comet discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Heliocentric distance at discovery: 4.51 astronomical units (AU)</li>
    <li>Eccentricity of the comet: 6.13</li>
    <li>Launch of Europa Clipper: 2024</li>
    <li>Scheduled arrival in the Jovian system: 2030</li>
    <li>Number of planned flybys of Europa: 49</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025. Analysts at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory identified its trajectory shortly after the discovery. The Europa Clipper team realized they could observe the comet in November 2025, bridging the gap between earlier Mars-based views and upcoming Earth-based observations.</p>

<p>During this period, the spacecraft's position allowed it to capture a unique view of the comet’s two tails, providing crucial data that was not available through other observation methods.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re excited that this opportunity to view another target on the way to Jupiter was completely unexpected,” said Europa-UVS principal investigator Dr. Kurt Retherford, a researcher at the Southwest Research Institute.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We’re hopeful that this new view, along with observations from Earth-based assets and other spacecraft, will help us to piece together a more complete understanding of the tails’ geometries,” said Europa-UVS co-deputy principal investigator Dr. Thomas Greathouse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Understanding the composition of the comet and how readily these gases are emitted can give us a clearer view of the comet’s origin and how it may have evolved during transit from elsewhere in the Galaxy to our Solar System,” said Europa-UVS co-deputy principal investigator Dr. Tracy Becker.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected in the Solar System. The ability of the Europa Clipper to observe this comet from a unique perspective adds to the understanding of such interstellar visitors and their characteristics.</p>

<p>Previous observations of interstellar objects have provided insights into their origins and the processes they undergo as they travel through space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to analyze the data collected by the UVS instrument to enhance understanding of the chemical processes at play in 3I/ATLAS. Further studies will aim to unravel the comet’s origin and its evolutionary path through the Galaxy.</p>
