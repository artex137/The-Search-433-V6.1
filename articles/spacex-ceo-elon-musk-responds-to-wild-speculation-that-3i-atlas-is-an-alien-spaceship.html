      <h2>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk Responds To Wild Speculation That 3I/ATLAS Is An Alien Spaceship</h2>

<p>Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, has addressed speculation surrounding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS during an interview on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Musk stated that the object, which was identified as a comet by astronomers, is not an alien spacecraft. The discussion took place on [insert date of podcast], following the comet's discovery by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System on July 1, 2025.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the Solar System, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Scientists are eager to study this comet, which may offer insights into the early universe, having traveled for approximately 10 billion years. However, speculation about its potential alien origins has drawn attention and debate among the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, the closest approach to the Sun, occurred on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object in the Solar System.</li>
    <li>Speculation about the object being an alien spacecraft has been dismissed by NASA and SETI.</li>
    <li>Musk stated he would reveal any evidence of aliens on Rogan's show if he had it.</li>
    <li>Outgassing from the comet is expected to cause changes in its trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System discovered 3I/ATLAS. The object was identified as a comet on an escape trajectory from the Solar System. On October 30, 2025, it reached its perihelion, where it was closest to the Sun.</p>

<p>Following its discovery, speculation arose, particularly from Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who suggested the object could be an alien spacecraft. This claim was made during the comet's approach to perihelion.</p>

<p>In a recent podcast interview, Elon Musk addressed these claims, emphasizing that 3I/ATLAS is a comet and not an alien ship.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “One thing I can say is like, look, if I was aware of any evidence of aliens, Joe, you have my word. I will come on your show and I will reveal it on the show,” Musk told Rogan.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “No, there are definitely comets and asteroids which are primarily made of nickel,” Musk explained regarding the object’s composition.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It would like obliterate a continent type of thing... Probably kill most of human life. If not all of us,” Musk added when discussing the potential impact of the object on Earth.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The speculation around 3I/ATLAS echoes previous discussions surrounding interstellar objects, particularly 1I/'Oumuamua, which also faced theories about alien origins. The scientific community, including organizations like NASA and SETI, has largely advocated for natural explanations over speculative theories regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>As comets approach the Sun, they often undergo physical changes due to heating and outgassing, which can alter their trajectories without suggesting artificial manipulation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System. Ongoing studies aim to analyze its composition and behavior, providing further insights into this ancient interstellar object.</p>
