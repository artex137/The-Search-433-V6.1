      <h2>MAVEN Captures Shocking Deuterium Ratios: What Comet 3I/ATLAS Means For Earth</h2>

<p>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) have successfully captured critical data on comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor, in early October. The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant as it offers insights into the origins of water on Earth. The data gathered may help answer whether Earth's water came from local asteroids or was delivered by comets from deep space. NASA's Mars missions have collaborated to capture high-resolution images and chemical analyses of the comet, providing unprecedented information on its composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object observed by NASA's Mars missions.</li>
    <li>MRO captured images of the comet from a distance of 30 million kilometres on October 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>MAVEN has been analysing the comet's chemistry since September 27, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Data from MAVEN may provide insights into the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio of the comet.</li>
    <li>NASA's Perseverance rover captured images of the comet on October 4, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 27, 2023, MAVEN began its analysis of comet 3I/ATLAS's composition, employing its Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS). Following this, on October 2, MRO captured high-resolution images of the comet from 30 million kilometres away. Finally, on October 4, the Perseverance rover detected the comet from the Martian surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The images MAVEN captured truly are incredible," said Shannon Curry, MAVEN's principal investigator at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. "The detections we are seeing are significant, and we have only scraped the surface of our analysis."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "Observations of interstellar objects are still rare enough that we learn something new on every occasion," said Shane Byrne, HiRISE principal investigator at the University of Arizona. "We're fortunate that 3I/ATLAS passed this close to Mars."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object discovered in our solar system. Previous encounters, such as with comet Siding Spring in 2014, have provided valuable data about the composition of such celestial bodies. The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS reflects a growing interest in understanding the origins of water and other essential elements for life on Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet continues its journey through the solar system, scientists will analyse the data collected to gain further insights into its composition and implications for Earth's water origins. Future studies may expand on the findings from MAVEN and MRO as they continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS.</p>
