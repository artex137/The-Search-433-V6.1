      <h2>Two Long Island Brothers Investigate Mystery Drones</h2>

<p>John and Gerald Tedesco, two Long Island UFO hunters, have been called upon by various law enforcement agencies to investigate a series of unexplained drone sightings along the US East Coast. The investigations began in December 2024, when multiple drones violated restricted airspace at the US Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, located outside Boston. The incident involved a squadron of 15 to 20 unidentified drones, prompting responses from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>This surge in unexplained drone activity has raised significant concerns among military and law enforcement officials. Investigators are seeking answers to the origins and intentions of these drones, which have disrupted airspace over sensitive sites, including military installations and a golf course owned by Donald Trump. The FBI has initiated investigations and issued flight bans in response to the incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: December 2024</li>
    <li>Location: US Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, outside Boston</li>
    <li>Number of drones: 15 to 20</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: FBI, Massachusetts State Police, local law enforcement</li>
    <li>Previous sightings: At least 11 unauthorized incursions over Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey</li>
    <li>Reported drone incursions: Approximately 350 over 100 US military installations in 2024</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2024, law enforcement agencies were dispatched to the US Army Natick Soldier Systems Center after multiple drones were reported violating restricted airspace. This incident coincided with a series of similar sightings along the East Coast, particularly in New Jersey. Local police sought assistance from the FBI and military officials to investigate the unidentified drones.</p>

<p>By late January 2025, the incoming Trump administration characterized the New Jersey drone wave as benign, stating that all drones involved were authorized by the FAA for research purposes. However, military officials, including Air Force General Gregory Guillot, testified to the Senate about the unresolved nature of many drone incursions and potential foreign intelligence involvement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was talking to old ladies who’re telling me that there’s this ship in the ocean that’s launching hundreds of these at a time across the United States,” said Brian Lauzon, deputy chief of Natick’s municipal police department.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“They do look like commercial air traffic for the most part, but they also exhibit unexplained or unusual phenomena,” said John Tedesco during a virtual town hall.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent drone sightings have sparked renewed interest in unidentified aerial phenomena, echoing past incidents that have captured public attention since the late 1940s. The Tedescos, with their specialized equipment and background in electrical engineering, have emerged as key figures in the investigation. Their mobile unit, dubbed “the Nightcrawler,” is equipped to detect a range of signals, enhancing the understanding of these mysterious drones.</p>

<p>Despite the Tedescos' efforts, the lack of clear answers and coordination among authorities has left many questions unanswered. Their collaboration with the Harvard alien-hunting Galileo Project has further legitimized their role in the investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue their investigations into the drone sightings. The FBI and other agencies will likely maintain communications with the Tedescos as they gather more data on the mystery drones. The situation remains fluid, with ongoing assessments of the potential threats posed by these unidentified aircraft.</p>
