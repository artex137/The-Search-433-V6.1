      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been transformed by billions of years of space radiation, James Webb Space Telescope observations reveal</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has undergone significant changes due to billions of years of cosmic radiation, according to a study using observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Researchers have determined that the comet's outer crust has been altered, making it unrecognizable compared to the material from its original star system.</p>

<p>This research, posted on the preprint server arXiv on October 31, highlights the impact of galactic cosmic rays on the comet during its estimated 7-billion-year journey through the Milky Way. The findings suggest that comet 3I/ATLAS is primarily composed of material processed by cosmic radiation, rather than pristine material from its formation environment.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently traveling through our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion, its closest point to the sun, on October 29.</li>
    <li>It is estimated to be over 3 billion years older than the solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at speeds exceeding <strong>130,000 mph</strong> (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. Observations from various telescopes began shortly after its discovery to gather data on its composition and behavior.</p>
<p>The first images of the comet from JWST were released in August, revealing high levels of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) enrichment.</p>
<p>The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2023, marking a significant point in its journey through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It's very slow, but over billions of years, it's a very strong effect,” said Romain Maggiolo, lead author and research scientist at the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We have to be careful and take into account aging processes, so it's more work for scientists, but [3I/ATLAS] remains very interesting,” Maggiolo added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This research builds on previous studies documenting the rich carbon dioxide content of comet 3I/ATLAS, suggesting that its composition is significantly influenced by cosmic ray exposure. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the materials that comets retain from their formation environments.</p>
<p>Previous work on domestic comets, such as comet 67P, has informed the understanding of cosmic ray effects on cometary structures, allowing scientists to adapt those models to interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS after perihelion to compare its composition before and after solar erosion. These observations may provide insights into the comet's initial materials and how it has changed over time.</p>
