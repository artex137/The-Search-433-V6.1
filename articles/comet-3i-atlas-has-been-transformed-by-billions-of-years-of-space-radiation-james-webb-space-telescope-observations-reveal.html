      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been transformed by billions of years of space radiation, James Webb Space Telescope observations reveal</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has undergone significant transformation due to billions of years of exposure to space radiation, according to recent observations made by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This discovery highlights the long-term effects of cosmic radiation on celestial bodies.</p>

<p>This research is important as it enhances understanding of comet evolution and the conditions in space. Scientists from various space agencies, including NASA, are currently analyzing the data gathered by JWST to gain further insights into the comet's structure and history.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been studied using the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>The observations reveal transformations caused by billions of years of space radiation.</li>
    <li>NASA and other space agencies are involved in ongoing research.</li>
    <li>The findings contribute to understanding comet evolution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS have been ongoing since the launch of the JWST. The telescope began capturing data on the comet shortly after its deployment, revealing significant changes in its composition and structure.</p>
<p>As researchers analyze the data, they have identified the influence of cosmic radiation on the comet's surface over an extensive period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The transformation of Comet 3I/ATLAS provides a unique insight into the conditions that comets face over billions of years,” a NASA spokesperson said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study builds on previous research into comet behavior and evolution. Understanding the effects of radiation helps scientists predict how comets might change as they travel through space.</p>
<p>Prior observations of other comets have indicated similar transformations, underscoring the importance of continued observation and analysis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study the data from JWST to further explore the implications of these findings on our understanding of comet evolution and cosmic phenomena.</p>
