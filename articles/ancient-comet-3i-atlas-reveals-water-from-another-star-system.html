      <h2>Ancient Comet 3I/ATLAS Reveals Water from Another Star System</h2>

<p>NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory has detected hydroxyl (OH) gas from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing water from a distant star system. This finding comes as the comet, discovered in July 2025, travels through our Solar System, located nearly three times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth.</p>

<p>The discovery is significant as it challenges existing assumptions about comet behavior, particularly those from outside our Solar System. Researchers are investigating the mechanisms behind this unusual activity, which occurs at a distance where most comets show little to no signs of activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is located approximately 3 times Earth's distance from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be over 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>It is releasing water at a rate of about 40 kg per second.</li>
    <li>Hydroxyl (OH) gas was detected using the Swift Observatory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025. Following its discovery, scientists utilized the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to analyze the comet's composition. The telescope detected faint ultraviolet light emitted from the comet, indicating the presence of hydroxyl gas, a sign of water. This observation occurred while the comet was at a distance from the Sun where typical comets remain inactive.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The ultraviolet glow was crucial because it allowed scientists to detect activity that ground-based telescopes cannot observe,” said Dennis Bodewits, a researcher from Auburn University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Analyzing hydroxyl in interstellar comets could provide key insights into the processes that form planets in other parts of the galaxy,” Bodewits added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of water on comet 3I/ATLAS is a landmark finding in studying interstellar comets. Previous observations of such comets have not reported similar activity, raising questions about the processes that govern their behavior. This discovery could reshape understanding of the chemical makeup of comets from other star systems and their role in planetary formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study comet 3I/ATLAS to further understand the mechanisms behind its activity and the implications for life beyond our Solar System. Observations will focus on identifying factors that might trigger water release at such distances.</p>
