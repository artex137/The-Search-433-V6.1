      <h2>Alien comet reveals stunning tail in latest images</h2>

<p>Astronomers have unveiled new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by telescopes on Earth and various NASA spacecraft, this week. The comet, which is currently passing through our solar system, has garnered attention for its striking tail and the unusual characteristics observed by scientists.</p>

<p>The imagery is significant as it contributes to the ongoing study of interstellar objects. NASA has initiated an extensive observation campaign to track 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, as it exhibits behaviors consistent with a typical comet despite some peculiar features.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in 2025.</li>
    <li>Astronomers have captured images from multiple sources, including NASA spacecraft and the Virtual Telescope Project in Manciano, Italy.</li>
    <li>The comet has a long, wispy tail and an anti-tail, indicating activity consistent with cometary behavior.</li>
    <li>The closest pass by the Sun occurred in October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's observation campaign includes spacecraft such as SOHO, STEREO-A, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>Images have been taken from distances ranging from 30 million km to over 386 million km away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2025 and has since been monitored closely by astronomers. The following events highlight key observations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>September 8-9, 2025:</strong> NASA's Psyche mission captures images of the comet.</li>
    <li><strong>September 16, 2025:</strong> Lucy spacecraft takes a telescopic view of 3I/ATLAS from 386 million km away.</li>
    <li><strong>Early October 2025:</strong> Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Perseverance Rover capture images as the comet passes Mars.</li>
    <li><strong>October 15-26, 2025:</strong> SOHO, STEREO-A, and PUNCH spacecraft collect multiple images during the comet's closest approach to the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA is in the midst of an unprecedented solar system-wide observation campaign, turning its spacecraft and space telescopes to follow comet 3I/ATLAS,” the agency stated on their website.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. Observations of such comets are crucial for understanding the composition and behavior of materials from other star systems. Previous interstellar comets have provided insights into the formation of our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. The agency expects to conduct further observations once the comet is safely observable by powerful telescopes like Hubble and JWST, likely around December 2025.</p>
