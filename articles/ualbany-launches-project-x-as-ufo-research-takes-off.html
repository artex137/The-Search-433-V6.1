      <h2>UAlbany Launches ‘Project X’ as UFO Research Takes Off</h2>

<p>The University at Albany has launched ‘Project X’ (UAPx) to advance research on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), following a significant endowment from local businessman Tony Gorman. The announcement was made on [exact date not disclosed].</p>

<p>This initiative aims to position UAlbany at the forefront of scientific inquiry into UAPs, a field that has gained increasing attention from both the public and government. Gorman's donation supports a team of UAlbany professors who have previously conducted research on UAPs using advanced technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Endowment from Tony Gorman, a local businessman.</li>
    <li>UAlbany professors involved: Kevin Knuth, Matthew Szydagis, and Cecilia Levy.</li>
    <li>Research includes high-tech experiments in California.</li>
    <li>Focus on using weather radar, radiation detectors, and artificial intelligence.</li>
    <li>UAlbany joins a small group of universities, including Harvard, in UAP research.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>UAlbany has received a substantial endowment for UAP research from Tony Gorman, inspired by a local news story featuring the university’s physicists. Following this, the university has established Project X (UAPx) to further its research efforts in this area.</p>

<p>The professors leading this initiative have already published findings on UAPs, utilizing sophisticated methods to analyze aerial phenomena. Their work has garnered attention from Congress and the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The goal is to use real data and real science to get real answers about what’s in our skies or under our oceans,” said a UAlbany official.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UAP research has evolved significantly, moving from conspiracy theories to credible scientific inquiry. This shift has prompted interest from various academic institutions and government entities, highlighting the importance of rigorous scientific methods in understanding aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>UAlbany plans to utilize the funding to advance research initiatives and foster collaborations within the scientific community focused on UAP studies. Further details on specific projects and timelines have not been disclosed.</p>
