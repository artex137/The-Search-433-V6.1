      <h2>Government Insiders Share a Dire Message About UFOs in 'The Age of Disclosure' Sneak Peek</h2>

<p>Experts have shared alarming insights about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in a sneak peek of the upcoming documentary, <strong>The Age of Disclosure</strong>, which premieres on November 21 in select theaters and on Prime Video. The film features interviews with 34 current and former U.S. government and intelligence officials who discuss an alleged 80-year cover-up regarding non-human intelligent life and efforts to reverse-engineer alien technology.</p>

<p>This documentary arrives shortly after September's congressional hearings on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). It aims to shed light on the implications of these encounters and the government's response. Authorities are increasingly focused on transparency, with bipartisan support for the release of UAP reports and briefings for Congress members.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
