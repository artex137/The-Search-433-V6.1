      <h2>American Astrophysicist Finds Way to Move Earth Objects at a Speed of 10,000 km/s</h2>

<p>Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb has proposed a method for using interstellar objects, such as comet 3I/ATLAS, to facilitate future space exploration beyond the Solar System. Loeb presented his findings in a new paper, highlighting the potential of these fast-moving celestial bodies. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this research.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests a pathway for humanity to reach interstellar space much more quickly than previously thought. According to Loeb, utilizing the speed of 3I/ATLAS could allow for human-made spacecraft to arrive in interstellar space by the year 10,000 AD, compared to an estimated 30,000 AD without such assistance. Authorities in astrophysics are now considering the implications of this research for future space missions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at approximately 60 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a professor of natural sciences at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>Loeb has led the Institute for Theory and Computation since 2007.</li>
    <li>He chaired the Department of Astronomy from 2011 to 2020.</li>
    <li>The proposed methods include using a powerful laser beam or interception missions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, the discovery of interstellar objects has increased, with 3I/ATLAS being identified as one of the notable examples. Loeb has been researching the implications of these findings and has now shared his insights on how they can be harnessed for future exploration.</p>

<p>Loeb's research emphasizes the importance of these discoveries, as he suggests that attaching messages or technology to such objects could pave the way for future interstellar communication and exploration.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By riding on comet 3I/ATLAS, which is racing at a speed of 60 kilometers per second, humans could reach interstellar space by around the year 10,000 AD, instead of 30,000 AD,” said Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The discovery of interstellar objects over the past decade opens up new possibilities for humanity to send time capsules into interstellar space,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects has gained momentum over the past decade, leading to new theories about their potential uses. Loeb's work contributes to a growing body of research focused on innovative methods for space exploration, particularly concerning messages and technology that could be sent beyond the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb's findings are expected to inspire further research into the feasibility of using interstellar objects for space missions. Future studies may aim to develop the proposed technologies for attaching messages and conducting interception missions.</p>
