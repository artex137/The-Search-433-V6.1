      <h2>Roswell, New Mexico, UFOs Reign — But Jewish Life Fades</h2>

<p>In Roswell, New Mexico, the legacy of UFOs continues to dominate the cultural landscape, while Jewish life has diminished significantly. The town, known for the infamous 1947 Roswell incident, has seen its only synagogue, Congregation B’nai Israel, close and relocate to Albuquerque five years ago, according to former members.</p>

<p>This situation raises concerns about the preservation of Jewish culture in the region as the fascination with extraterrestrial life persists. Local authorities and community leaders have not taken specific actions to address the decline in Jewish presence, while the popularity of UFO lore continues to thrive.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Location: Roswell, New Mexico</li>
<li>Population: Approximately 47,000</li>
<li>Year of Roswell incident: 1947</li>
<li>Closure of Congregation B’nai Israel: Five years ago</li>
<li>Current Jewish population: Insufficient to form a minyan</li>
<li>Notable figures: Stanton T. Friedman, Avi Loeb</li>
<li>Recent UFO festival: Marked 78 years since the 1947 event</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 1947, rancher W.W. “Mac” Brazen discovered unusual debris on his property, which he reported to Sheriff George Wilcox. The sheriff alerted the Roswell Army Air Field, leading to a statement on July 9 claiming the recovery of a “flying disc.” This claim was quickly retracted, with officials stating the debris was from a crashed weather balloon.</p>

<p>In the decades following, Stanton T. Friedman revisited the incident, advocating for the existence of UFOs. His work inspired ongoing interest in Roswell, culminating in the establishment of the Pentagon’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office. The local UFO festival has become an annual event, attracting thousands.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There was really nothing we could do for them,” said Leslie Lawner, a former member of Congregation B’nai Israel, reflecting on the synagogue's closure.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Most people don’t believe any of this... The question is: why would any intelligent person believe such nonsense to be true?” stated Rabbi Pini Dunner, critiquing the UFO obsession.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Roswell incident has been a focal point for UFO enthusiasts since 1947. Despite multiple investigations, including a 1997 Air Force report that attributed the debris to a secretive balloon project, the belief in extraterrestrial life remains strong. The town's identity has become intertwined with UFO culture, overshadowing other aspects of its community.</p>

<p>Jewish life in Roswell has faced decline, with the small community unable to sustain its synagogue. The few remaining Jewish residents have moved away or passed on, leading to a significant drop in cultural representation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UFOs persists, local leaders have not announced any plans to support the dwindling Jewish community. The annual UFO festival will continue to attract visitors, maintaining Roswell's status as a UFO capital, while the future of Jewish life in the town remains uncertain.</p>
