      <h2>NASA's Mars spacecraft has got us a step closer to discovering what comet 3I/ATLAS is really made of</h2>

<p>NASA's MAVEN spacecraft has observed comet 3I/ATLAS over a 10-day period starting on 27 September 2025, capturing images that reveal new information about its composition. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this scientific endeavor.</p>

<p>This observation is significant because 3I/ATLAS has become one of the most discussed celestial objects of the year. With its trajectory obscured from Earth by the Sun during October, MAVEN provided crucial data that could enhance our understanding of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> MAVEN's observations of comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 27 September to 7 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Mars and surrounding space</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments:</strong> Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS)</li>
    <li><strong>Key findings:</strong> Detection of hydrogen and hydroxyl (OH) gas</li>
    <li><strong>NASA Agency:</strong> Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN)</li>
    <li><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Shannon Curry</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 27 September 2025, MAVEN began its task of observing comet 3I/ATLAS. The observations lasted until 7 October 2025, coinciding with the comet's closest approach to Mars. During this time, MAVEN captured high-resolution ultraviolet images, allowing scientists to identify hydrogen and other molecules emanating from the comet.</p>

<p>On 28 September 2025, MAVEN released an image showing hydrogen atoms surrounding 3I/ATLAS, which was significant for understanding the comet's chemistry. This image was part of a larger effort to gather data before the comet became unobservable from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The images MAVEN captured truly are incredible,” says Shannon Curry, MAVEN’s principal investigator and research scientist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder. “The detections we are seeing are significant, and we have only scraped the surface of our analysis.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There was a lot of adrenaline when we saw what we’d captured,” says MAVEN’s deputy principal investigator, Justin Deighan. “Every measurement we make of this comet helps to open up a new understanding of interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has garnered attention for its potential to be one of the oldest comets ever observed. Previous studies using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected hydroxyl gas at 3I/ATLAS, indicating the presence of water. Understanding the chemical makeup of such comets can provide insights into their origins and the early Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from MAVEN's observations. This research may yield further insights into the composition and evolution of 3I/ATLAS and contribute to broader studies of interstellar objects.</p>
