      <h2>A Mars Probe Snapped a Photo of 3I/ATLAS — Very Likely a Comet, Not a Spaceship</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s Exomars Trace Gas Orbiter has captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object discovered by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile. This event occurred last week and marks a significant moment in the study of celestial bodies originating from outside the solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it highlights humanity's progress in documenting interstellar objects. The European Space Agency (ESA) has noted that 3I/ATLAS is only the third such object identified, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The findings underscore the ongoing exploration of our solar system and the potential for understanding more about the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on camera by ESA’s Exomars Trace Gas Orbiter.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Discovered by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet was first detected in the summer of 2023.</li>
    <li>ESA has released a series of images documenting this event.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA’s ATLAS telescope discovered 3I/ATLAS in the summer of 2023. Shortly after its discovery, the comet was observed by the Exomars Trace Gas Orbiter, which has since provided images of the object. This event is part of a broader trend of increasing documentation of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>In 2017, 1I/‘Oumuamua was the first interstellar object identified, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019. These discoveries have sparked interest in the study of objects that originate outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I/ATLAS demonstrates our progress in understanding the broader universe,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are still scratching the surface of our own solar system,” noted a researcher involved in the study of interstellar objects.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The identification of 3I/ATLAS builds on previous discoveries of interstellar objects, particularly 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These events have prompted increased scientific interest and research into the nature of such objects and their origins.</p>

<p>Debates surrounding the potential for these objects to be artificial in origin have emerged, particularly with claims made by some scientists regarding their nature. Such discussions reflect the ongoing curiosity about the universe and the possibilities it holds.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing research will focus on further observations of 3I/ATLAS as it continues its trajectory through the solar system. Scientists aim to gather more data on its composition and behavior, enhancing our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
