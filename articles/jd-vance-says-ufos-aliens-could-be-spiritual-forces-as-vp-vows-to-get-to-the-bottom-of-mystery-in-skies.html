      <h2>JD Vance says UFOs, aliens could be ‘spiritual forces’ as VP vows to ‘get to the bottom’ of mystery in skies</h2>

<p>Vice President JD Vance has discussed the mystery of UFOs, suggesting that some unexplained phenomena may represent "spiritual forces" affecting the physical world. Vance made these comments during an interview with New York Post columnist Miranda Devine on her podcast "Pod Force One" this week.</p>

<p>Vance's remarks come amid growing interest in UFOs, officially known as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), in Washington. He stated that he intends to investigate further, emphasizing the need to uncover the truth behind these occurrences. "I can’t allow myself to become so busy that I don’t get to the bottom of this," Vance said.</p>
