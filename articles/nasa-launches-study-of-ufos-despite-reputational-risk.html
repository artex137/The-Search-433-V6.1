      <h2>NASA launches study of UFOs despite 'reputational risk'</h2>

<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA has launched a study of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), commonly referred to as UFOs, as part of a new initiative towards high-impact scientific inquiry. The space agency announced the formation of an independent team on June 9, 2022, to assess the available public information on UAPs and identify gaps in understanding unexplained sightings.</p>

<p>This study is significant as it represents NASA's commitment to exploring a controversial topic, despite potential criticism from the scientific community. NASA's science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, stated that the agency is not deterred by reputational risks associated with the subject. He emphasized the need for more data to better understand these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The study begins in fall 2022 and will last for nine months.</li>
    <li>The estimated cost of the study is no more than $100,000.</li>
    <li>The team will not utilize classified military data.</li>
    <li>Astrophysicist David Spergel will lead the research team.</li>
    <li>The goal is to enhance understanding of UAPs and their possible explanations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 9, 2022, NASA announced the creation of an independent team to study UAPs. The study is set to begin in the fall of 2022 and will last for nine months. The agency aims to gather and analyze publicly available data on UAPs to better understand these unexplained sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We are not shying away from reputational risk,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's science mission chief, during a National Academy of Sciences webcast.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We have to approach all these questions with a sense of humility,” stated David Spergel, the study team leader. “I spent most of my career as a cosmologist. I can tell you we don't know what makes up 95% of the universe. So there are things we don't understand.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study is part of a broader initiative to address the lack of data regarding UAPs. Historically, the scientific community has approached the topic with skepticism, often dismissing it due to insufficient evidence. NASA's engagement in this area signals a shift towards a more open inquiry into phenomena that have been largely unexplored.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the study progresses, NASA plans to release findings and recommendations based on the gathered data. The agency aims to use the insights to inform future investigations into UAPs and enhance public understanding of these phenomena.</p>
