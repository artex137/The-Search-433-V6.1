      <h2>It's official - the European Space Agency will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS with Hubble, James Webb and other missions</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed it will continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS using the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and additional missions. The ESA aims to gather data on the comet as it travels through the Solar System at an unprecedented speed of approximately 210,000 km/h.</p>

<p>This monitoring is significant because 3I/ATLAS is a unique interstellar object that has likely traveled through space for billions of years. ESA has mobilized its telescopes and spacecraft to study the comet's characteristics, including its brightness, coma shape, and particle emissions. Although no spacecraft can currently reach the comet, ESA's observations will enhance understanding of its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at a speed of approximately 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>ESA is utilizing Hubble, James Webb, Mars Express, TGO, and JUICE for observations.</li>
    <li>The comet has been in space for billions of years and originates from outside the Solar System.</li>
    <li>ESA is preparing the Comet Interceptor for future missions targeting interstellar objects.</li>
    <li>Current calculations indicate that the comet will not pass close to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>ESA has initiated monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS as it enters the Solar System. The exact date of its discovery is not disclosed, but scientists have begun deploying various telescopes to study the comet's features. The agency has confirmed that no spacecraft can reach the comet due to its high speed, but it has set plans in motion to gather data remotely.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet is very special and presents a unique opportunity for scientists to understand interstellar objects,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of several interstellar objects detected in recent years. These objects provide valuable insights into the formation of solar systems and the materials present in deep space. ESA's ongoing research aims to enhance planetary defense strategies and improve knowledge of potential future interstellar encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA will continue its monitoring efforts and analysis of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the inner Solar System. The agency is expected to release findings as observations progress and will prepare for future missions involving the Comet Interceptor.</p>
