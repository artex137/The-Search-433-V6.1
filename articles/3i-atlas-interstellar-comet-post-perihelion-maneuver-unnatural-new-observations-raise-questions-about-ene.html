      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet Raises Questions After New Observations</h2>

<p>New observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have prompted researchers to question the nature of its post-perihelion maneuver, with findings indicating the comet has remained a single body after perihelion, which occurred two weeks prior on October 27, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges current understanding of comet behavior. Researchers are investigating whether the activity observed is natural or indicative of an unnatural process. The findings could have implications for the study of interstellar objects and the dynamics of their movement in space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images taken on November 11, 2025, show 3I/ATLAS as a single body.</li>
    <li>Distance from 3I/ATLAS to the Sun was 1.43 astronomical units (au); distance from Earth was 2.16 au.</li>
    <li>Jet structures were reported to extend one million kilometers towards the Sun and three million kilometers in the opposite direction.</li>
    <li>Estimated mass flux of the jets is about five billion tons each month.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a maximum diameter of 5.6 kilometers, according to earlier Hubble Space Telescope estimates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>October 27, 2025: 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion, with no evidence of fragmentation noted at that time.</p>
<p>November 9, 2025: Observations reveal long-range jets extending towards the Sun and in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>November 11, 2025: New images taken by David Jewitt and Jane Luu show 3I/ATLAS as a single body, indicating strong elongation and jet asymmetry.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activity observed does not match the expected behavior of a natural comet,” said Avi Loeb in an article on Medium. “Researchers must address this anomaly rather than ignore it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies of comets have shown that they typically fragment or exhibit specific behaviors as they approach the Sun. The unusual observations of 3I/ATLAS, including its lack of fragmentation and high energy needs, diverge from these established patterns, raising questions about the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are continuing to analyze the new data to determine the implications of the comet's behavior. Further investigations may focus on refining mass loss calculations and understanding the jet patterns observed in the images.</p>
