      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Professor Avi Loeb Reveals Six Major Anomalies In The Exocomet With No Simple Explanation</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has identified six major anomalies associated with comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Chile-based Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The comet, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), has puzzled scientists since its detection.</p>

<p>Loeb's research suggests that these anomalies may indicate an artificial origin for the comet, potentially linked to alien technology. This revelation has prompted further scrutiny from the scientific community and has raised questions about the nature of interstellar objects entering the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovered by: Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Encounter with Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Forecasted perijove distance: 53.445 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Nucleus mass: Roughly 1 million times more massive than 1I/`Oumuamua</li>
    <li>Gas plume composition: Contains more nickel than iron</li>
    <li>Trajectory alignment: Within 5 degrees of the ecliptic plane</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was initially identified as an interstellar object by ATLAS on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, it was temporarily listed on the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page by the Minor Planet Center. Since then, researchers, including Loeb, have examined its unusual behavior, leading to the identification of various anomalies.</p>
<p>On March 16, 2026, the comet is expected to encounter Jupiter, which has raised further interest in its trajectory and potential implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The forecasted perijove distance of 3I/ATLAS during its encounter with Jupiter is identical to Jupiter’s Hill radius,” Loeb stated in his latest blog post. “This match might indicate that 3I/ATLAS intends to release technological devices as artificial satellites of Jupiter.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time an interstellar object has generated excitement among scientists. Previous objects, such as 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also spurred debate about their origins. However, 3I/ATLAS stands out due to its significant mass and the unique characteristics of its gas plume.</p>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has prompted discussions about the existence of advanced technology beyond Earth and the potential for future encounters with similar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. Further studies are expected to focus on its composition and trajectory, with the aim of gaining more insights into its origins and implications for our understanding of interstellar phenomena.</p>
