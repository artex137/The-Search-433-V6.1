      <h2>New Image Reveals Comet 3I/ATLAS’s Transformation After Close Approach to the Sun</h2>

<p>A new image of comet 3I/ATLAS has been unveiled, showcasing its features as captured by the Gemini North telescope in Maunakea, Hawaii. The comet gained attention in 2025 when it was discovered traversing our Solar System, with origins likely dating back to a distant star. This interstellar object is believed to be the oldest comet observed to date and one of only three known interstellar comets.</p>

<p>The latest image illustrates the transformations that have taken place following the comet's close approach to the Sun in late 2025. This event significantly affected the comet, which is characterized by its composition of frozen ice. As it neared the Sun, increased heat caused gas to vent from its surface. The observations were part of a broader public outreach initiative by NSF NOIRLab, the U.S. National Science Foundation's center for ground-based optical-infrared astronomy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Image captured on November 26, 2025.</li>
    <li>Location: Gemini North telescope, Maunakea, Hawaii.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar comets.</li>
    <li>Previous images taken in Chile showed the comet with a red hue.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits a green glow attributed to diatomic carbon gases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered as it traversed the Solar System. Following its close approach to the Sun in late 2025, the comet underwent significant transformations, observed through various imaging techniques.</p>
<p>The latest image, captured on November 26, 2025, revealed a distinct shift in color as the comet warmed and emitted gas. This was part of ongoing monitoring efforts by astronomers as the comet continues its journey.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Sharing this observing experience with the public provides an intimate view of the comet's journey and the astronomical methods employed to study it,” said Bryce Bolin, a research scientist with Eureka Scientific.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the oldest comet observed to date. Its behavior as it interacts with solar radiation adds to scientists' understanding of interstellar comets. Previous images highlighted its color changes, which are crucial for interpreting the comet's physical state and responses to solar warming.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue their observations of comet 3I/ATLAS as it journeys out of our Solar System. They aim to monitor any delayed responses to solar warming that may lead to further gas emissions.</p>
