      <h2>Navy kept UFO logbooks tracking 'fast movers' under ocean, ex-submarine worker claims</h2>

<p>A former submarine technician has claimed that the US Navy maintained logbooks documenting fast-moving unidentified objects traveling through the world's oceans. The allegations surfaced following a 2024 document detailing 21 unexplained UFO encounters, acknowledged by the US government after Congress received the report from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).</p>

<p>The claims highlight the ongoing investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), commonly known as UFOs. The AARO has stated that it is working with the Intelligence Community to analyze these cases and will notify Congress if any significant findings arise.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Former submarine technician revealed logbooks for unidentified objects.</li>
    <li>2024 document detailed 21 unexplained UFO encounters.</li>
    <li>Report received by Congress from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).</li>
    <li>Claims include sightings of a green fireball and a jellyfish-like object.</li>
    <li>AARO reported no evidence of extraterrestrial activity or technology.</li>
    <li>Mike Gold, former NASA Associate Administrator, urged NASA to lead investigations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2024, a document emerged from the AARO detailing 21 unexplained encounters with UFOs, prompting scrutiny from Congress. A Reddit user named Dabier shared insights from a retired Cold War submariner about the Navy's logbooks for unidentified contacts. The submariner described entries that included fast-moving objects and strange noises not attributable to known sources.</p>

<p>Over the years, reports of UAPs have included various sightings, such as a green fireball and a multicoloured jellyfish-like object. Some objects were later identified as weather balloons or satellites, while others remain unexplained.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>AARO stated, "It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology."</blockquote>
<blockquote>AARO added, "None of these resolved cases substantiated advanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Mike Gold cautioned, "the truth is out there" and urged NASA to take the lead in tracking suspected UFOs.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior incidents involving UAPs have raised questions about military monitoring and public transparency. The ongoing efforts by AARO reflect a broader interest in understanding unidentified phenomena, especially as technology improves and more sightings are reported.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>AARO will continue its analysis of the reported cases and will inform Congress of any findings that may indicate significant advancements in foreign aerospace capabilities.</p>
