      <h2>New Images Capture an Interstellar Comet Making Its Closest Approach to Earth</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025, is nearing its closest approach to Earth, set to occur on December 19, 2025. The comet poses no threat to Earth, but offers astronomers a rare opportunity to study a unique interstellar visitor.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest in the scientific community. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) have provided new insights into the comet's characteristics and activity. Researchers are eager to gather data on its composition and behavior as it passes through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
  <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
  <li>Distance at closest approach: 167 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
  <li>Initial observations by Hubble: late November 2025, at 178 million miles (286 million kilometers) from Earth</li>
  <li>JUICE spacecraft distance from 3I/ATLAS: 41 million miles (66 million kilometers) in early November 2025</li>
  <li>Next data expected from JUICE: February 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025. Hubble Space Telescope captured initial images in late November 2025, revealing its teardrop shape. In early November 2025, the JUICE mission, while en route to study Jupiter, observed the comet from a distance of 41 million miles.</p>
<p>As the comet approached the sun in October 2025, observations showed gases sublimating from its surface, providing clues about its composition. The comet's flyby has allowed scientists to study its two distinct tails: a plasma tail and a dust tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations of 3I/ATLAS are critical to understanding the composition of interstellar objects,” according to NASA. “These observations, combined with new data from Hubble and JUICE, are helping astronomers determine the comet’s trajectory and the materials it is made of.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object to be observed passing through our solar system. Its study could provide insights into the conditions and materials present in other star systems, which are essential for understanding planetary and stellar formation across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The JUICE mission will continue to collect data on 3I/ATLAS, with additional information expected to be sent back to Earth in February 2026. This data will include high-resolution optical images and composition data, further enhancing our understanding of this rare interstellar comet.</p>
