      <h2>Harvard astrophysicist refutes Kaku on interstellar object 3I/ATLAS and demands data from NASA</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist from Harvard University, has responded to Michio Kaku's criticisms regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS in a recent interview. Kaku characterized the object as a 7-billion-year-old ancient rock covered in space debris, while Loeb defended his scientific analysis. NASA has not yet released high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS, which were captured in October 2025.</p>

<p>This debate is significant as 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, with its perigee scheduled for December 2025. Loeb has called for transparency from NASA, emphasizing the need for data to support scientific inquiry. The object, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system, has raised questions about its unusual characteristics and potential implications for our understanding of interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>Loeb's team has tracked the object since its detection in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to reach its closest point to Earth in December 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA captured high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS in October 2025.</li>
    <li>The object's speed has been measured at approximately 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS displays non-gravitational acceleration and lacks a traditional comet tail after perihelion.</li>
    <li>Current monitoring involves international teams from North America, Europe, and Asia.</li>
    <li>NASA has stated that the object poses no threat, with a minimum distance of 267 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS system. Observations have since revealed its unusual characteristics, including a speed of 58 km/s and non-gravitational acceleration. In October 2025, NASA captured high-resolution images of the object, but these images have not yet been released to the public. The object is expected to reach its perigee in December 2025.</p>

<blockquote>“My hypotheses are based on data, not popularization,” Loeb stated, criticizing Kaku's lack of publications on the topic.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, which have prompted discussions about the nature of such visitors. Loeb has raised the possibility of advanced technology or antimatter presence associated with 3I/ATLAS, challenging conventional interpretations of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb has urged NASA to release the October images for collective analysis by the scientific community. Ongoing monitoring of 3I/ATLAS will continue as it approaches Earth, with international teams coordinating observations during this period.</p>
