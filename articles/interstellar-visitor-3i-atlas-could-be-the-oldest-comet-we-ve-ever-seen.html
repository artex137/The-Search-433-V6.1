      <h2>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS could be the oldest comet we've ever seen</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS has been discovered by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope. Currently located 675 million km (420 million miles) away, 3I/ATLAS may be the oldest comet observed to date, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the origins of interstellar objects and their role in star and planet formation. The team behind the discovery, which includes astronomer Matthew Hopkins, has developed a model to predict the properties of interstellar objects based on their orbits. 3I/ATLAS could help validate this model and enhance understanding of ancient celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently 675 million km (420 million miles) from Earth.</li>
    <li>It is potentially over 7 billion years old, making it the oldest known comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 2I/Borisov (2019) and ‘Oumuamua (2017).</li>
    <li>The comet is believed to have originated from the Milky Way’s ‘thick disc’ region.</li>
    <li>The team includes Matthew Hopkins and Professor Chris Lintott.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope. The discovery has generated excitement among astronomers, including Matthew Hopkins, who received numerous messages upon the discovery.</p>

<p>The team has utilized the Ōtautahi–Oxford model to analyze the comet’s trajectory and predict its properties, suggesting it formed in an ancient stellar region.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Rather than the quiet Wednesday I had planned, I woke up to messages like ‘3I!!!!!!!!!!’,” said Matthew Hopkins, one of the astronomers who discovered the comet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is an object from a part of the Galaxy we’ve never seen up close before,” stated Professor Chris Lintott, who co-authored the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant in the study of interstellar objects, following the discoveries of ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These prior discoveries have shaped our understanding of objects that do not originate from our Solar System.</p>

<p>The potential for 3I/ATLAS to be rich in water-ice may also provide further insights into the composition and formation processes of ancient celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists will monitor its surface heating and observe the potential formation of a glowing tail, which could yield valuable data about its composition and behavior.</p>
