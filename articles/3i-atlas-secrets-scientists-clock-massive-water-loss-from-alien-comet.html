      <h2>3I/ATLAS Secrets: Scientists Clock Massive Water Loss From Alien Comet</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed significant water loss from comet 3I/ATLAS, which entered the inner solar system at a speed of 61 km/s (136,000 mph) and was first detected by the ATLAS survey in Chile on July 1, 2025. The comet, estimated to be between 8 and 13 billion years old, is currently on a hyperbolic trajectory away from the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is essential for understanding the composition of interstellar objects and their origins. Researchers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to compare its chemical makeup with that of local comets, particularly its unique abundance of atomic nickel. The data collected may provide insights into the formation of our own solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion, its closest point to the sun, on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 AU.</li>
    <li>On November 6, 2025, the comet shed water at a peak rate of 3.17×10<sup>29</sup> molecules per second.</li>
    <li>By early December 2025, its water output decreased to approximately 1–2×10<sup>28</sup> molecules per second.</li>
    <li>During the month following perihelion, the comet released over 13.5 million metric tons of water.</li>
    <li>The comet passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 AU (270 million km).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS survey in Chile. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, and exhibited a peak water loss on November 6, 2025. By early December, its water output had significantly declined. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and is expected to pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We find no credible detections of narrowband radio technosignatures originating from 3I/ATLAS,” said Ben Jacobson-Bell, lead author of a study using the Green Bank Telescope.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor in history, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. The comet's unique properties and water loss have sparked interest in the study of interstellar materials and their implications for understanding the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will conduct further observations, particularly during its upcoming close pass near Jupiter in March 2026, before it disappears into deep space.</p>
