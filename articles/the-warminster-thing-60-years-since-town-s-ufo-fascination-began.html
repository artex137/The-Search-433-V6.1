<blockquote>“I think it's a little bit like magic. If you really knew what was going on, it would take the interest out of it,” said Lesley Blain, a member of the Heart of Warminster group.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What's vital is to record for posterity what people have seen. They exist, what they are and where they come from is another matter,” said former police officer John Hanson.</blockquote>
