      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS and Other Celestial Events Highlight Night Sky</h2>

<p>Four comets are currently visible in the night sky, including interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which remains faint as it approaches its perihelion near Mars. Three comets are observable in the evening, while one can be seen in the morning. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This celestial display is significant for astronomers and skywatchers. Authorities, including NASA, have noted that comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) is particularly stunning, having been imaged recently and featured on NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD). Observers are encouraged to take advantage of the clear skies to witness these comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently too faint to be easily viewed.</li>
    <li>C/2025 R1 (SWAN) is currently visible and displaying a blue/green glow.</li>
    <li>C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) is expected to brighten after perihelion.</li>
    <li>Comets visible with the naked eye must be at magnitude 6.5 or lower.</li>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was imaged on September 17, 2025.</li>
    <li>Meteor showers are anticipated around October 5, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 13, 2025, Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was photographed at sunset just above the western horizon in Zacatecas, Mexico. This image was later featured on NASA's APOD. On September 17, the same comet was imaged again by Team Ciel Austral.</p>
<p>As Earth approaches October 5, 2025, it will pass through the plane of the comet's orbit, leading to expected meteor showers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) continues to impress with its distinctive glow,” said a representative from NASA. “We encourage everyone to look up and enjoy the night sky.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time comets have drawn attention from astronomers and the public. The visibility of comets often coincides with meteor showers, enhancing the experience for skywatchers. The current lineup of comets offers a unique opportunity for observation and study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers are advised to monitor the night sky as meteor showers approach in early October. Further imaging and studies of the comets will continue, with updates expected from NASA and other astronomical organizations.</p>
