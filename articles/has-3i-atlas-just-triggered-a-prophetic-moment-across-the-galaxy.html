      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches the Sun</h2>
<p>The unidentified space object 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its closest point to the Sun on Wednesday, October 29, 2025, at a distance of 203 million kilometres, according to Harvard professor Avi Loeb. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This upcoming approach has sparked significant interest among scientists and the public. Loeb, a leading voice on the subject, suggests that 3I/ATLAS may not just be a comet but could potentially be an object produced by intelligent beings. He has also raised concerns that it could pose a threat, as it is emitting a metal compound typically associated with industrial manufacturing.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at closest point: 203 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Notable figure: Avi Loeb, Harvard professor</li>
    <li>Concerns raised about potential threats associated with the object</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has garnered attention as it travels through the Solar System. Loeb has published insights regarding the object's trajectory and potential implications. He has suggested that its unusual emissions may indicate a manufactured origin, rather than a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2025, the comet will complete half of its journey through the Solar System, marking a significant milestone in its path.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated that 3I/ATLAS may be a "Trojan Horse with the external appearance of a natural comet but carrying a potential threat in its interior."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb has also noted that the object is emitting a metal compound produced only through industrial manufacturing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around 3I/ATLAS has coincided with the resurgence of interest in predictions made by Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian mystic who foresaw 2025 as the year of contact with alien life. However, there is no direct evidence supporting Vanga's claims.</p>
<p>As speculation continues, some observers caution against interpreting these events as signs of divine revelation or prophetic moments, urging a focus on discernment instead.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, further observations and studies will likely be conducted to understand the nature of the object. The scientific community will continue to monitor its path and emissions as it nears its closest point to the Sun.</p>
