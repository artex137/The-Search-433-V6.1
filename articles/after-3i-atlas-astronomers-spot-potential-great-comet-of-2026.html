      <h2>After 3I/ATLAS, astronomers spot potential ‘Great Comet of 2026'</h2>

<p>On January 15, 2026, astronomers have identified a new comet, designated C/2025 R3, which they believe could be the “great comet of 2026.” The comet was first detected by the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) on the summit of Haleakala volcano in Hawaii on September 8, 2025. Currently, C/2025 R3 is approximately 216 million miles from Earth and is expected to reach its closest point to the planet in April.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as C/2025 R3 could become visible to the naked eye, providing a spectacle for skywatchers. Experts anticipate that the comet will come within 44 million miles of Earth on April 27, 2026, just a week after its closest approach to the Sun on April 20, where it will be about 47.4 million miles away.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R3 was discovered on September 8, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is currently 216 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the Sun is on April 20, 2026, at 47.4 million miles.</li>
    <li>It will approach Earth on April 27, 2026, at a distance of 44 million miles.</li>
    <li>Estimates suggest it could reach a brightness of magnitude 2.5.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 8, 2025, astronomers at Pan-STARRS first spotted C/2025 R3. Since then, they have monitored the comet's trajectory as it travels towards the Sun and Earth. As of January 15, 2026, the comet is approximately 216 million miles from Earth, with its closest approaches scheduled for April 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Experts believe that R3 could become visible to the naked eye,” said a spokesperson from Pan-STARRS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In 2025, the comet 3I/ATLAS captured significant attention, generating various conspiracy theories, including claims it was an alien UFO. 3I/ATLAS is projected to exit the solar system by 2030.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor C/2025 R3's trajectory and brightness as it approaches Earth and the Sun in April 2026.</p>
