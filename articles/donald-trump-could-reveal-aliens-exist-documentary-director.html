      <h2>Donald Trump Could Reveal Aliens Exist—Documentary Director</h2>

<p>Documentary maker Dan Farah has stated that President Donald Trump could potentially reveal the existence of aliens in the near future. Farah, director of The Age of Disclosure, believes the release of his film may prompt such an announcement.</p>

<p>This claim holds significance as nearly two-thirds of Americans believe intelligent life exists beyond Earth, according to a 2021 study by the Pew Research Center. Some Americans suspect that evidence of UFOs and alien life is being concealed by global governments. Congress has previously conducted hearings on reported UFO sightings, and Trump has indicated his administration may declassify information regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary: The Age of Disclosure</li>
    <li>Director: Dan Farah</li>
    <li>Number of government insiders featured: 34</li>
    <li>Notable figures included: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper</li>
    <li>Availability: The Age of Disclosure is available on Prime Video</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Farah has suggested that the release of The Age of Disclosure could lead to a historic announcement by a sitting president regarding extraterrestrial life. In prior statements, Trump has expressed skepticism about UFOs and claimed he has never been a believer.</p>
<p>The documentary posits that there has been a decades-long government cover-up regarding extraterrestrial intelligence. This theory has faced criticism from some scientists who reject the premise.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I think it’s only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, ‘We’re not alone in the universe,’” said Dan Farah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Something I’m proud of with the film is that it’s really not people sharing theories. It’s people who have direct knowledge of the topic as a result of working for the U.S. government, sharing what they can lawfully disclose about what they know,” Farah added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Joe Rogan described the documentary as “one of the best documentaries on the whole UFO phenomenon ever.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I have seen no evidence that the government has been hiding anything,” stated Joshua Semeter, a professor at Boston University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Representative Nancy Mace called the documentary “very interesting” and noted it is “serious” and “well-done.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The belief in alien life and government cover-ups has been a topic of interest for decades. While many Americans support the idea of extraterrestrial existence, scientific consensus largely rejects claims of government concealment. Congressional hearings on UFO sightings have occurred intermittently, reflecting ongoing public interest in the topic.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Age of Disclosure is currently available for viewing on Prime Video, allowing audiences to explore the documentary's claims regarding extraterrestrial intelligence and government secrecy.</p>
