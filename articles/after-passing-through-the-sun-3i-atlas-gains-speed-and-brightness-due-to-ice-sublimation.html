      <h2>After passing through the Sun, 3I/Atlas gains speed and brightness due to ice sublimation</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun, according to astronomers from NASA and ESA. The comet, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, has shown significant changes in color and speed following its closest approach.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the Solar System, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Observations have revealed a unique composition with high levels of carbon dioxide, raising interest among researchers studying the origins of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery: July 2025 by ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: 1.4 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Initial speed: 210,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Current speed at perihelion: 68 km/s</li>
    <li>Core diameter: between 440 meters and 5.6 km</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: more than 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Next close approach: Venus at 97 million km on November 3, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025 and approached the Sun, reaching its perihelion on October 29, 2025. Following this, it exhibited significant changes in brightness and speed. Observations from various telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, have been ongoing since its discovery.</p>

<p>On October 31, 2025, the comet became visible from ground-based telescopes. It is expected to pass Venus on November 3, 2025, and will approach Earth at 1.8 astronomical units in December 2025. In March 2026, it will pass close to Jupiter at a distance of 54 million km.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The changes in speed and brightness of 3I/Atlas are fascinating and provide a unique opportunity to study the properties of interstellar comets,” said an astronomer from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is notable for its high concentration of carbon dioxide, which is unprecedented in comets. Its hyperbolic trajectory and speed confirm its external origin. The comet's composition and behavior have sparked interest among scientists studying celestial bodies from outside the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct exercises with the International Asteroid Warning Network to refine orbital measurements by January 2026. Probes like ESA's Juice will attempt observations of the comet in March 2026, providing further insights into its characteristics as it returns to interstellar space.</p>
