      <h2>Earth prepares to observe comet 3I/Atlas, the third confirmed interstellar visitor</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has become visible again to space probes and may soon be observable from Earth as it approaches perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, according to NASA. The comet is only the third interstellar object confirmed by modern astronomy and is one of the fastest ever observed, traveling at more than 210,000 km/h.</p>

<p>This event presents a rare opportunity for scientists to study the composition of bodies from other stars and to test new interplanetary tracking techniques. The International Asteroid Warning Network has included Comet 3I/Atlas in its global exercise program to test planetary defense algorithms and protocols, highlighting the significance of this celestial object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas travels at over 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>It is currently visible to space probes and may be observable from Earth.</li>
    <li>The best visibility period is expected from late November to early December.</li>
    <li>The comet has a low brightness magnitude of around 12, making it invisible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>It will not return to the Solar System due to its hyperbolic trajectory.</li>
    <li>The comet's passage will be monitored for particles from its tail, which may contain elements formed outside the Sun's environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was obscured by the Sun during its closest approach, preventing direct observation. With its change in position, it has now become visible to space probes. Researchers anticipate that the comet will be observable from Earth starting in late November.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches, scientists are preparing to analyze its tail for unique particles. Each observation will contribute to the understanding of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a moving cosmic laboratory. Each fragment analyzed helps us decipher how different planetary systems evolve,” a NASA spokesperson said regarding the significance of Comet 3I/Atlas.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since the detection of 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, the study of interstellar objects has become a permanent focus in astronomy. The observation of Comet 3I/Atlas marks a new era in the field, broadening the understanding of galactic dynamics and the origins of elements that contribute to planets and potential life forms.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/Atlas continues its trajectory into deep space, scientists will collect and analyze data over the coming weeks. This data will provide an unrepeatable record of the comet's composition and behavior.</p>
