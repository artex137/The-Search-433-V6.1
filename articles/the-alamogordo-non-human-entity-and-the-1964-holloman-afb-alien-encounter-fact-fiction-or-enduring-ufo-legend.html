      <h2>The “Alamogordo Non-Human Entity” and the 1964 Holloman AFB Alien Encounter: Fact, Fiction, or Enduring UFO Legend?</h2>

<p>Alamogordo, NM — December 19, 2025 — The “Alamogordo Non-Human Entity Incident” has resurfaced as a topic of intrigue, recalling a purported event from 1964 at Holloman Air Force Base, where witnesses claim non-human entities emerged from a landed craft. This encounter allegedly involved Air Force and CIA personnel, and has sparked ongoing speculation regarding its authenticity and implications for UFO research.</p>

<p>The incident has prompted renewed interest from authorities and researchers, particularly following recent documentaries that have revisited the claims. Vice President JD Vance has publicly expressed his fascination with UFOs and has indicated a desire to investigate classified information related to such phenomena. The enduring nature of this story highlights the intersection of military secrecy, popular culture, and public curiosity about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Incident occurred in April or May 1964, exact date not disclosed.</li>
<li>Location: Holloman Air Force Base, near White Sands Missile Range, NM.</li>
<li>Three unidentified craft reportedly approached the base, one allegedly landed.</li>
<li>Military personnel reportedly interacted with a “non-human entity” and exchanged monkeys.</li>
<li>Claims of a 16mm film documenting the encounter remain classified.</li>
<li>Vice President JD Vance has expressed interest in UFOs and plans to investigate classified files.</li>
<li>No official records or declassified documents confirming the incident have been released.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to various accounts, radar at Holloman tracked three unidentified objects approaching the base in April or May 1964. One craft reportedly struggled before landing, and military personnel allegedly interacted with non-human entities that emerged from the craft. The encounter included an exchange involving monkeys, which some narratives link to the Alamogordo Monkey Farm.</p>

<p>The story gained traction in the 1970s when filmmaker Robert Emenegger claimed the Department of Defense promised him footage of the landing for his documentary. Although he was later instructed to present the incident as hypothetical, he asserted that he had viewed the film documenting the event.</p>

<p>In 2025, astrophysicist Eric Davis, a former advisor to the Pentagon’s AATIP, revived the claims in an Amazon Prime documentary, stating that former President George H.W. Bush had confirmed knowledge of the encounter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true,” said Vice President JD Vance during a press interaction in Pennsylvania.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Alamogordo Non-Human Entity Incident is often compared to other famous UFO sightings, such as the Socorro incident in 1964, where officer Lonnie Zamora reported seeing an egg-shaped craft and two beings. The narrative has been further fueled by documentaries and discussions surrounding government secrecy and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Despite the allure of the story, it remains largely unverified and is often dismissed as a conspiracy theory. The U.S. Air Force has consistently denied any extraterrestrial involvement in sightings attributed to the base, attributing most incidents to experimental technology or misidentified natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims surrounding the 1964 incident may continue, particularly with Vice President JD Vance’s interest in accessing classified information. As public curiosity remains high, further discussions and documentaries are likely to keep the legend alive.</p>
