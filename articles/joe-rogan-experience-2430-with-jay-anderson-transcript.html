      <h2>Joe Rogan Experience Features Jay Anderson on UFOs</h2>

<p>On December 24, 2025, researcher Jay Anderson appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience #2430 to discuss UFO phenomena and ancient mysteries, including his work on Project Unity. The episode features Anderson's insights into megalithic sites in Peru and controversial findings related to the Nazca mummies, which he claims challenge our understanding of human evolution.</p>

<p>This conversation is significant as it sheds light on ongoing debates about extraterrestrial life and the implications for national security. Anderson's findings could provoke further interest in ancient civilizations and their potential connections to modern-day UFO phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Joe Rogan Experience #2430</li>
    <li>Guest: Jay Anderson, researcher and creator of Project Unity</li>
