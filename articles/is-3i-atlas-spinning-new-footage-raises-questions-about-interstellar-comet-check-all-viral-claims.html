      <h2>New Footage Raises Questions About Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>New footage of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked speculation about its behavior, with some observers suggesting it may be spinning or developing unusual structures. The claims emerged online on November 21, 2025, and have circulated widely across social media and astronomy forums, but remain unverified by scientific authorities.</p>

<p>The excitement surrounding the comet's potential spinning behavior has prompted interest from both amateur and professional astronomers. However, NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have not confirmed any of these claims. The footage includes images and videos from various sources, including Ray’s Astrophotography and independent imager Diego San Araujo, who shared their observations of the comet’s behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at over 210,000 km/h and will permanently leave the solar system after its passage.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently visible in the predawn sky during November and December, though not visible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>No official confirmation from NASA or ESA regarding claims of spinning or structural anomalies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. It reached its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025. Following this, reports of its unusual behavior began circulating on social media in mid-November, specifically around November 18 and 21, 2025. Users shared images and videos suggesting a spinning structure, but these claims remain unverified.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Astronomers say upcoming high-resolution data from NASA should help determine whether the comet’s appearance is the result of genuine rotational dynamics or simply the natural quirks of a dusty, fast-moving, interstellar visitor.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Despite its unusual interstellar origin, astronomers have noted that it behaves as expected for a comet and does not pose any threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to release high-resolution data in the future, which may clarify the comet's behavior and address the ongoing speculation regarding its spinning claims.</p>
