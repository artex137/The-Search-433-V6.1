      <h2>3I/ATLAS came from mysterious frontier of Early Milky Way</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been identified as originating from the early Milky Way, according to a recent study. Astronomers have confirmed its unusual trajectory and high speed, which suggest it has traveled through space for millions, possibly billions, of years. The comet was first spotted in late June 2023 and confirmed by NASA in early July.</p>

<p>This research matters as it may provide insights into the comet's age, its journey, and the early history of the Milky Way galaxy. Scientists have analyzed data from the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescope to better understand its origins and trajectory. Current observations show that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in late June 2023 and confirmed by NASA in early July.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be between 4.8 and 11.2 kilometers wide.</li>
    <li>It travels at approximately 210,000 km/h, making it the fastest interstellar object detected.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed near Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in late June 2023 and confirmed by NASA in early July. Following its detection, astronomers began tracking its trajectory through the solar system. The comet passed near Mars on October 3, 2023, and is set to reach its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023.</p>
<p>In the coming years, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey toward interstellar space, with a predicted close encounter with Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We have found that none of the stars in the solar neighborhood can explain the trajectory and high velocity of 3I/ATLAS,” said Xabier Pérez-Couto, lead study author and postgraduate student at Universidade da Coruña in Spain.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique characteristics include being the largest interstellar object observed and having the highest recorded speed. Previous studies of interstellar objects have provided limited insights into their origins, making 3I/ATLAS a significant subject of research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations from Earth, Mars, and spacecraft near Jupiter are planned to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS. Scientists aim to study its composition to gain insights into its cosmic birthplace and the early history of the Milky Way.</p>
