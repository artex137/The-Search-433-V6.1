      <h2>UFOs Allegedly Interfere with Nuclear Weapons, Claims Documentary</h2>

<p>Marco Rubio, a senior U.S. official, has claimed that Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) may have the ability to switch nuclear weapons on and off. This allegation was made public in the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, which began streaming on Prime Video on November 21. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to these claims.</p>

<p>This revelation raises significant concerns regarding national security and government transparency. Authorities are now faced with questions about the extent of UAP interactions with sensitive military sites and the implications for public safety and oversight.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> released on November 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>Marco Rubio, 54, is a prominent U.S. diplomat and senator.</li>
    <li>Over 1,600 UAP sightings logged by the Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office in the past four years.</li>
    <li>Three public hearings held by U.S. Congress featuring military whistleblower testimonies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, the U.S. government has shifted from denying the existence of UAPs to acknowledging their presence. The Pentagon has documented over 1,600 sightings. In 2023, three public hearings were convened, where military personnel shared their experiences with UAPs. On November 21, 2023, Marco Rubio made significant allegations in the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, claiming that UAPs have interfered with U.S. nuclear capabilities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities – and it's not ours,”</blockquote>
<p>said Marco Rubio in the documentary.</p>
<blockquote>“This was pretty shocking to hear someone of Rubio's level making that allegation,”</blockquote>
<p>said Dan Farah, producer and director of the documentary.</p>
<blockquote>“For someone of Rubio's level to make that accusation in public with such certainty says a lot about what's been kept secret for decades from everyone – and, apparently, even the president,”</blockquote>
<p>stated Dr. Bill Birnes, a best-selling author on the subject.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, the topic of UAPs has been met with skepticism, often dismissed as conspiracy theories. However, recent government actions, including the establishment of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, indicate a shift towards transparency. The acknowledgment of UAPs and public hearings mark a significant change in how the U.S. government addresses these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations continue, officials are expected to assess the implications of Rubio's claims on national security and government oversight. Further public hearings may be scheduled to address these concerns and provide clarity on UAP interactions with military assets.</p>
