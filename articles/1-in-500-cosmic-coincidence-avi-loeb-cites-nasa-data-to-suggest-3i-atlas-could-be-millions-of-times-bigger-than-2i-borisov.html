      <h2>1-in-500 cosmic coincidence? Avi Loeb cites NASA data to suggest 3I/ATLAS could be millions of times bigger than 2I/Borisov</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a scientist from Harvard, has analyzed recent NASA data regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it could be millions of times larger than the previous interstellar comet 2I/Borisov. The observations were made by NASA's SPHEREx space observatory between August 8 and August 12. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This analysis matters as it challenges existing theories about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb argues that the absence of a water cloud and other characteristics of the object indicate that it is not a natural space rock but potentially an artificial construct, possibly sent by extraterrestrial beings. NASA is currently reviewing the implications of these findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observations by NASA's SPHEREx: August 8–12</li>
    <li>Mass loss rate: approximately 70 kilograms per second</li>
    <li>Diameter of 3I/ATLAS: 46 kilometres</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun during observations: 2.5 AU</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar comet: 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li>Loeb's claim of random orientation: 1 in 500 chance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between August 8 and August 12, NASA's SPHEREx space observatory conducted observations of 3I/ATLAS. During this period, scientists noted a significant mass loss and the absence of a water cloud. Loeb published his analysis shortly after, outlining his theories based on the data obtained.</p>

<p>Loeb has previously claimed that interstellar objects should exhibit certain characteristics, which he believes 3I/ATLAS does not. He argues that this discrepancy supports his theory that it is not a natural object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The latest images by SPHEREx do not resolve the dust coma contention,” Loeb stated in his blog post. “The sunlight scattered around it is compact and reflecting off the dust on it.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further asserted, “If this object is a space rock, then it is a million times bigger than the previous interstellar comet 2I/Borisov.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This analysis follows previous discussions about interstellar objects and their implications for understanding the universe. 2I/Borisov, the first confirmed interstellar comet, raised questions about the characteristics and origins of such objects. Loeb's claims about 3I/ATLAS add another layer to these discussions, suggesting that not all interstellar objects may be of natural origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to analyze the data collected from SPHEREx and consider the implications of Loeb's findings. Further observations may be planned to gather more information about 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory through the solar system.</p>
