      <h2>Interstellar comet eruption exposes organic compounds and brings clues about the origin of life</h2>

<p>A significant eruption from the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has revealed organic compounds that may provide insights into the origins of life. The event occurred in December 2025 as the comet approached the sun, allowing astronomers to analyze its internal makeup using NASA's high-precision instruments.</p>

<p>This discovery is crucial as it challenges existing theories about where the building blocks of life can be found in the universe. Researchers from various institutions, including the Laboratório de Física Aplicada at Johns Hopkins and Caltech, have begun to analyze the data collected during this rare event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas experienced a significant eruption in December 2025.</li>
    <li>The eruption released gases and dust containing methanol, cyanide, and methane.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx space telescope captured the data during the eruption.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is a visitor from another star system and has been inactive for billions of years.</li>
    <li>The comet's internal structure has preserved records of the formation of distant planetary systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, 3I/Atlas erupted, releasing a variety of organic compounds. The eruption allowed scientists to identify a distinct “chemical signature” that included essential elements for prebiotic chemistry. The comet remained inactive for billions of years before this event.</p>

<p>The eruption's timing was unusual as 3I/Atlas did not begin to release gas and dust until two months after its closest approach to the sun. This delay was attributed to thermal inertia, where heat took time to penetrate the comet's insulating outer layers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The eruption acted like the opening of a time capsule, allowing humanity to glimpse the raw materials of an alien star system in its purest form,” said a researcher from Caltech.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The detection of the ‘chemical cocktail’ offers concrete evidence about the complexity of interstellar chemistry,” noted experts from Johns Hopkins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The eruption of 3I/Atlas adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that the ingredients for life may exist beyond our solar system. Previous studies have indicated that comets and asteroids could transport water and organic compounds to barren planets, supporting theories of molecular panspermia.</p>

<p>The comet's behavior also challenges existing models of cometary activity, as it displayed a unique morphology in its dust tail, suggesting different processes in its home system compared to typical comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from the SPHEREx mission to further understand the chemical evolution of the Milky Way and assess the frequency with which solar systems develop habitable conditions.</p>
