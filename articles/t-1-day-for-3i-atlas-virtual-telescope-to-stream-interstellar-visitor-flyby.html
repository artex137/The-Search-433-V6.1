      <h2>T-1 Day For 3I/ATLAS: Virtual Telescope To Stream Interstellar Visitor Flyby</h2>

<p>In just a few hours, the comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth, scheduled for the early hours of Friday, 19th December. The comet, which is only the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, is currently travelling at a speed of 144,100 mph (232,000 km/h) and will be approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometres) from Earth at its nearest point.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it offers scientists and stargazers a rare opportunity to study an object from another star system. Authorities, including NASA, have organized efforts to observe and share this encounter with the public. The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a livestream of the flyby, allowing viewers to witness this celestial event from their homes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth for a flyby on 19th December.</li>
    <li>It will be about 168 million miles (270 million kilometres) from Earth at its closest point.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of 144,100 mph (232,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>A livestream of the event will begin at 11 p.m. EST on Thursday (0400 GMT on Friday).</li>
    <li>The comet reached its perihelion on 30th October.</li>
    <li>Its next significant encounter will be with Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been on a trajectory towards Earth since its detection. It reached its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, on 30th October. Now, it is speeding away from the Sun and will pass Earth on 19th December before heading towards Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<p>The comet's unique characteristics have been studied extensively. Researchers have noted a 'wobbling jet' phenomenon, marking the first time the spin of an interstellar object has been directly measured. Observations have also revealed a vast X-ray glow around the comet, providing insights into its composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We very much want to find signs of life in our universe, but 3I/ATLAS is a comet,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya during a briefing in November.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third interstellar object detected in our solar system. Its behaviour resembles that of comets formed in our solar system, despite its alien origins. The comet's activity has sparked interest in understanding the dynamics of interstellar objects and their interactions with solar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its flyby, 3I/ATLAS will continue on its path out of the solar system, with its next significant encounter at Jupiter in March 2026. Researchers will analyze data collected during the flyby to gain further insights into the comet's properties and origins.</p>
