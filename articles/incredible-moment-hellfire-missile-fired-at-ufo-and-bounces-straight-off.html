      <h2>Incredible moment 'hellfire missile' fired at ‘UFO’ and bounces straight off</h2>

<p>Dramatic footage captured by a US drone shows a bright, shiny 'UFO' being struck by a missile off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024, only to continue its journey unaffected. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the incident.</p>

<p>This event has drawn significant attention as it coincided with a US Congress hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), the new term for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The hearing included various videos from military and navy personnel, but one video stood out, showing the missile impact on the unidentified orb.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Type of missile: AGM-114 Hellfire</li>
    <li>Captured by: American MQ-9 drone</li>
    <li>Reported by: Representative Eric Burlison</li>
    <li>Witness: US Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 drone captured footage of a bright orb off the coast of Yemen. The drone fired a Hellfire missile at the orb, which reportedly bounced off without effect. This incident was highlighted during a US Congress hearing on UAPs, where various military videos were presented.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Representative Eric Burlison discussed the footage, expressing the need for transparency regarding such incidents. Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins also shared his own experience with an unusual object while serving on the USS Jackson in 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "A Reaper drone fired a Hellfire missile at this thing. And the missile didn’t seem to have any effect," said Representative Eric Burlison, according to News Nation.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "What I observed and what our crew recorded was not consistent with conventional aircraft or drones," stated Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins during the hearing.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader discussion on UAPs, which has gained momentum in recent years. Earlier this year, US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard stated that extraterrestrial life "cannot be ruled out," urging serious investigation into unexplained objects in US skies.</p>

<p>The recent Congressional hearings have aimed to shed light on military encounters with UAPs, with many officials calling for increased transparency and research into these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident and the broader implications of UAP encounters are ongoing. Authorities have not disclosed any specific timelines for potential outcomes or further hearings related to these phenomena.</p>
