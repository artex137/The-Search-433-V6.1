      <h2>3I/ATLAS, rare interstellar comet, nears Earth this week</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to pass close to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet was first spotted in mid-2025 by the ATLAS survey and is only the third confirmed object from outside our solar system. Scientists are closely monitoring its trajectory as it approaches our planet.</p>

<p>This flyby presents a unique opportunity to study material from beyond our solar system. 3I/ATLAS has a bright coma and visible tail, typical of interstellar objects. Although it will be approximately 268.9 million kilometers away during its closest approach, it poses no risk to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in mid-2025.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 268.9 million kilometers away from Earth at its closest point.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object.</li>
    <li>European and American space agencies are collecting data on its behavior.</li>
    <li>Citizen scientists are encouraged to contribute telescope observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in mid-2025 by the ATLAS survey. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun in October 2025. As it nears Earth, astronomers are preparing to track its movement and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The flyby of 3I/ATLAS offers a once-in-a-lifetime observation opportunity that could provide new insights into distant planetary systems,” said a spokesperson from a leading space agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS are extremely rare, with only two confirmed prior to this comet. They carry material not formed in the solar system, allowing scientists to study distant materials and gain insights into the chemistry of other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its flyby, 3I/ATLAS will move toward Jupiter, where it is expected to become fainter and harder to observe over time. Astronomers will continue to track its trajectory and behavior following the close approach. Charts and ephemeris data will assist in locating the comet for observations.</p>
