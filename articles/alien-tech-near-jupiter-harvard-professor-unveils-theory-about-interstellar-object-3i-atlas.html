      <h2>Alien Tech Near Jupiter? Harvard Professor Unveils Theory About Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A Harvard astronomer has proposed a controversial theory regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is set to pass near Jupiter in March 2025. The object, first detected in 2017, has garnered significant attention due to its unusual behavior and is expected to approach Earth in early 2026.</p>

<p>This theory, presented by Avi Loeb, raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb speculates that the object may not be a natural comet but instead an alien probe. His claims have sparked both intrigue and skepticism within the scientific community, prompting discussions among researchers and space agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First Detected:</strong> 2017</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Distance from Jupiter:</strong> 160,000 miles</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> September 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Earth Approach:</strong> Early 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in 2017 and has since been the subject of various studies. In September 2024, the object made its closest approach to the Sun, which altered its trajectory.</p>
<p>As it heads towards Jupiter, 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass within 160,000 miles of the planet in March 2025. This trajectory has led Loeb to propose that the object may be deploying technological devices around Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “If we find technological satellites of Jupiter that we did not send, it would imply that Jupiter is of interest to an extraterrestrial civilization.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s associate administrator, has dismissed Loeb’s claims, stating, “3I/ATLAS is a natural comet made up of ice and dust.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb’s theory contrasts with NASA's position, which maintains that 3I/ATLAS's unusual acceleration is due to the Sun’s radiation and outgassing. The scientific community remains divided on the possibility of extraterrestrial technology in relation to the object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, continued observation and study will occur. Researchers will monitor the object’s behavior and trajectory to gather more data on its nature and origin.</p>
