      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Ignites Curiosity and Wonder</h2>

<p>On 20th September 2025, astronomers have observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, a celestial body from beyond our Solar System, captivating the scientific community since its initial sighting in June 2025. The comet, distinguished as an interstellar object, has sparked significant interest due to its unique origins and composition.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS matters for several reasons. It offers valuable insights into the characteristics of interstellar objects, which differ from those originating within our Solar System. The comet has been closely monitored by the James Webb Space Telescope and other astronomical instruments, providing detailed data that enhances our understanding of the cosmos. As it approaches the Sun, Earth, and Mars in the coming months, the potential for further observations by spacecraft presents a unique opportunity for researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Initial sighting of 3I/ATLAS occurred in June 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet detected by ATLAS, an automated early warning system established by the University of Hawaii.</li>
    <li>ATLAS operates a network of four telescopes located in Hawaii, Chile, and South Africa.</li>
    <li>Comet contains water ice, water vapour, carbon monoxide, and carbonyl sulfide.</li>
    <li>Observations have been made using the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is not expected to be captured in the Sun’s orbit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The journey of 3I/ATLAS began in the summer of 2025 when ATLAS detected the comet. This early warning system is designed to identify celestial threats to Earth by continuously scanning the night sky. Following its detection, astronomers have used advanced instruments to study the comet's composition and trajectory.</p>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has become the subject of extensive observation, with major telescopes focusing on its path as it travels through our Solar System. The comet is expected to pass near the Sun, Earth, and Mars within the next few months.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS provides invaluable knowledge about interstellar objects,” said a representative from the University of Hawaii. “Its composition sheds light on the differences between spacerocks from distant star systems and those from our own.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS reflects advancements in astronomical technology and monitoring systems. The ATLAS network, which employs a technique similar to the one used to discover Pluto in 1930, has significantly enhanced our ability to track celestial bodies. This discovery is part of a broader trend in space exploration focused on understanding the origins and characteristics of objects from beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will conduct further observations. Plans are in place for potential studies involving Mars rovers and orbiters, which could provide more data on this interstellar visitor.</p>
