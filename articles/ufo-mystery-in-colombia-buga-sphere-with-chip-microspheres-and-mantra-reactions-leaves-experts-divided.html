      <h2>UFO Mystery In Colombia: Buga Sphere With ‘Chip’, Microspheres and Mantra Reactions Leaves Experts Divided</h2>

<p>A metallic object known as the “Buga Sphere” has sparked global interest after its discovery near Buga, Colombia, in March 2025. The orb reportedly flew erratically before crashing to the ground, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported. Witnesses described its unpredictable movements prior to landing in a rural area.</p>

<p>The Buga Sphere has gained attention due to its unusual construction and alleged connections to alien technology and advanced physics. Authorities are investigating the object, which has become a subject of both scientific inquiry and paranormal speculation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: March 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Near Buga, Colombia</li>
    <li>Initial observations: Erratic flight pattern before crashing</li>
    <li>Weight: Increased from 16 pounds to 22 pounds over time</li>
    <li>Investigating researchers: Jaime Maussan, Dr. Carlos Muñoz, Rodolfo Garrido</li>
    <li>Alleged physical effects: Grass and soil die-off at landing site</li>
    <li>Response to Sanskrit mantras: Reported vibration and light changes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2025, witnesses reported seeing the Buga Sphere flying erratically before it crashed in a rural area near Buga, Colombia. Following its recovery, researchers began examining the object, revealing a seamless metallic surface with complex internal wiring. In July 2025, viral videos emerged showing the sphere allegedly reacting to Sanskrit mantras.</p>

<p>Researchers noted unusual properties, including changes in weight and unexplained physical effects at the landing site, leading to debates about its origin and function.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object appears capable of transmitting and receiving signals based on the complexity of its internal structure,” said engineer Rodolfo Garrido.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It seems kind of like an art project,” stated cognitive neuroscientist Julia Mossbridge, expressing skepticism about its extraterrestrial origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Buga Sphere has become part of a larger conversation regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the potential for advanced technology beyond current human understanding. Previous incidents involving unidentified objects have raised questions about their origins, leading to ongoing investigations by various scientific communities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and researchers continue to investigate the Buga Sphere, focusing on its physical properties and potential implications for technology and science. Further analysis and testing are expected to provide more insights into the object’s nature and capabilities.</p>
