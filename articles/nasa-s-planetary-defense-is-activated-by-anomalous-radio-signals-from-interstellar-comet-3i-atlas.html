      <h2>NASA’s planetary defense is activated by anomalous radio signals from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The international scientific community has activated monitoring protocols after detecting unusual radio emissions from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently approaching the solar system. The signals were captured by a global network of radio telescopes, prompting NASA’s Gabinete of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária (PDCO) to intensify its observation efforts. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it raises questions about the nature of the signals, which differ from typical emissions expected from comets. Authorities are mobilizing resources to investigate the origin of these emissions and to ensure a coordinated global observation campaign. The findings could provide crucial insights into the geology of exoplanets and the conditions of planet formation in other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Frequency of Emissions:</strong> 1.6 GHz</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> In the coming months</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> End of 2026, approximately 270 million kilometers away</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies Involved:</strong> NASA, ESA, MeerKAT, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, Very Large Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The initial detection of radio emissions occurred at an unspecified time by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. This was subsequently confirmed by facilities including the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico. As the comet approaches the solar system, NASA's PDCO has activated enhanced monitoring protocols.</p>

<p>Observations are being conducted using multiple telescopes, including the Very Large Telescope in Chile and the Hubble Space Telescope, which are focused on analyzing the comet's composition and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The alert serves to coordinate a global observation campaign,” said a PDCO representative. “We are mobilizing all available resources to understand the nature of this unusual behavior.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in the solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS exhibits a composition suggesting an origin in a stellar system rich in complex organic compounds, based on preliminary analyses.</p>

<p>The detection of structured radio emissions in a relatively quiet band of the cosmic radio spectrum has drawn parallels to searches conducted in programs aimed at detecting extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA plan to continue their observation campaign as the comet becomes more active. Scientists aim to analyze the data collected from the comet to determine the nature of the radio signals, whether they arise from natural phenomena or require deeper investigation. The collaboration between international observatories will be essential in solving this cosmic puzzle.</p>
