      <h2>Manhattan-sized interstellar object is covered in a layer of CO2, shocking scientists, NASA images reveal</h2>

<p>A Manhattan-sized interstellar object, identified as 3I/ATLAS, has been found to be covered by a layer of carbon dioxide, according to recent images captured by the James Webb Space Telescope and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory observatory SPHEREx. The object was first spotted in the skies above Chile nearly two months ago and is currently traveling through Earth’s inner solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery has raised significant interest among scientists and astronomers. Experts have noted that the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by 3I/ATLAS is much higher than expected for a typical comet. Harvard astrophysicist Avie Loeb has highlighted that this unusual characteristic could indicate that the object was intentionally designed to target the inner Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately 12 miles (19 kilometers) wide</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at Closest Approach: About 130 million miles (209 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>CO2 Emission: 16 times more than typical comets at the same distance from the Sun</li>
    <li>Location of Discovery: Above Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in the skies above Chile nearly two months ago. Recent imaging by the James Webb Space Telescope and SPHEREx has revealed its carbon dioxide cloud. The object is expected to come closest to Earth on October 30, 2025, although it will pass behind the Sun at that time, hindering observation efforts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The H2O mass loss rate is only 5% of the CO2 output. This is 16 times more extreme than expected for a typical comet at the same distance from the Sun,” said Avie Loeb in a Medium post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“A relatively thin outer layer is sufficient to maintain the observed cloud of CO2 gas around 3I/ATLAS. What lies under this outer skin remains unknown,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, Loeb had suggested that the likelihood of an interstellar object of this size traveling close to Earth is extremely low, at fractions of a percent. The absence of a comet-like tail in 3I/ATLAS further supports his hypothesis that the object is not a typical comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition. The passing behind the Sun during its closest approach presents challenges for observation, but researchers plan to analyze data collected from previous images.</p>
