      <h2>Unprecedented detection of nickel in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS by the VLT in Chile</h2>

<p>International astronomers have detected atomic nickel vapor in the atmosphere of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was observed on July 20, 2025, at a distance of 3.88 astronomical units (AU) from Sol. The detection occurred using the Very Large Telescope's X-shooter and UVES spectrographs in Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides critical data on the chemical composition of materials from another star system. The observation may enhance understanding of the processes that govern the formation of celestial bodies and the evolution of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system.</li>
    <li>Initial detection of nickel vapor occurred on July 20, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet follows a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is scheduled for October 29, 2025, with a minimum distance from Sol estimated to be close to 2 AU.</li>
    <li>Nickel emission became significant by July 23, 2025, at 3.78 AU.</li>
    <li>Observations involved 11 visits with X-shooter and two with UVES.</li>
    <li>Contributing scientists hail from Chile, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and Italy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, during a routine sky survey. Following its discovery, astronomers began monitoring the comet as it approached Sol. On July 20, 2025, they detected nickel vapor in the comet's atmosphere using advanced spectrographs. By July 23, 2025, the detection of nickel became significant, indicating increasing production of nickel atoms as the comet neared the sun. By mid-August, the distance to the comet had reduced to 3.07 AU, and the presence of cyanogen was also recorded.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of nickel in the atmosphere of 3I/ATLAS at such low temperatures is unprecedented,” said a representative from the international team. “This discovery opens up new avenues for understanding the chemical processes in interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is the third such object identified in the solar system. Previous interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov and 'Oumuamua, have highlighted variations in chemical compositions, providing insights into the differences between solar and interstellar materials. The detection of nickel without simultaneous detection of iron in 3I/ATLAS raises questions about the chemical processes at play.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The international team will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. They expect new chemical species to emerge with warming and will coordinate observations using terrestrial and space-based telescopes. The comet is anticipated to leave the solar system after perihelion, contributing valuable data for studies of distant exoplanetary systems.</p>
