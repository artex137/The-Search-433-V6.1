      <h2>Intense brightness of 3I/ATLAS reveals unprecedented details during rare solar opposition for astronomers</h2>

<p>A rare astronomical event has placed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS prominently in the skies, reaching its solar opposition phase on January 22, 2026. This alignment has intensified its brightness, enabling detailed observations of its unique features. The event occurs when a celestial body is positioned directly opposite the Sun from the Earth's perspective, receiving full illumination.</p>

<p>This rare solar opposition is significant for astronomers as it presents an opportunity to study the third interstellar object ever identified. The coordinated observation by various agencies and observatories aims to gather crucial data about the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS. Understanding these details can provide insights into the origins of bodies traveling between stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of solar opposition:</strong> January 22, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 2025, at about 1.4 astronomical units</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery by:</strong> ATLAS telescope system in July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Expected approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Greater than 50 km/s relative to the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope system. The object made its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, in October 2025. Following this, it began its outward journey, passing near Earth's orbit in December 2025. The solar opposition on January 22, 2026, marked a peak in brightness, allowing for extensive observation and data collection. The object is expected to approach Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The opposition phase was the best opportunity to study the object’s so-called anti-tail, a dust structure that appears to point toward the Sun from our perspective,” said astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University, emphasizing the importance of this event for understanding 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS has exhibited complex and active behavior. Observations have revealed mini-jets of material and a growing tail, which are atypical for comets in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey into interstellar space, astronomers will analyze data collected from ground-based and space-based telescopes. The results are expected to be published in the coming months, aiming to address questions raised by its unusual characteristics and enhance our understanding of celestial bodies in our galaxy.</p>
