      <h2>An interstellar comet is showing off for astronomers</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently speeding through the solar system at over 137,000 miles per hour, captivating astronomers with its unique characteristics. The comet was first observed on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, approximately 410 million miles from the sun, near Jupiter’s orbital path. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this celestial event.</p>

<p>This comet's discovery is significant as it is only the third interstellar object identified, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Scientists are studying its unusual composition, which contains more carbon dioxide than water, and its increasing size as it approaches the sun. The comet poses no risk to Earth, as its trajectory will take it safely past both the planet and the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at over 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>First observed on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Currently located approximately 410 million miles from the sun.</li>
    <li>Will come within 130 million miles of the sun in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Will reach a distance of 168 million miles from Earth in mid-December 2025.</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter between 0.4 and 3.5 miles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. At that time, it was approximately 410 million miles from the sun. As astronomers monitored its trajectory, they noted its speed and increasing tail size.</p>

<p>In late October 2025, the comet is expected to approach within 130 million miles of the sun, just inside the orbit of Mars. By mid-December 2025, it will come as close as 168 million miles from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The composition of Comet 3I/ATLAS is unusual in that it is made up much more of carbon dioxide than water,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Its trajectory will send it harmlessly past both Earth and the sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as it adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed in our solar system. The previous discoveries of ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have sparked interest in the study of celestial bodies from other star systems.</p>

<p>This comet's unique characteristics provide valuable insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects, enhancing our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun and Earth. Further observations will provide additional data on its composition and trajectory.</p>
