      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Harvard Scientist Claims It Could Be Alien Tech</h2>

<p>NASA announced the discovery of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025. This comet has become the third known object to enter our solar system from beyond the stars. NASA confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, but its unusual characteristics have sparked debate among scientists. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet might be a product of alien technology.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it challenges current understanding of celestial bodies and their origins. Researchers are investigating its properties to determine whether it is a natural phenomenon or an engineered object. Observations will continue as the comet makes its closest approach to the Sun on October 29-30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29-30, 2025</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately 12 miles wide</li>
    <li>Speed: Over 130,000 mph (58 km/s)</li>
    <li>Emission: Four grams of nickel per second</li>
    <li>Presence of nickel tetracarbonyl detected</li>
    <li>Trajectory: Hyperbolic, not gravitationally tied to the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA announced the discovery of 3I/ATLAS. Initial observations revealed its strange emission patterns and peculiar trajectory. As scientists analyzed its chemical composition, they noted the absence of iron and the presence of nickel tetracarbonyl. These findings have led to discussions regarding the possibility of alien technology.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, researchers are preparing for detailed observations using spacecraft like NASA's Psyche and ESA's JUICE. These missions aim to gather more information about the comet’s properties and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The unusual chemical signature might be evidence that the object contains manufactured or engineered materials, strengthening the alien-tech hypothesis.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also noted, “The tail flipping to point away from the Sun could indicate controlled movement or maneuvering, possibly by an intelligent source.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique characteristics have prompted scientists to reevaluate what is known about interstellar objects and their potential origins. The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS may offer new insights into the nature of materials found in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches the Sun, scientists will closely monitor its activity. Observations from upcoming spacecraft will help determine whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural celestial body or something engineered, potentially reshaping our understanding of the universe.</p>
