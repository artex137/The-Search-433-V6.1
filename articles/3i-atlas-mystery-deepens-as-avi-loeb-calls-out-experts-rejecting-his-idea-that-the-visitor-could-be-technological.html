      <h2>3I/ATLAS mystery deepens as Avi Loeb calls out experts rejecting his idea that the visitor could be technological</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object detected on July 1, 2025, from Hawaii, has sparked significant debate among scientists regarding its nature and origin. The object is only the third known visitor from outside the solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019, and has exhibited unusual behavior that has puzzled researchers.</p>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the dismissive attitude of many scientists who classify 3I/ATLAS simply as a comet. Loeb argues that the object’s strange characteristics, particularly its anti-tail, warrant further investigation. He has published 11 research papers on the subject and has criticized comet experts and NASA officials for their lack of curiosity regarding these anomalies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS first detected on July 1, 2025, from Hawaii.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has identified at least 13 unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Loeb has published 11 research papers discussing the object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025. Since its discovery, scientists have noted its atypical behavior compared to standard comets. Avi Loeb has since highlighted these peculiarities, particularly the presence of an anti-tail, and has criticized the scientific community for not considering alternative explanations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb expressed his frustration, stating, "The real problem is that some experts refuse to look at new ideas because they believe they already know the answer."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community has historically been skeptical of unconventional theories regarding celestial objects. Previous interstellar visitors, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have also generated debate, but 3I/ATLAS's behavior presents unique challenges that could reshape understanding of cometary phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and studies of 3I/ATLAS are anticipated as researchers seek to understand its origins and characteristics. Avi Loeb continues to advocate for an open-minded approach to the object’s analysis.</p>
