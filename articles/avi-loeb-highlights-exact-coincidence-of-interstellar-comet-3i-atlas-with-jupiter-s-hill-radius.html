      <h2>Avi Loeb highlights exact coincidence of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with Jupiter’s Hill radius</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist and director of Projeto Galileo, has reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will pass within 53.445 million kilometers of Jupiter on March 16, 2026. This trajectory aligns closely with Jupiter's Hill radius, a significant detail calculated by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>

<p>The alignment of comet 3I/ATLAS with Jupiter's Hill radius is notable because it suggests an unusual non-gravitational influence on its trajectory. Authorities at NASA are currently monitoring the comet's approach, using various telescopes to study its characteristics and chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, at 53.445 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Initial perihelion occurred on October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Comet exhibits an acceleration of 5×10<sup>-7</sup> AU/day² measured during perihelion.</li>
    <li>Probability of alignment with Jupiter's Hill radius is approximately 1 in 26,000.</li>
    <li>NASA telescopes, including James Webb and TESS, are conducting spectroscopic analyses.</li>
    <li>Comet will make a minimum approach of 1.8 AU to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 2 PM UTC.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2025, early activity of 3I/ATLAS was detected via TESS images. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, at 1.4 AU from the Sun. Telescopic observations confirmed its activity in July 2025, with instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope noting the development of a coma and tail. On March 16, 2026, the comet will pass within 53.445 million kilometers of Jupiter, coinciding with its Hill radius.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The precision at the radius of Hill suggests a non-random influence on the comet's trajectory,” said Avi Loeb, emphasizing the significance of this alignment.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the third confirmed interstellar comet, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The unusual composition of 3I/ATLAS, including high levels of nickel and low water content, has raised discussions about its origins, possibly from a dry protoplanetary disk. Previous studies have noted that alignments like this are rare in hyperbolic trajectories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring the comet's approach and will conduct detailed spectroscopy to analyze its chemical composition. The European Space Agency's JUICE mission will also adjust its trajectory for imaging during the comet's orbital encounter in March 2026.</p>
