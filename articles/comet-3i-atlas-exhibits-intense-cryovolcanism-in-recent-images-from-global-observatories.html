      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas exhibits intense cryovolcanism in recent images from global observatories</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has displayed signs of intense cryovolcanic activity, as documented by researchers through observations between November and December 2025. The comet, which is at its closest proximity to Earth, has shown spiral jets of gas and dust expelled from its surface, interpreted as eruptions of ice volcanoes.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances understanding of the comet’s characteristics and its origins from outside the Solar System. NASA has classified 3I/Atlas as an active comet, confirming that there is no risk of collision with Earth. The comet will reach its minimum distance from Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas travels at a speed exceeding 200,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, approximately 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Minimum approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2025, at 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet has exhibited an abrupt increase in brightness, seven times greater than expected for similar objects.</li>
    <li>International campaigns are mobilizing telescopes such as Hubble, Gemini, and Joan Oró until January 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet’s journey began with its discovery on July 1, 2025. Initial observations revealed a diffuse coma and an incipient tail shortly after its detection. The perihelion on October 29, 2025, marked the point of closest proximity to the Sun, leading to an unexpected increase in brightness.</p>

<p>In October 2025, 3I/Atlas passed within 28 million kilometers of Mars, followed by an approach to Venus in November. Observations have continued as the comet nears Earth, with significant data collected by various space and ground-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of cryovolcanism in an interstellar object indicates that similar processes may occur on icy bodies beyond the Solar System,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike these previous objects, 3I/Atlas retains a primitive composition, never subjected to intense thermal cycles. This characteristic, along with its high metallic content, challenges traditional models of cometary formation and suggests a greater diversity in distant protoplanetary disks.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/Atlas will continue until the comet fades in 2026, before it exits the Solar System. International efforts are ongoing to gather data and analyze the comet’s unique characteristics.</p>
