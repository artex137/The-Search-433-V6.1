      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I-ATLAS: Latest Images Unveiled Before Its Closest Approach to Earth</h2>

<p>The Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has captured the attention of astronomers and space enthusiasts as it approaches Earth later this month. Fresh images from the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed details of the comet, which was first discovered in July traveling through our solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object observed speeding through our solar system. Authorities have mobilized numerous missions to study the comet, aiming to gather insights about its composition and trajectory. The gases released during its close approach to the Sun in October have provided valuable information to researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Hubble Space Telescope captured images on November 30, 2025, when the comet was approximately 286 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA has conducted over 20 missions to study the comet.</li>
    <li>Amateur astronomers captured images of 3I/ATLAS on December 2, 2025, from Farm Tivoli, Namibia.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to remain visible for several more months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed by the Hubble Space Telescope in July 2025 shortly after its discovery. The comet's unique teardrop shape was noted during this initial observation.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2025, Hubble captured clearer images of the comet from a distance of 286 million miles. This marked a significant moment in the ongoing study of the comet as scientists began to analyze the gases emitted during its approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>On December 2, 2025, amateur astronomers Gerald Rhemann and Michael Jager photographed the comet using a 12-inch telescope in Namibia.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA has shared findings from over 20 missions to provide the most detailed understanding so far of this icy traveler from another star system,” a NASA representative stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed by astronomers, enhancing our understanding of the composition and history of celestial bodies from other star systems. The comet offers a unique opportunity to study material that predates our own solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, utilizing data from various missions to further understand its properties and trajectory. The comet is expected to remain visible for several months, allowing for ongoing observation and analysis.</p>
