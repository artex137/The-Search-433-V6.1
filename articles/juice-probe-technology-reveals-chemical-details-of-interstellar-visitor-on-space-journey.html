      <h2>Juice probe technology reveals chemical details of interstellar visitor on space journey</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed the successful collection of scientific data from comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object, during its journey toward the Jupiter system. The data was obtained using the Submillimetre Wave Instrument (SWI) on board the Juice spacecraft, which is currently scheduled to reach Jupiter in July 2031.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it allows researchers to study the chemical composition of 3I/Atlas, providing insights into the formation of objects from beyond our solar system. ESA officials have stated that the findings underscore the probe's technological capabilities, particularly in adapting to unexpected targets during its mission.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas analyzed by Juice probe during its journey to Jupiter.</li>
    <li>SWI captured emissions revealing chemical details of the comet.</li>
    <li>Juice was launched in April 2023 and is set to arrive at Jupiter in July 2031.</li>
    <li>Next key flybys include Earth in September 2026 and January 2029.</li>
    <li>Juice will conduct detailed studies of Jupiter's moons, including Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Juice was launched in April 2023. The spacecraft successfully performed a flyby of Venus in August 2025 to adjust its orbit. Future flybys include Earth in September 2026 and January 2029, which will assist in gaining speed for its journey to Jupiter.</p>

<p>The SWI instrument has demonstrated its ability to analyze unexpected celestial bodies, yielding significant data about 3I/Atlas during its transit through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The opportunity to study an object of this nature with cutting-edge instrumentation is considered a significant scientific bonus,” an ESA spokesperson said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Unlike periodic comets that orbit the Sun, interstellar bodies like 3I/Atlas carry material from other star systems. They serve as time capsules, preserving the chemistry of distant locations in the galaxy. The Juice mission aims to deepen understanding of gas giants and their moons, with relevance to the study of exoplanets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA continues to process data from the SWI instrument and other sensors on the Juice spacecraft, with ongoing analysis expected to yield new insights as the mission progresses toward Jupiter.</p>
