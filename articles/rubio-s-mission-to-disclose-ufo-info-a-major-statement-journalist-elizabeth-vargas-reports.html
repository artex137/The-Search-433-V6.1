      <h2>Rubio’s mission to disclose UFO info a ‘major statement’: Journalist</h2>

<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has pushed for the U.S. government to disclose information about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during an appearance on “Elizabeth Vargas Reports.” Journalist Michael Shellenberger discussed Rubio's efforts, stating that an adviser has informed him the secretary believes the U.S. has recovered alien technology.</p>
