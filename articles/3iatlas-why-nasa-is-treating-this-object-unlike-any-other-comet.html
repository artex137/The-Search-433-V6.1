      <h2>NASA Plans Live Event to Reveal New Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has scheduled a live event for Wednesday, 19 November, at 3 p.m. EST to present new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered by the ATLAS observatory earlier this year. This comet is notable as only the third verified celestial body to have entered our solar system from another part of the Milky Way galaxy, according to NASA.</p>

<p>The live broadcast aims to provide a detailed overview of 3I/ATLAS and its significance in understanding interstellar objects. NASA plans to showcase visual data collected by various missions while highlighting the comet’s unique characteristics that set it apart from typical comets. The event will take place at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> 19 November</li>
    <li><strong>Event Time:</strong> 3 p.m. EST</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Designation:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> By the ATLAS observatory in 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Type:</strong> Interstellar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has tracked numerous comets over decades but has chosen to approach 3I/ATLAS differently due to its unique characteristics. This comet was discovered earlier in 2023, and its trajectory brought it close enough for detailed observation by various NASA programs.</p>
<p>On 19 November, NASA will broadcast live images and discuss the comet's features, marking a significant moment in the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Tomorrow's reveal isn't business as usual. It's the beginning of real answers,” said a user on X, noting the unusual treatment of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“NASA does not convene live briefings for standard comets,” commented another user, indicating the significance of this event.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS stands out from typical comets due to its unusual features and behavior, leading to speculation about its origins. Previous interstellar objects have been observed, but the treatment of 3I/ATLAS has raised questions about its nature and potential implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the live event, NASA will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS to further understand its characteristics and implications for interstellar research.</p>
