      <h2>A long-overdue release: NASA still holding HiRISE images</h2>

<p>NASA has not yet released images of comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in early October 2025. The images, taken when the comet was approximately 29 million kilometers from Mars, could provide crucial insights into this interstellar visitor.</p>

<p>The delay in releasing these images has raised concerns among scientists and the public, with calls for transparency increasing following the recent U.S. government shutdown. Avi Loeb, a prominent astrophysicist, has emphasized the importance of these images for understanding the comet's behavior and characteristics. He argues that rigid thinking within the scientific community may hinder progress in this field.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images captured on October 2–3, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was 29 million kilometers from Mars at the time of imaging.</li>
    <li>Image resolution is 30 kilometers per pixel.</li>
    <li>Public interest has surged, with figures like Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna advocating for the release.</li>
    <li>Earth-based observatories resumed tracking 3I/ATLAS as of November 11, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2-3, 2025, NASA’s HiRISE camera captured detailed images of comet 3I/ATLAS. The images have not been released to the public, prompting frustration from the scientific community and the public. By November 11, 2025, Earth-based observatories were able to track the comet as its angular separation from the Sun increased.</p>

<p>The public's interest in 3I/ATLAS is evident, with conversations about the comet extending even into everyday scenarios, such as home repairs, reflecting its impact on popular imagination.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Scientific data should never be held hostage by politics,” said Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, urging NASA to release the HiRISE images.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We should be considering alternative explanations, like the possibility of propulsion systems,” Avi Loeb stated, challenging traditional comet theories.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing body of research into interstellar objects. Previous comets, such as 1I/`Oumuamua, have displayed unusual characteristics that have sparked debate within the scientific community. Loeb criticizes the tendency to dismiss non-traditional findings as merely typical comet behavior.</p>

<p>The ongoing investigation into 3I/ATLAS highlights a broader trend in the scientific community towards questioning established norms and encouraging curiosity-driven research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has yet to announce a timeline for the release of the HiRISE images. As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, the demand for transparency and scientific inquiry remains high.</p>
