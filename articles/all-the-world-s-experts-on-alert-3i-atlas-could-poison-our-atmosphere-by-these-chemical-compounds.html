      <h2>All the world's experts on alert - 3I/Atlas could poison our atmosphere by these chemical compounds</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently being monitored by scientists as it travels through our solar system. The comet has captured the attention of astronomers at major observatories including the Keck II, Hubble, and James Webb due to its unusual chemical composition, which includes large amounts of nickel and cyanide. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This situation matters because the unique properties of 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the formation of celestial bodies and the early solar system. Authorities and scientists have emphasized that while the comet's chemical composition raises questions, there is no imminent threat to Earth from the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently traveling through the solar system.</li>
    <li>It contains large amounts of nickel and cyanide, which is unusual for comets.</li>
    <li>The comet has a distinctive anti-tail, which is not commonly observed.</li>
    <li>It will pass far from Earth, not even touching Earth's orbit.</li>
    <li>Scientists have noted that cyanide is common in comets, but its intensity in 3I/ATLAS is surprising.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed as it travels through the solar system, with scientists studying its properties using advanced telescopes. As the comet approaches, astronomers have reported its unusual chemical makeup, prompting discussions about its potential impact on Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>While many theories circulate regarding the comet's nature, scientists have confirmed that it poses no risk to Earth. The comet is expected to continue its journey through space after passing by our planet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no risk to Earth from 3I/ATLAS. It will pass at a safe distance,” said an astronomer at the Keck Observatory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The intensity of cyanide in this comet is surprising, but it is not a threat,” stated a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of comets have often revealed the presence of cyanide, but the unique combination of elements in 3I/ATLAS has intrigued scientists. This comet is a rare opportunity to study primitive systems in our solar system, as it originates from a distant region and likely predates the formation of Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the solar system. Observations will focus on understanding its chemistry and behavior, contributing to our knowledge of celestial bodies and their origins.</p>
