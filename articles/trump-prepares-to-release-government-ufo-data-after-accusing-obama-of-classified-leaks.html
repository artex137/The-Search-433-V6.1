      <h2>Trump prepares to release government UFO data, after accusing Obama of classified leaks</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has pledged to begin the process of identifying and releasing government files related to aliens, extraterrestrial life, and unidentified flying objects, following his accusations against former President Barack Obama of leaking classified information during a podcast. This announcement was made on Thursday, although no specific timeline for the release has been disclosed.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention due to the public's long-standing interest in UFOs and government transparency regarding extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including the Pentagon, have previously conducted investigations into UFO sightings and activities, with Congress holding public hearings on the topic in 2022.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump announced plans to release UFO-related government files on Thursday.</li>
    <li>Obama was accused by Trump of revealing classified information regarding aliens.</li>
    <li>In 2022, Congress held public hearings on UFOs.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon established an office to investigate UFOs in 2022.</li>
    <li>A report released by the Pentagon in 2024 stated no evidence of extraterrestrial beings or technology was found.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2022, Congress conducted public hearings on UFOs, prompting increased scrutiny of government records related to unidentified aerial phenomena. Later that year, the Pentagon set up an office dedicated to investigating these sightings.</p>

<p>In 2024, the Pentagon published a report concluding that it "has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology." This report has led to ongoing discussions among scientists and the public about the existence of life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>On Thursday, President Trump made his pledge to release related government files, following comments made by Obama during a podcast where he discussed aliens.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He gave classified information. He's not supposed to be doing that,” President Trump said, referring to comments made by Obama.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us... Really!” Obama clarified on Instagram.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If the government tells us that there are anomalies that they cannot figure out, it is the duty of scientists like myself to help them figure it out,” said Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist leading a Harvard project on extraterrestrial life.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The public's fascination with UFOs and potential extraterrestrial life has a long history, with significant interest growing in recent years. The establishment of the Pentagon's office to investigate UFOs reflects a shift towards greater transparency and acknowledgment of these phenomena. The 2024 Pentagon report has sparked debate among experts about the possibility of undisclosed evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into UFOs are expected as the Pentagon continues its work. The timeline for the release of the files promised by Trump remains unclear, and updates from the government on any new findings are anticipated.</p>
