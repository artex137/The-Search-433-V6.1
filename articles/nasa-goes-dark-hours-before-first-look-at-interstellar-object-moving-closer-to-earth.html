      <h2>NASA goes dark hours before first look at interstellar object moving closer to Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has ceased operations just hours before the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS makes its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. The object will come within 18 million miles of the Red Planet, marking its nearest flyby of any planet this year. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it may provide crucial insights into the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which scientists believe is an unusual comet from a distant solar system. Two space probes, Mars Express and ExoMars, are poised to capture detailed images and scans of the object. However, due to a government shutdown that began on October 1, NASA will not update its website or provide announcements during this period.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass within 18 million miles of Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object was discovered by an amateur astronomer during the summer of 2025.</li>
    <li>Mars Express and ExoMars have begun observing 3I/ATLAS on October 1.</li>
    <li>NASA's website will not be updated during the government shutdown.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may be over three miles long, but NASA estimates it could be as small as 1,444 feet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 1, 2025, Mars Express and ExoMars commenced their observations of 3I/ATLAS. The object is scheduled to make its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. The government shutdown began on October 1, restricting NASA's ability to provide updates.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Hopefully, we will learn much more about 3I/ATLAS in the coming days,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. “The image and composition would be the top two findings of interest.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It is clearly a natural comet; suggestions to the contrary are laughed at by people who are actual comet experts,” stated Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest since its discovery, primarily due to its unusual characteristics. A study from Michigan State University revealed that the object was emitting gas or dust long before approaching the sun, a behaviour not typical for distant comets. Avi Loeb has suggested that the object's anomalies raise questions about its origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency are expected to gather high-resolution images and spectral data during the flyby. These findings may help clarify the object's composition and trajectory, but further updates will be limited due to the ongoing government shutdown.</p>
