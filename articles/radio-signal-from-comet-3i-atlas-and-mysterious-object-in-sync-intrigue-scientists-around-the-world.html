      <h2>Radio signal from comet 3I/Atlas and mysterious object in sync intrigue scientists around the world</h2>

<p>A series of anomalous events involving the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has captured the attention of the global astronomical community since late 2025. On December 3, 2025, observatories across multiple continents detected a 12-second radio pulse emitted from the comet, aimed directly at Earth. The signal was recorded at a frequency of 1420 MHz, which is significant in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, coinciding with a burst of luminosity that made the comet shine four times brighter than normal.</p>

<p>This discovery raises questions about the physical processes at play in celestial bodies. Authorities from major space agencies, including NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and the Agência Espacial Chinesa, have begun a coordinated investigation into the event, while limiting public access to data related to the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: December 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Signal duration: 12 seconds</li>
    <li>Frequency of signal: 1420 MHz</li>
    <li>Brightness increase: Four times normal luminosity</li>
    <li>Detection locations: Alemanha, Brazil; Nova Zelândia; Estados Unidos</li>
    <li>Discovery of 3I/Atlas: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance between 3I/Atlas and secondary object: Approximately 120 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was officially discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS astronomical survey system in Chile. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its interstellar origin. Following a period of solar occultation, the comet reappeared in early December 2025, during which it exhibited unprecedented brightness and emitted a radio pulse on December 3.</p>

<p>Minutes after the radio pulse was detected, an electromagnetic echo was recorded on Earth, marking an unusual interaction with the comet. Data analysis indicated a complex geometric structure in the radio signal, revealing six hexagonal shapes. This pattern coincided with images of the comet's surface, suggesting organized internal processes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are in the process of verifying data regarding the radio pulse and its implications,” a spokesperson from NASA stated. “The coordinated response reflects the seriousness with which we are treating this phenomenon.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event is unprecedented in the study of comets and interstellar objects. Previous anomalies, such as the 2007 comet 17P/Holmes, took significantly longer to reach similar peak brightness. The rapid and orderly nature of the brightness increase in 3I/Atlas presents challenges to existing cometary models and theories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the interaction between 3I/Atlas and the secondary object are ongoing. Space agencies are expected to release further findings as data analysis progresses, while public access to real-time data remains restricted.</p>
