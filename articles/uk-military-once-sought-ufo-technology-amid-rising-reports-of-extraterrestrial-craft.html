      <h2>UK Military Once Sought UFO Technology Amid Rising Reports of “Extraterrestrial” Craft</h2>

<p>Previously undisclosed documents from the UK Ministry of Defence reveal that the military actively investigated unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) during the 1990s. The reports emerged from files released at the National Archives in Kew and were reported by Times UK.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it highlights the military's serious consideration of UAPs as potential advanced technology that could outmaneuver known aircraft. The Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) noted that reported sightings could pose a threat to national security and warranted further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documents released from the National Archives in Kew</li>
    <li>Investigation period: 1990s</li>
    <li>Key incidents: Belgium sightings (1989-1990), Rendlesham Forest incident (December 1980)</li>
    <li>DIS ceased UAP investigations in 2009</li>
    <li>Defence minister Luke Pollard stated no dedicated team currently studies UFO reports</li>
    <li>No evidence found that sightings over 50 years posed a military threat to the UK</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the 1990s, the UK military began investigating UAPs after reports of sightings increased. Notably, from 1989 to 1990, thousands of witnesses in Belgium reported large, silent, low-flying black triangles. In December 1980, US air force personnel reported a glowing craft landing near a base in Suffolk, known as the Rendlesham Forest incident. In 2009, the DIS officially ceased its investigations into UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Logic would indicate that if significant numbers are reporting seeing strange objects in the sky then there may be a basis in fact,”</blockquote>
<p>— Ministry of Defence memo, March 4, 1997</p>

<blockquote>“Whether terrestrial or extraterrestrial, further investigation was warranted.”</blockquote>
<p>— Ministry of Defence documents</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The newly released documents provide insight into a time when the British military considered UAP technology with the same seriousness as conventional weapons development. The DIS had acknowledged the potential for ridicule in pursuing such investigations but maintained that advances in science made the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe plausible.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, the Ministry of Defence has no plans for renewed investigations into UFO sightings, according to Defence minister Luke Pollard. The agency will continue to monitor any developments related to UAPs but has found no credible evidence of military threats from sightings over the past 50 years.</p>
