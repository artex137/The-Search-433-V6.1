      <h2>All you need to know as 'alien spaceship' 3I/ATLAS 'grows tail' pointed at the Sun</h2>

<p>A comet known as 3I/ATLAS has displayed an unusual feature, an 'anti-tail' pointing directly at the Sun, raising questions among astronomers. This phenomenon was highlighted after Austrian astrophotographer Michael Jäger released an image of the comet, which is approximately the size of Manhattan.</p>

<p>This discovery has garnered significant attention because it challenges existing theories about comet behavior. Authorities, including NASA, have responded to the claims surrounding 3I/ATLAS, asserting that it is merely a comet, despite ongoing discussions among experts about its unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Austrian astrophotographer Michael Jäger released the latest image of the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the comet's behavior.</li>
    <li>Nasa has held a conference to address rumors surrounding 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recently, astronomers have noted an unusual feature of comet 3I/ATLAS, specifically an 'anti-tail' directed toward the Sun. Michael Jäger's image prompted further analysis from experts. Avi Loeb has consistently warned that 3I/ATLAS behaves differently than typical comets, citing evidence of thrusters. In response to the growing speculation, NASA held a conference to clarify the nature of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object continues to defy the natural explanations expected of icy debris passing through our solar system,” said legal expert Samuel Lopez, who supports Loeb's claims.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS has sparked debates among scientists, with some suggesting it may not be a typical comet. Previous observations of unusual comet behavior have led to increased scrutiny and discussion among the astrophysics community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, experts will continue to analyze its characteristics and behavior, with further discussions anticipated in the scientific community.</p>
