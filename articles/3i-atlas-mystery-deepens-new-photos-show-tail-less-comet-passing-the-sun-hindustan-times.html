      <h2>3I/ATLAS mystery deepens; new photos show ‘tail-less’ comet passing the sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has puzzled scientists as recent images from the R. Naves Observatory in Spain, taken on November 5, show no visible tail, a typical feature of comets after they approach the Sun. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical phenomenon.</p>

<p>This discovery raises questions about conventional comet models, as astrophysicists highlight the lack of a tail as a significant anomaly. Experts are currently analyzing the implications of these findings and monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images taken on November 5, 2023, at R. Naves Observatory, Spain.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has brightened fivefold after perihelion.</li>
    <li>The object turned an unusual green hue and exhibited an “anti-tail” pointing toward the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS follows a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originates from outside the Solar System.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Orbiter's HiRISE camera is expected to capture additional images, currently delayed due to a government shutdown.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026, during which observations will be made by NASA and the European Space Agency.</li>
    <li>Initial entry into the solar system occurred on June 14, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its initial entry into the solar system. Following its perihelion, the object brightened significantly and displayed unique characteristics, including a green hue and an anti-tail. The latest images taken on November 5, 2023, revealed the absence of a typical cometary tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If 3I/ATLAS continues to show no tail, it is likely not a naturally-occurring comet,” said Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist from Harvard, in a report on Medium.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It exhibits non-gravitational acceleration, which requires massive evaporation of at least 13% of its mass, but preliminary post-perihelion images do not show evidence for it so far,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS challenges established theories regarding comet formation and behavior. Astrophysicists have noted similar anomalies in the past, but none have presented such a stark deviation from expected cometary characteristics. The comparison with comet Lemmon illustrates these differences, as Lemmon exhibited a standard tail facing away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in 2026. The release of new images from NASA’s Mars Orbiter will provide further insight into the object’s characteristics and behaviors.</p>
