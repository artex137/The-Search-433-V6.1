      <h2>Obama says aliens are ‘real, but I haven’t seen them’ in out-there new interview</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has stated that aliens are real during a podcast released on Saturday, but he has no knowledge of their whereabouts. In an interview with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cowen, Obama said, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them.” He did not provide further details or answer follow-up questions regarding his claims about extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>This statement has reignited public interest in the topic of UFOs and government transparency. Authorities have been increasingly releasing information about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), sparking discussions about potential extraterrestrial life and government secrecy surrounding the matter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Podcast released on February 14, 2026</li>
    <li>Interview conducted by YouTuber Brian Tyler Cowen</li>
    <li>Obama confirmed the existence of UAPs</li>
    <li>Obama previously commented on aliens during a 2021 interview</li>
    <li>Area 51 is a highly secretive Air Force base in Nevada</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2021, Obama appeared on “The Late Late Show” with James Corden, where he hinted at undisclosed information regarding aliens. He confirmed the legitimacy of UAP sightings and acknowledged that the government could not explain the origins or flight patterns of these phenomena.</p>
<p>In early February 2026, leaked radar footage from United States Air Force drones purportedly showed UAPs flying over the Middle East. This footage was shared by UFO researchers George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell, further fueling speculation about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When it comes to aliens, there are some things I just can’t tell you on air,” Obama said during the 2021 interview.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“But what is true — and I’m actually being serious here — is that there’s footage and records of objects in the skies that we don’t know exactly what they are,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in UFOs has surged in recent years, particularly following the release of unclassified Navy videos by the Pentagon in 2021. These videos depicted unusual objects moving through the air, captivating the public and prompting calls for more transparency from the government regarding UAP encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating UAP sightings and may release additional information in the future. There are no specified deadlines for these investigations at this time.</p>
