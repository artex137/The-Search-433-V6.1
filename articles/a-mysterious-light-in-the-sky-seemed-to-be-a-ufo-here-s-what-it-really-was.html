      <h2>A Mysterious Light in the Sky Seemed to Be a UFO — Here’s What It Really Was</h2>

<p>On the evening of August 12, residents in upstate New York observed a bright white light in the sky that they initially thought was a UFO. The unusual sight was later identified as the tail and plume of the Vulcan Centaur rocket, which launched from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.</p>

<p>This incident has drawn attention as many people speculated about the nature of the light, prompting local authorities and news outlets to clarify the situation. The Vulcan Centaur rocket is significant as it carries an experimental navigation satellite designed to provide data similar to that of a GPS system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date of sighting: August 12</li>
<li>Location: Upstate New York</li>
<li>Launch time of Vulcan Centaur rocket: 9 p.m. local time</li>
<li>Launch site: Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida</li>
<li>Rocket height: 202 feet</li>
<li>Satellite purpose: Experimental navigation, similar to GPS</li>
<li>Time since last military navigation satellite launch: 48 years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 12, around 9 p.m. local time, the Vulcan Centaur rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Residents of upstate New York began noticing a bright light in the night sky shortly thereafter. Speculation about a UFO circulated on social media as local news outlets reported on the sightings.</p>
<p>Officials quickly identified the light as being part of the rocket's tail and plume, dispelling the UFO theories. This launch marked the third successful flight of the Vulcan Centaur rocket.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The residents were observing the tail and plume of the Vulcan Centaur rocket,” a spokesperson from the United Launch Alliance (ULA) stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This launch is significant as it is the U.S. military's first experimental navigation satellite to be launched in 48 years,” the ULA added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Vulcan Centaur rocket is part of ongoing advancements in military navigation technology. The recent launch coincided with the peak of the Perseids meteor shower, a time when many stargazers are already looking to the sky, further contributing to the excitement and speculation surrounding the unusual light.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No further investigations are currently planned regarding the light as it has been confirmed to be from the Vulcan Centaur rocket. The ULA continues to monitor the performance of the satellite and its capabilities.</p>
