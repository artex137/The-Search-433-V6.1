      <h2>Chinese Tianwen-1 mission on Mars records unprecedented passage of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with details</h2>

<p>The Chinese probe Tianwen-1 has successfully recorded high-resolution images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed Mars in October 2025. The comet approached within approximately 30 million kilometers of the Red Planet, marking a significant achievement in space exploration.</p>

<p>This observation is important for the global scientific community, which aims to understand the composition and origin of celestial objects from distant star systems. The successful capture of 3I/ATLAS reinforces China's position in the space race and enhances the capabilities of the Tianwen-1 mission, which was originally designed for planetary mapping.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet's diameter is approximately 5.6 kilometers, moving at a speed of 58 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>The Tianwen-1 mission has been operational since reaching Martian orbit in February 2021.</li>
    <li>Other space agencies, including ESA and NASA, have contributed to the observation of the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet's tail expanded to 56,000 kilometers in August 2025 observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers identified comet 3I/ATLAS. Following this, the comet's trajectory was confirmed as hyperbolic, indicating its interstellar origin. In October 2025, the Tianwen-1 probe captured images of the comet as it passed Mars. The high-resolution camera, known as HiRIC, was recalibrated to track the fast-moving object. Data was transmitted back to Beijing for analysis.</p>

<p>As part of a global observation campaign, other agencies, including ESA's Mars Express and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, also focused their instruments on the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The successful adaptation of the HiRIC camera to deep-field astronomy demonstrates significant technical capability," said a representative from the Administração Espacial Nacional from China (CNSA).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This achievement represents the first time that an interstellar comet has been observed directly from the orbit of Mars,” the representative added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Tianwen-1 mission, launched in July 2020, is China's first interplanetary endeavor. It includes an orbiter, lander, and rover, with the Zhurong rover landing on Mars in May 2021. The mission has significantly advanced China's capabilities in deep space exploration.</p>

<p>Prior to this, the observation of interstellar objects has typically been conducted from Earth or space telescopes, making this achievement a notable milestone for Martian observation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The technologies and methodologies developed during the observation of 3I/ATLAS will inform future missions, particularly the Tianwen-2 mission, which aims to collect samples from an asteroid and later visit a comet in the main asteroid belt.</p>
