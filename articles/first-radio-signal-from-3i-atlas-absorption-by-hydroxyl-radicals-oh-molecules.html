      <h2>First Radio Signal from 3I/ATLAS Detected</h2>
<p>Researchers have detected the first radio absorption signal from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa on October 24, 2025. The telescope observed the object when it was 3.76 degrees from the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first successful detection of radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS. Authorities are now focused on further monitoring of the object to gather more data about its composition and behavior as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li>Angular separation from the Sun: 3.76 degrees</li>
    <li>Detected frequencies: 1.665 and 1.667 gigahertz</li>
    <li>Doppler velocity shifts: -15.59 (+/-0.16) and -15.65 (+/-0.17) kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Expected close approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Distance from Jupiter at closest approach: 53 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 20 and 28, 2025, MeerKAT attempted to detect radio signals from 3I/ATLAS but was unsuccessful. The solar conjunction of 3I/ATLAS occurred on October 21, 2025, when the object was near Earth's orbital plane. Successful detection of the OH molecules happened on October 24, 2025.</p>
<p>Following the detection, researchers plan to use the Juno spacecraft to search for additional radio signals from 3I/ATLAS during its close approach to Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This absorption signal constitutes the first radio detection of 3I/ATLAS,” said Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project and director at Harvard University’s Institute for Theory and Computation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been a subject of interest since its discovery due to its interstellar origin. Previous attempts to observe its radio emissions have not been successful until now, underscoring the challenges of studying such distant objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, with the Juno spacecraft scheduled to search for additional radio signals on March 16, 2026.</p>
