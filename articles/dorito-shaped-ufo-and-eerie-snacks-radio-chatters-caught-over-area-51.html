      <h2>'Dorito'-shaped UFO and eerie 'snacks' radio chatters caught over Area 51</h2>

<p>Bizarre military radio chatter and a triangle-shaped UFO sighting have been reported near Area 51, a top-secret military base in Nevada, on January 14, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting has sparked renewed interest in unidentified aerial phenomena, particularly triangle-shaped objects, as the National UFO Reporting Center has documented an increase in similar reports globally. The incident has drawn attention from UFO enthusiasts and researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Date of sighting: January 14, 2023</li>
  <li>Time of sighting: Approximately 3 a.m. local time</li>
  <li>Location: Near Area 51, Nevada</li>
  <li>Witness: Anders Otteson, a British backpacker and videographer</li>
  <li>Previous sightings: 85 reports of triangle-shaped UFOs since November 2025</li>
  <li>Researcher involved: Joerg Arnu</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 14, 2023, at around 1 a.m., Anders Otteson filmed a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber flying over Area 51, reportedly originating from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. Later that night, at approximately 3 a.m., he observed a triangle-shaped craft, described as a "Dorito," performing a low flyover in the same area.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Joerg Arnu, a fellow UFO researcher, intercepted unusual military radio chatter near Area 51. Instead of standard communication, personnel were heard using terms like "pretzel snack" and "Imperial with garlic."</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Twice in 2014, photographers caught the same Dorito-shaped object on camera, revealing that the craft looked nothing like the US military’s current stealth bomber planes or known drones,” said Otteson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Are we looking at a classified test flight or run-of-the-mill training sortie? I certainly think we have something interesting here,” Otteson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has a long history of being associated with the development and testing of advanced military aircraft, including the F-117 Nighthawk, America’s first stealth bomber. The recent surge in reports of triangle-shaped UFOs has prompted experts to investigate the possibility of manmade craft versus extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and UFO researchers are expected to continue monitoring reports of triangle-shaped objects and investigating the unusual radio chatter detected near Area 51. Further analysis of the sightings and communications may provide additional insight into these phenomena.</p>
