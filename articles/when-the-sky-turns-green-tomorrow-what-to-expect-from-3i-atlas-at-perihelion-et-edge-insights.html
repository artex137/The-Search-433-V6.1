      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Perihelion on October 29–30</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) will reach its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 29–30, 2025. This event marks the peak of its visibility and activity, although there are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS is significant for astronomers worldwide. Discovered in July 2025 by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, it is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed. Scientists are eager to study the comet’s unique characteristics and behavior as it passes through our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion on October 29–30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 5–10 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>It will pass 1.4 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, near Mars's orbit.</li>
    <li>The comet will be 1.8 AU (270 million km) away from Earth.</li>
    <li>Amateur astronomers in the Southern Hemisphere may observe it with medium to large telescopes.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of 58 km per second (130,000 mph) as it exits the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, marking a significant addition to our understanding of interstellar objects. It is now approaching its perihelion on October 29–30, 2025, where it will exhibit its brightest activity. Following this event, the comet will continue on its trajectory back into deep interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Everything we see so far can be explained by natural comet physics — outgassing, solar heating, and chemistry shaped by billions of years in interstellar space,” said Jason Wright, astrophysicist at Penn State.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is an emissary from interstellar space,” according to the University of Arizona, highlighting its importance as a cosmic messenger.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS is much larger and more active, providing a unique opportunity for scientists to study its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA) are using this flyby as a planetary defense exercise to improve tools for detecting and tracking interstellar bodies. New images from observatories are expected to be released in the coming days as the comet approaches perihelion.</p>
