      <h2>New images reveal strange object from beyond passing through our Solar System</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/Atlas has been observed in high-resolution images captured by the Gemini South telescope in Chile. First detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey, 3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed interstellar comet recorded.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the formation and composition of planetary systems beyond our own. Researchers are closely monitoring the comet as it approaches the Sun, with plans for further observations and analysis of its chemical makeup.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at 1.36 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Observed using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) at Gemini South, Chile.</li>
    <li>Images show a broad coma and a tail, indicating cometary activity.</li>
    <li>This object is only the third confirmed interstellar comet, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected 3I/Atlas using the ATLAS survey. Following its detection, the object has been the subject of various studies and speculation regarding its nature. On August 27, 2025, researchers used the Gemini South telescope to capture detailed images of 3I/Atlas, revealing its growing coma and tail.</p>

<p>As 3I/Atlas approaches the Sun, it becomes more active, releasing gas and dust as it warms. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Our main goals were to study the comet’s colors, which help reveal the size and makeup of its dust particles, and to get a direct look at its chemistry through spectra,” said Karen Meech, an astronomer at the University of Hawaiʻi. “We were excited to see the tail growing—indicating a shift in dust composition since earlier Gemini images—and to catch an early glimpse of its chemical profile.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are extraordinarily rare, with 3I/Atlas being only the third confirmed example. Unlike comets that orbit the Sun, 3I/Atlas travels on a hyperbolic path, which will eventually return it to interstellar space. The study of such objects provides a unique opportunity to understand materials formed around distant stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun and will conduct further analysis to learn more about its composition and origin. Future observations aim to enhance our understanding of interstellar materials and their implications for planetary system formation.</p>
