      <h2>Unusual radio signals from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS trigger global alert from NASA and ESA</h2>

<p>The international scientific community has mobilized to monitor the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS astronomical scanning system. The comet is the third confirmed interstellar visitor and is distinguished by its speed exceeding 100,000 kilometers per second. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The detection of anomalous radio emissions has raised the alert level, prompting NASA to activate its planetary defense protocols for intensive monitoring. The comet's passage presents a rare opportunity for scientists to analyze primordial material from another star system, and space agencies worldwide are collaborating to gather data during its transit through our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is traveling at speeds over 100,000 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>NASA has activated its planetary defense protocols.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Radio signals were captured by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>The emissions are consistent with hydrogen lines but are atypical in intensity and regularity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS astronomical scanning system identified 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar comet. Following this discovery, NASA activated its planetary defense protocols to monitor the comet closely.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected unusual radio signals from the comet at a frequency of 1.6 GHz. This prompted further investigation into the comet's characteristics and potential significance.</p>
<p>NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office has scheduled a press conference for August 2025 to present preliminary data and discuss the ongoing global observation campaign.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The emissions are compatible with hydrogen lines, but their intensity and regularity are atypical, drawing the attention of astronomers,” said a representative from the Agência Espacial Europeia (ESA).</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The interaction of cometary material with the solar wind could be the cause of the emissions,” noted an expert involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event marks a significant moment in the study of interstellar objects, following previous visitors like ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS provide new insights into the formation processes of celestial bodies in different stellar environments.</p>
<p>The collaboration between NASA and ESA enhances the international response to potential cosmic threats, facilitating the exchange of information and expertise.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Continuous monitoring of 3I/ATLAS will be crucial as it interacts with our solar system. Scientists will analyze the data collected to refine planetary formation models and improve strategies for tracking objects that may pose a threat in the future.</p>
