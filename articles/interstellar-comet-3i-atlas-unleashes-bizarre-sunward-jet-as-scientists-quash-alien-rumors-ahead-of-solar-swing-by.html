      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-26 22:25 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Unleashes Bizarre Sunward Jet as Scientists Quash Alien Rumors Ahead of Solar Swing-By</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, only the third confirmed interstellar object, has exhibited unusual behavior as it approaches the Sun, with a peculiar jet directed sunward. The comet was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile and is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29–30, 2025.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides scientists an opportunity to study the comet's unique characteristics, including its high carbon dioxide content and a strange “anti-tail.” NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have emphasized that the comet poses no threat to Earth, which is critical for public understanding amid speculation about its origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 29–30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Perihelion:</strong> 1.4 AU (130 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Will not come closer than 1.8 AU (270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 58 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> High CO₂/H₂O ratio (~8:1), low water ice, and venting nickel gas</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Campaign:</strong> Involves ESA Mars orbiters and NASA telescopes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. It has since been observed venting gas and dust, with Hubble capturing images of its teardrop-shaped coma in July. On October 3, 2025, the comet passed approximately 30 million km from Mars, where ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars TGO captured images during the flyby.</p>

<p>Leading up to its perihelion, scientists have noted the comet's unusual “anti-tail” jet, which has sparked public speculation regarding its origins. However, experts have rejected these theories, attributing the comet’s behavior to natural processes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth,” NASA confirmed, emphasizing its safe distance from our planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ESA scientist Dr. Michael Küppers stated, “3I/ATLAS looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet,” dismissing alien speculation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, this comet is more active, showcasing a visible coma and tail. Its unique features have triggered extensive observation and debate within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS nears perihelion, it will continue to be monitored by various space agencies. Following its closest approach to the Sun, the comet will exit the inner Solar System, crossing Jupiter’s orbit by March 2026.</p>
