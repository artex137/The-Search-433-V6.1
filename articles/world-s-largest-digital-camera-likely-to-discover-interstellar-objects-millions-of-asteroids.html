      <h2>World's largest digital camera likely to discover interstellar objects, millions of asteroids</h2>

<p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has detected the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, marking a significant milestone for the facility as it prepares to launch its 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time later this fall. The observatory, a $571-million project funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, is currently in its commissioning phase.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is notable as it highlights the capabilities of the world's largest digital camera. According to Ed Ajhar, the NSF Program Director for the Rubin Observatory, the telescope's potential to uncover interstellar objects could reshape our understanding of the cosmos. The observatory aims to capture an extensive astronomical movie of the Southern Hemisphere, which may include millions of asteroids over its operational life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Cerro Pachon, Chile</li>
    <li>Funding: $571 million from the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy</li>
    <li>Discovery of 3I/ATLAS: July 2023 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Current phase: Commissioning, set to begin the Legacy Survey of Space and Time in fall 2023</li>
    <li>First data release: June 2023, based on observations from November and December 2022</li>
    <li>Data processing: Takes approximately six months for calibration and processing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2023, the public received its first glimpse of the capabilities of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The telescope discovered thousands of asteroids during a few nights of imaging. In July, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was identified by ATLAS in Chile, prompting the Rubin team to investigate.</p>
<p>As the observatory prepares for its upcoming survey, it has also launched the Orbitviewer app, a 3D interactive tool designed to help users visualize data on solar system objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Are we gonna see one of those a year with Rubin, or a few over its 10 years, or 30, or we don't know,” said Ed Ajhar. “It'll be interesting to see how many of those are discovered.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It's just not releasing the data that comes off the telescope,” Ajhar added. “You have to calibrate the data.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS marks only the third known object of its kind to be tracked through our solar system in the past 20 years. The Rubin Observatory's advanced technology positions it to make significant contributions to the field of astronomy, with expectations to find millions of new asteroids over its operational period.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Rubin Observatory will continue its commissioning phase, with data releases expected to occur every year or every other year, depending on the processing requirements. Scientists anticipate that the data collected will enhance understanding of solar system dynamics and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
