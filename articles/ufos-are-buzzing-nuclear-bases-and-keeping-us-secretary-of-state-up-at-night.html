      <h2>UFOs are buzzing nuclear bases and keeping US Secretary of State 'up at night'</h2>

<p>The US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, has stated that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are reportedly buzzing nuclear bases, keeping him "up at night." This claim was made in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, which examines alleged sightings and government responses to UFO phenomena.</p>

<p>This matter has raised concerns among officials regarding national security and transparency. Rubio emphasized the importance of addressing these sightings, stating that even past presidents were informed on a "need to know" basis, with potential whistle-blowers fearing for their lives if they disclosed information.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Marco Rubio made the statement in a trailer for <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>.</li>
    <li>At least three UFO videos have been declassified for the film.</li>
    <li>The documentary is set for release on November 21 on Prime Video.</li>
    <li>Footage includes recordings by US Navy pilots from 2004 to 2015.</li>
    <li>One notable incident occurred in 1967 at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, where UFOs allegedly disabled nuclear missiles.</li>
    <li>The film examines an alleged 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since World War II, there have been numerous reports of UFO sightings, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1947: The military initially announced a "flying disc" crash in Roswell, New Mexico, later claiming it was a weather balloon.</li>
    <li>1967: A close encounter at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana involved UFOs allegedly disabling nuclear missiles.</li>
    <li>2004-2015: US Navy pilots recorded footage of unidentified aircraft making unusual maneuvers.</li>
    <li>2019: A Pentagon task force noted "unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft" in military zones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It would cost them their lives to speak out on the reports,” Rubio said, highlighting the risks faced by potential whistle-blowers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone,” said Luis Elizondo, former head of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary sheds light on a historical context of UFO sightings, dating back to reports of "foo fighters" by Allied pilots during WWII. These glowing orbs were noted for their unexplained movements and have contributed to suspicions of advanced surveillance technology. The defunct Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program previously investigated similar incursions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The documentary's release may prompt further investigations into UFO sightings and government responses, particularly regarding national security and public transparency on the matter.</p>
