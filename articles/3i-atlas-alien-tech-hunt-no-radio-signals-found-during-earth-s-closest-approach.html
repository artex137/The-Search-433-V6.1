      <h2>3I/ATLAS Alien Tech Hunt: No Radio Signals Found During Earth's Closest Approach</h2>

<p>On December 19, 2025, scientists reported no signs of radio signals from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach to Earth, which occurred at a distance of 167 million miles (1.7 AU). The comet has drawn considerable attention since its discovery in July 2025 due to its unusual chemical signature and erratic movements, leading some to speculate it could be an alien probe.</p>

<p>The search for potential technosignatures intensified as researchers prepared for the flyby. The Breakthrough Listen initiative utilized the 100-metre Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to scan for artificial emissions, but ultimately confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not broadcasting messages to any distant civilizations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 167 million miles (1.7 AU)</li>
    <li>Telescope used: Green Bank Telescope (GBT)</li>
    <li>Frequency range scanned: 1 to 12 GHz</li>
    <li>Initial signals of interest: nine events</li>
    <li>Final conclusion: no credible detections of narrowband radio technosignatures</li>
    <li>Comet's speed: 153,000 miles per hour</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 18, 2025, scientists conducted scans with the GBT in anticipation of the comet's flyby. Initial analysis revealed nine signals of interest. However, further investigation determined these signals were due to known patterns of human-made radio-frequency interference. By the time of the closest approach, the Breakthrough Listen initiative had officially reported a nondetection of any narrowband signals.</p>

<p>Following the flyby, high-resolution images from the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph confirmed the comet's characteristics, identifying it as an active icy comet rather than an artificial object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We find no credible detections of narrowband radio technosignatures originating from 3I/ATLAS,” the Breakthrough Listen team stated in their formal report.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet and all evidence points to it being a comet,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya during a press briefing after the US government shutdown ended.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been compared to the previously discovered interstellar object 1I/'Oumuamua, which exhibited unusual characteristics and lacked a visible tail. In contrast, 3I/ATLAS has shown typical cometary features, including an asymmetric coma and hydroxyl signatures indicative of water ice breakdown.</p>

<p>The recent observations have provided valuable insights into the composition of interstellar objects and reaffirmed that natural phenomena can exhibit complex behaviors that may initially be misinterpreted as technological signals.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey back into deep space, it is expected to pass the orbit of Jupiter by March 2026 and will begin to fade from view by 2028. Researchers plan to analyze the data collected during its flyby to enhance understanding of interstellar comets and their origins.</p>
