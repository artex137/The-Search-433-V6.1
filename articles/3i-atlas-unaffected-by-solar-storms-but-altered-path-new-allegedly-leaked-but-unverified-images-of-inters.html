      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Remains Unaffected by Solar Storms; Path Under Investigation</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has shown no signs of alteration due to recent solar storms, according to observations made since its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. New, allegedly leaked images shared online suggest its surface may be more solid than previously thought, although these claims remain unverified. Scientists are currently investigating whether the comet's trajectory has changed following its solar encounter.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS and planning further observations to determine its characteristics and any potential changes in its path.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>It reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's distance from Earth at its closest was approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>ESA’s JUICE mission will observe 3I/ATLAS between November 2 and 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate no tail or gas emissions from the comet despite solar activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by astronomers using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, NASA confirmed its hyperbolic orbit, indicating it is the third known interstellar object.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun. Observers noted the absence of a comet tail or gas emissions during this time. The comet also passed near Mars on October 2-3, 2025, at approximately 29 million kilometers.</p>

<p>New images surfaced online in early November 2025, allegedly showing the comet’s solid surface, but these claims have not been verified. The ESA's JUICE mission is set to collect data and images of 3I/ATLAS from November 2 to 25, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA-grade solar storms hit 3I/ATLAS — and it didn’t budge. No comet tail, no dust cloud. Either physics is lying or this thing is a solid chunk of metal and carbon sent from beyond,” stated a social media user discussing the comet’s stability.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another user commented, “If it didn’t release gas or dust, it might be made of dense material like metal or carbon,” suggesting a possible explanation for the comet's behavior.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Previous interstellar visitors have sparked interest among scientists for their potential to provide insights into the formation of planets and comets in different star systems.</p>

<p>The lack of gas emissions from 3I/ATLAS after solar exposure is unusual for comets, which typically display bright tails when approaching the Sun. This has led to increased scrutiny and discussion regarding its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely. The data collected from the JUICE mission, expected by February 2026, may provide further insight into the comet's activity and trajectory. Investigations into the claims surrounding its altered path and composition are ongoing.</p>
