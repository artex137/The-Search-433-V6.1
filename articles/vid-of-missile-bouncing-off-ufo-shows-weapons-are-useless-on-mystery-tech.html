      <h2>Footage of missile bouncing off UFO raises concerns</h2>
<p>Footage of a U.S. missile bouncing off an unidentified flying object (UFO) has sparked concerns about military readiness, according to a former Pentagon official. The video, released during a House Oversight hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, shows a U.S. Reaper drone launching a Hellfire missile at a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen, which then reportedly "bounced" off the object without any apparent effect.</p>

<p>This revelation matters as it raises questions about the effectiveness of advanced military technology against unknown aerial phenomena. U.S. officials have not verified the footage, but it has prompted discussions about national security and the need for transparency regarding unidentified aerial threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video released on October 24, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Missile type: AGM-114 Hellfire</li>
    <li>Drone type: MQ-9 Reaper</li>
    <li>Hearing held by the House Oversight Committee</li>
    <li>Witnesses included former Pentagon official Lue Elizondo and journalist George Knapp</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2024, a U.S. Reaper drone tracked a glowing orb over Yemen and launched a Hellfire missile at it. Video footage of this event was released during a congressional hearing on October 24, 2024. The missile appeared to bounce off the orb without causing any damage, leading to significant discussion among lawmakers and witnesses about the implications for U.S. military capabilities.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Representative Eric Burlison showcased the video and described it as “startling evidence” of a potential threat. Witnesses expressed their concerns about the implications of such technology on national security.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is some sort of technology that is making our premiere missile system completely and utterly useless,” said Lue Elizondo, a former Pentagon insider.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “What the hell is that?” asked journalist George Knapp, referring to the orb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “A Reaper drone fired a Hellfire missile at this thing, and the missile didn’t seem to have any effect,” stated Representative Eric Burlison.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader discussion about Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) and the U.S. government's efforts to investigate such occurrences. Previous reports have indicated that there are multiple incidents involving unidentified objects, but many remain classified or undisclosed to the public. The recent hearing has intensified calls for transparency regarding these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>U.S. officials have not indicated any immediate plans for further investigation into the specific incident off Yemen, but the release of the video may prompt additional scrutiny of UAP and military capabilities in future congressional hearings.</p>
