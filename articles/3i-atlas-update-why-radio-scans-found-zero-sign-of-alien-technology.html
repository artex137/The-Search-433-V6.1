      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Why Radio Scans Found Zero Sign of Alien Technology</h2>

<p>A comet known as 3I/ATLAS has passed through our solar system, with its closest approach occurring on December 19, 2025. The comet, first observed by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile on July 1, 2025, has generated interest due to its age and the data it has provided, though recent scans have found no evidence of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unique characteristics, including its estimated age of up to 14 billion years. Authorities and researchers are now analyzing the data collected during the comet's journey to understand its chemistry and behavior, particularly in comparison to local comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun, or perihelion, on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 AU.</li>
    <li>Water shedding rate estimated at 3.17 x 10<sup>29</sup> molecules per second on November 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet passed Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometres on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Radio scans conducted by the Breakthrough Listen project on December 18, 2025.</li>
    <li>No technosignatures detected down to the 100 mW level.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has provided significant data since its initial observation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>July 1, 2025:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is first observed by ATLAS in Chile.</li>
    <li><strong>October 29, 2025:</strong> The comet reaches perihelion, coming within 1.36 AU of the sun.</li>
    <li><strong>November 6, 2025:</strong> Water shedding rate estimated at 3.17 x 10<sup>29</sup> molecules per second.</li>
    <li><strong>December 8, 2025:</strong> Shedding rate decreases to between 1 and 2 x 10<sup>28</sup> molecules per second.</li>
    <li><strong>December 18, 2025:</strong> Breakthrough Listen project scans for technosignatures.</li>
    <li><strong>December 19, 2025:</strong> 3I/ATLAS passes Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometres.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every 'ping' detected was eventually traced back to mundane human technology and radio interference,” said lead researcher Ben Jacobson-Bell regarding the radio scans. </blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb noted peculiar features in Hubble images, emphasizing the need for further scrutiny of the comet's geometry.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the third recorded instance of an interstellar comet visiting our solar system. 3I/ATLAS's characteristics, including a rich chemical signature of carbon dioxide and atomic nickel, provide a unique opportunity for astronomers to compare it with local comets and understand potential variations in water behavior across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS to gain insights into its origins and behavior. Further studies may also explore the unusual features noted in Hubble images to determine their significance.</p>
