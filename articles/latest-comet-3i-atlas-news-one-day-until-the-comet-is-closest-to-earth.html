      <h2>Latest Comet 3I/ATLAS news: One day until the comet is closest to Earth!</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, reaching a distance of 168 million miles (270 million kilometers). There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers and space enthusiasts as it provides a rare opportunity to study a comet from outside our solar system. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, and not an alien spacecraft, dispelling various theories circulating about its origin. Observers can watch the flyby live online on December 18 and 19, depending on weather conditions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest point: 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Live webcast hosted by Gianluca Masi: December 18 at 11 p.m. EST (0400 GMT on December 19)</li>
    <li>Comet's current distance from Earth (as of December 17): 166.9 million miles (268.6 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by astronomer Larry Denneau at the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy while reviewing data from the ATLAS telescope. It gained attention for its interstellar origin, becoming the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</p>

<p>On November 2025, NASA held a press conference to clarify misconceptions about the comet, confirming that all evidence indicates it is a comet, despite various theories claiming otherwise. As of December 17, 2025, the comet was approximately 166.9 million miles from Earth, closing in on its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet. But this one came from outside the solar system, which makes it fascinating, exciting and scientifically very important," said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya during a press briefing.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of two previous interstellar objects, 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each of these objects has provided unique insights into the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from outside our solar system. The study of 3I/ATLAS is expected to enhance our understanding of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will monitor its trajectory and characteristics. Observers can expect updates and additional insights during the live webcast on December 18 and through ongoing studies after the flyby.</p>
