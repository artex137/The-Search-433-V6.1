      <h2>UN confirms planetary defenses will observe interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it races through our solar system</h2>

<p>The United Nations (UN) has confirmed that Earth's planetary defenses will observe the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, starting November 27, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides a unique opportunity for scientists to track the comet over a two-month period. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has organized this campaign, which is the eighth of its kind since 2017. The UN stated that while 3I/ATLAS poses no threat, it allows the scientific community to exercise their capabilities in measuring comet positions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The observation campaign begins on November 27, 2025, and lasts for two months.</li>
    <li>This is the eighth IAWN observing exercise since 2017.</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet with no signs of extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>Recent images of the comet have been captured by amateur astronomers worldwide.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025. On November 19, NASA released images from its Mars spacecraft, confirming the object's identity as a comet. On November 21, amateur astronomer Paul Craggs captured a clear image of the comet while it was visible over North America. Subsequent images were taken by other amateur astronomers in Japan, Spain, and Chile between November 22 and November 24.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, a senior NASA official, stated, "We want very much to find signs of life in the universe... but 3I/ATLAS is a comet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The IAWN has been conducting annual observing exercises since 2017 to prepare for potential asteroid threats. The current campaign for 3I/ATLAS was planned well in advance, indicating the UN's proactive approach to planetary defense.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The observation campaign will proceed as planned, with scientists monitoring 3I/ATLAS over the next two months to gather data and enhance their understanding of comet behavior.</p>
