      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with unstable orbit mobilizes NASA’s global planetary defense network</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its global planetary defense network in response to the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has an unstable orbit. The comet was first detected in 2019 and is currently approaching the inner solar system, with its path raising concerns among astronomers and planetary defense experts.</p>

<p>This mobilization is significant as it underscores the potential risks posed by interstellar objects. NASA has coordinated with various international space agencies to monitor the comet and assess any potential threats to Earth. The agency aims to enhance its preparedness for future encounters with similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently approaching the inner solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA has activated its global planetary defense network.</li>
    <li>International space agencies are involved in monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>The specific trajectory of the comet is classified as unstable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2019, astronomers first identified comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, it has been under closer observation due to its unpredictable orbit. Recently, as it approaches the inner solar system, NASA has taken proactive measures to assess its trajectory and potential impact.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS is crucial for understanding our solar system and beyond,” said a NASA spokesperson. “We are committed to ensuring the safety of our planet through rigorous monitoring and collaboration.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects, following the detection of ‘Oumuamua in 2017. NASA has implemented policies to improve planetary defense capabilities, including international cooperation and advanced monitoring technologies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS and collaborate with international partners to evaluate its trajectory. Further updates will be provided as new data becomes available.</p>
