      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS confirms Einstein—then defies expectations</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object currently traversing our solar system, has confirmed a key aspect of Einstein's theory of general relativity while also presenting unexpected anomalies. Observations of the object near the Sun have revealed a significant deviation in its path, challenging current understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it not only validates a major scientific theory but also raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS itself. Scientists are now investigating the object's unusual properties and what they may indicate about interstellar objects more broadly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed near the Sun on October 29.</li>
    <li>A gravitational lensing effect was observed, confirming Einstein's predictions.</li>
    <li>The object shifted by about four arcseconds, exceeding the predicted 0.27 arcseconds.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS brightened unexpectedly and appeared bluer than typical comets.</li>
    <li>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has raised questions about the object's classification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been tracked as it approached the Sun, with key observations made on October 29 during its closest approach. Initial data confirmed Einstein's predictions regarding gravitational lensing, but subsequent observations revealed deviations that scientists had not anticipated.</p>

<p>Following the perihelion event, astronomers noted the object's unusual brightness and coloration, which diverged from expected cometary behavior. These findings have prompted further investigation into the object's characteristics and classification.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The scale of the shift is not small: one arcsecond equals 1/3600 of a degree—about the size of a dime viewed from over two miles away,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the significance of the observations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Without evidence of a gas cloud or dust trail, the object might not be a standard comet,” Loeb noted in his blog post, emphasizing the need for a reevaluation of assumptions about interstellar objects.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects has gained momentum since the first confirmed detection of such a body, ‘Oumuamua, in 2017. The peculiarities of 3I/ATLAS add to the ongoing discussion regarding the origins and classifications of these objects.</p>

<p>As scientists continue to observe and analyze interstellar objects, the discoveries could reshape understanding of cosmic phenomena and the nature of materials found beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS to determine its composition and behavior. The findings may lead to new insights into the characteristics of interstellar bodies and their impact on existing astronomical theories.</p>
