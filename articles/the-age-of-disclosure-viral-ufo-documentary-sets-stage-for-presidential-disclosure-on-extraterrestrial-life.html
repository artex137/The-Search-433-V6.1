      <h2>The Age of Disclosure: Viral UFO Documentary Sets Stage for Presidential Disclosure on Extraterrestrial Life</h2>

<p>The Age of Disclosure, a documentary focused on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), premiered in select theatres and on Amazon Prime on November 22, 2025. The film has quickly gained attention both in the United States and internationally, featuring interviews with thirty-four officials from the U.S. government, military, and intelligence sectors.</p>

<p>Director Dan Farah has stated that the world is on the brink of a significant announcement regarding extraterrestrial life. The documentary discusses an alleged eighty-year cover-up of non-human intelligence and the competition among nations to reverse-engineer advanced technologies from beyond Earth. Farah has suggested that the film could lead to a sitting president publicly acknowledging the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>
