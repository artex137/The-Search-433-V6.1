      <h2>Golden Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) Is A Chemical Rarity – And It Should Have Been Destroyed!</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has surprised astronomers by not only surviving its close passage to the Sun on October 8, 2025, but also changing color from green to a rare golden hue. The comet, discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), was expected to disintegrate during its approach, which occurred at a distance of 49 million kilometers (31 million miles) from the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it highlights the unpredictable nature of comets and their behavior as they approach the Sun. Authorities and astronomers are now focusing on observing the comet's unusual characteristics, which could provide insights into the composition and behavior of comets originating from the Oort cloud.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) passed within 49 million kilometers (31 million miles) of the Sun on October 8, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has changed color from green to a golden hue, as observed by astrophotographer Dan Bartlett.</li>
    <li>It has reached a brightness of magnitude 9, making it visible with binoculars or a small telescope.</li>
    <li>Comet K1 (ATLAS) will make its closest approach to Earth on November 24, 2025, at a distance of 60 million kilometers (37.3 million miles).</li>
    <li>It will be visible for most of the night from the Northern Hemisphere, near the constellation Ursa Major.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2025, initial observations revealed Comet K1 (ATLAS) to be carbon-poor, a rarity among comets. On October 8, 2025, the comet passed within 49 million kilometers of the Sun, a point at which many similar comets typically disintegrate. Contrary to expectations, K1 (ATLAS) survived this close encounter and exhibited a color change to a golden hue.</p>
<p>Following its perihelion, the comet brightened to magnitude 9, allowing for easier observation. Astrophotographers have captured its distinctive appearance, including a golden ribbon-like tail influenced by solar wind.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is very common for these comets to disintegrate as they get close to the relentless light of the Sun. But K1 (ATLAS) lived to fight another day,” said an unnamed astronomer.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet K1 (ATLAS) is part of a remarkable year for comets, with several bright comets, including C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) and 3I/ATLAS, currently visible. The behavior of K1 (ATLAS) adds to the intrigue surrounding comets from the Oort cloud, particularly those with unusual chemical compositions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet K1 (ATLAS) approaches Earth for its closest passage on November 24, 2025, astronomers will continue to monitor its behavior and characteristics. Observations will help determine the implications of its unique chemical composition and color change.</p>
