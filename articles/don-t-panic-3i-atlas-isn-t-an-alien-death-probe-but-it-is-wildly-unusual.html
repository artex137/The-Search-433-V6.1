      <h2>Don't Panic! 3I/ATLAS Isn't an Alien Death Probe, But It Is Wildly Unusual</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has not broken apart, and reports suggesting it may be an alien probe have been dismissed by scientists. Observations confirm its natural, cometary origin, despite its unusual composition. The comet was discovered on 1 July 2025 and has been the subject of speculation regarding its characteristics.</p>

<p>This discovery matters to planetary scientists and the public alike, as it provides insight into the unique nature of interstellar objects. Authorities continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely as it travels through the Solar System, with plans for further observations, including potential close encounters with the Juno spacecraft in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Initial observations indicated high nickel abundance and unusual carbon dioxide levels.</li>
    <li>Radio signals were detected by the MeerKAT radio telescope array in South Africa on 24 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet is estimated to have formed approximately 11 billion years ago.</li>
    <li>Upcoming close observation opportunity with Juno in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>1 July 2025: 3I/ATLAS is discovered, sparking interest and speculation about its origins.</p>
<p>24 October 2025: MeerKAT radio telescope records radio signals from the comet, confirming expected sublimation processes.</p>
<p>Early November 2025: Claims arise regarding the comet breaking apart, which are widely contested by scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All the images I've seen show a fairly ordinary/healthy-looking comet. There's no sign at all that the nucleus broke apart.” - Qicheng Zhang, cometary scientist at Lowell Observatory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Of Loeb's 10 anomalies, only 4 really have planetary scientists interested: the high nickel abundance, the extreme polarization, the strange water abundance, and the rapid brightening.” - Jason Wright, astronomer at Penn State.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is not the first interstellar object to generate speculation. Previous objects, such as 1I/'Oumuamua, have also been subjects of debate regarding their origins and nature. The scientific community has consistently aimed to clarify these claims through observation and analysis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System, with a focus on upcoming observations by the Juno spacecraft in March 2026.</p>
