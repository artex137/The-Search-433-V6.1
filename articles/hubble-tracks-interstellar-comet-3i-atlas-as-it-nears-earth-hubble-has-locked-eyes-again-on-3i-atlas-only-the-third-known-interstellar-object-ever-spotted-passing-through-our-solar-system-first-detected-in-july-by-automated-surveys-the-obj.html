      <h2>Hubble Tracks Interstellar Comet 3I ATLAS as It Nears Earth</h2>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has observed interstellar comet 3I ATLAS as it approaches Earth, marking it as only the third known interstellar object detected in our solar system. The comet was first detected in July 2023 by automated surveys and has gained significant attention from astronomers worldwide.</p>

<p>The recent observations are crucial as they provide valuable data about the comet's composition and behavior. Hubble's latest findings come after the comet reemerged from behind the Sun in early November, allowing scientists to better analyze its activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS was first detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Hubble observed the comet on November 30, 2023, from approximately 286 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth will be at about 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I ATLAS has high levels of carbon dioxide, low water content, and traces of atomic nickel vapor.</li>
    <li>European Space Agency (ESA) is coordinating multiple observations from various missions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2023: Automated surveys first detect comet 3I ATLAS.</p>
<p>Early November 2023: The comet reemerges from behind the Sun, increasing its visibility and activity.</p>
<p>November 30, 2023: Hubble observes 3I ATLAS, documenting intensified outgassing and its unusual chemical profile.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The goal is simple. Learn as much as possible before it is gone,” said an ESA representative regarding the comet's observation efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS is notable not only for being an interstellar visitor but also for its unique chemical composition. Previous interstellar objects have provided insights into the materials found in other star systems, making this observation particularly significant for ongoing astronomical research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, it is expected to cross Jupiter’s orbit by spring 2024 and will likely fade from view by the end of the decade. Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected to further understand its properties and origins.</p>
