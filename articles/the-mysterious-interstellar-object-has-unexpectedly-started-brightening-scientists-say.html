      <h2>The Mysterious Interstellar Object Has Unexpectedly Started Brightening, Scientists Say</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported that comet 3I/ATLAS has unexpectedly brightened as it approaches its closest point to the Sun, which occurred on October 29, 2023. The object, first spotted in early July, is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system.</p>

<p>This brightening is significant as it may provide insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are currently monitoring 3I/ATLAS using solar observatories, as Earth-based observations will not resume until early December when the comet reemerges from behind the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object has been traveling at approximately 137,000 mph.</li>
    <li>It was first detected in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>Observations are being conducted by NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), the European Space Agency’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s GOES-19.</li>
    <li>Earth-based observatories will be unable to track 3I/ATLAS until early December 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in early July 2023. It traveled through the solar system at a high velocity, reaching its perihelion on October 29, 2023. During this close approach, scientists observed an unexpected increase in brightness.</p>

<p>Following its perihelion, the comet will not be visible from Earth until early December 2023, as it will be obscured by the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reason for 3I’s rapid brightening, which far exceeds the brightening rate of most Oort cloud comets at similar [radial distance], remains unclear,” said Karl Battams, an astrophysicist at the Naval Research Laboratory, and Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at Lowell Observatory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Without an established physical explanation, the outlook for 3I’s postperihelion behavior remains uncertain,” Battams and Zhang added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following previous discoveries that have raised interest in the characteristics of such bodies. The rapid brightening of 3I/ATLAS differs from typical Oort cloud comets and may indicate unique properties related to its composition and speed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible again in December 2023. Future observations may help clarify the reasons for its rapid brightening and provide further understanding of its characteristics.</p>
