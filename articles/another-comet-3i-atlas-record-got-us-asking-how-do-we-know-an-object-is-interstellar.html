      <h2>Another Comet 3I/ATLAS Record Got Us Asking: How Do We Know An Object Is Interstellar?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, identified as an interstellar object, is currently being studied by astronomers globally after its discovery this year, adding to the list of known interstellar visitors to the Solar System. This comet joins the ranks of 1I/’Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, which were discovered in 2017 and 2019, respectively.</p>

<p>The study of Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant because it provides insights into the nature and characteristics of interstellar objects. Astronomers are working to confirm its trajectory and understand its speed and orbital parameters, which differ from typical Solar System comets. This research could enhance our understanding of the composition and dynamics of the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object.</li>
  <li>It has an eccentricity between 6.1 and 6.2, indicating a hyperbolic orbit.</li>
  <li>The comet travels at a speed of 58 kilometers per second (130,000 miles per hour).</li>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2023.</li>
  <li>Its speed is notable as it was measured when the comet was over 300 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, the first interstellar object, 1I/’Oumuamua, was discovered. This was followed by the discovery of Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. In 2023, astronomers identified Comet 3I/ATLAS, which has since been the focus of extensive study.</p>
<p>Researchers have confirmed that Comet 3I/ATLAS has an eccentricity greater than one, which is characteristic of interstellar objects. This means it is not bound to the Sun and will not return after passing through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If you spot a moving object in the sky, you want to follow up on it. This allows you to confirm that the object is indeed real and not an artifact of the observing device,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects is rare. Prior to Comet 3I/ATLAS, only two such objects had been identified. The study of these comets provides valuable information about the conditions and materials present in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS and analyze its trajectory and composition. Ongoing research will help clarify the characteristics of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>
