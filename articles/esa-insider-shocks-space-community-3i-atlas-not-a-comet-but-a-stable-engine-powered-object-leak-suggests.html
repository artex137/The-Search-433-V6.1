      <h2>ESA Insider Shocks Space Community: 3I/ATLAS 'Not a Comet' but a Stable, Engine-Powered Object, Leak Suggests</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) is facing scrutiny after a purported insider has claimed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is not a comet, but a stable, engine-powered object. The allegations emerged on Tuesday, October 21, 2025, as the object continues its journey through the solar system.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and the transparency of space agencies. Authorities are reportedly investigating the claims and assessing the implications for ongoing research and public safety.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Claim made by an anonymous individual identifying as a Space Debris Engineer at ESA.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is described as emitting a constant, engine-like sound.</li>
    <li>Allegations of a cover-up involving ESA and NASA.</li>
    <li>Claims of new confidentiality agreements signed by ESA employees in August.</li>
    <li>Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected an unusual signature from 3I/ATLAS in mid-September.</li>
    <li>Source has not disclosed personal identity due to fears of professional repercussions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In mid-September 2025, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected a stable signature from 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it emits a constant sound. Following this, the alleged insider claims that data was transferred to NASA under a new secrecy protocol, cutting ESA scientists off from the information.</p>

<p>In August, the same insider reports that ESA employees were required to sign high-secrecy confidentiality agreements. This has raised concerns about transparency and collaboration between ESA and NASA.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You will see it all. In December, many home-based observers will see it all,”</blockquote> stated the anonymous insider, emphasizing their belief that significant events surrounding 3I/ATLAS are imminent.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims come amid growing frustrations regarding the lack of high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. These frustrations fuel speculation about a potential coordinated effort to conceal information about the object.</p>

<p>This incident highlights ongoing tensions in international space collaboration, particularly regarding data sharing and transparency between ESA and NASA.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to investigate the claims made by the ESA insider. The situation has prompted discussions about the need for increased transparency in space research and cooperation between agencies.</p>
