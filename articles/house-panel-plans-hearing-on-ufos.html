      <h2>House panel plans hearing on UFOs</h2>

<p>A House task force on government transparency will hold a hearing on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) on Tuesday, at 10 a.m. EDT. The hearing aims to address concerns regarding government disclosure of sightings and assessments of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), which some claim may pose a threat to public safety.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it follows ongoing calls for transparency from federal authorities regarding UAPs. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform’s Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, stated that whistleblowers should feel safe to disclose information related to UAPs without fear of retribution.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing scheduled for Tuesday at 10 a.m. EDT.</li>
    <li>Location: not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Witnesses include Air Force veterans Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Dylan Borland, Navy veteran Alexandro Wiggins, and journalist George Knapp.</li>
    <li>Focus: Pentagon disclosures about UFOs and the Department of Defense’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.</li>
    <li>Previous hearing by a House Oversight subcommittee occurred in the fall of 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>The House Oversight and Government Reform’s Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets has scheduled this hearing following a series of discussions on UAPs. In the fall of 2024, a separate House Oversight subcommittee held a hearing where witnesses expressed that the government had not been transparent regarding UFO cases spanning several decades.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>

<blockquote>“The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans’ safety,” said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Whistleblowers who provide details on spending information and policies and procedures regarding the classification and declassification of UAPs should be able to do so without retribution,” she added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>This upcoming hearing is part of a broader effort by lawmakers to ensure that the public is informed about the government's handling of UAP sightings. Previous testimonies have indicated a lack of forthcoming information from government agencies, raising concerns about accountability and transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>

<p>The hearing will provide an opportunity for witnesses to share their experiences and insights on UAPs, and it may influence future policies regarding the classification and disclosure of related information by the Department of Defense.</p>
