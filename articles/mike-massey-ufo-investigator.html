      <h2>Mike Massey: UFO Investigator</h2>

<p>Mike Massey, a UFO field investigator with the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), has shared his journey into the world of UFO investigations during a recent interview. Massey has been active in the field for about a year and is based in Whatcom County, Washington. He is dedicated to investigating reports of unidentified flying objects using a variety of methods and tools.</p>

<p>This investigation work is significant as it challenges long-held beliefs about UFOs and aims to provide credible explanations for sightings. Massey, who joined MUFON after attending a seminar, emphasizes the importance of thorough investigations to maintain public trust in the organization's findings.</p>

<p>During his investigations, Massey utilizes various tools to assess sightings, including weather data and air traffic information. He aims to analyze reports thoroughly to ensure accurate conclusions are drawn.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I try to be pretty thorough and open. Before I say something’s unknown, I want to make sure I checked all the different possibilities,” Massey said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It’s important to not suffer the falsehoods the government has told us for years... I think we should just be honest about what it is and then find out what it is,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Massey plans to continue his investigations with MUFON, focusing on unexplained sightings and maintaining trust in the organization’s methodologies. Further analysis of notable sightings, such as the black triangle in Fairhaven, will be pursued to seek credible explanations.
