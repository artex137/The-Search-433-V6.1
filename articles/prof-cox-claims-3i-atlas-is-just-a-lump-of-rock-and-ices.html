      <h2>Prof. Cox Claims 3I/ATLAS Is Just a 'Lump of Rock and Ices'</h2>

<p>Professor Brian Cox, a physicist from the University of Manchester, has stated that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is simply a "pristine lump of rock and ices." The comet was first detected on 1 July 2025 by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile. Its unusual trajectory sparked widespread speculation, but Cox asserts that the mystery surrounding it is now resolved.</p>

<p>This clarification from Cox is significant as it counters various theories suggesting that 3I/ATLAS could be of alien origin. Authorities, including NASA, have confirmed that the object poses no threat to Earth and will pass approximately 240 million kilometres away.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected on 1 July 2025 in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Confirmed by NASA's ATLAS system.</li>
    <li>Object will pass Earth at a distance of about 240 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Estimated age of 3I/ATLAS is around 7 billion years.</li>
    <li>Speed and trajectory have ruled out any potential mission by the European Space Agency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on 1 July 2025 when it was detected by NASA's ATLAS in Chile. The object quickly gained attention due to its unusual speed and trajectory, leading to various theories about its origins. Cox's comments regarding its composition and nature follow a series of discussions about its potential implications for humanity and the scientific community.</p>

<p>Despite speculation, NASA confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. As the object approaches the Sun, it has been observed to emit vapour jets, typical of comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Just to be clear – given recent drivel online – Comet 3I/ATLAS is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff,” said Cox in a post on X (formerly Twitter).</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It is entirely natural in origin, its orbit is as expected and it will whizz around the Sun and then disappear off into the galaxy again,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time an interstellar object has captured public attention. 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. The speculation surrounding 3I/ATLAS has been fueled by its unusual characteristics, leading to comparisons with previous discoveries.</p>

<p>Concerns over potential alien technology were raised by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be a technological artefact. However, Cox has dismissed these claims, reinforcing the scientific understanding of the object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, scientists will monitor its path and behaviour. The scientific community will likely conduct further analyses to better understand this ancient comet and its implications for the study of interstellar objects.</p>
