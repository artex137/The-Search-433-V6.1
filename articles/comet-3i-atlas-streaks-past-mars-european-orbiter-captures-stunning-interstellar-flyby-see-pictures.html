      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS streaks past Mars: European orbiter captures stunning interstellar flyby</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has made a close approach to Mars on 3 October 2023, with no reported injuries or fatalities. This rare celestial event has drawn significant attention from scientists and the public alike.</p>

<p>The comet, confirmed to have originated outside of Earth’s solar system, is one of only three interstellar objects ever discovered. The European Space Agency (ESA) has stated that its Mars orbiters have captured images of 3I/ATLAS during this flyby, providing a unique opportunity for further study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars on 3 October 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 30 million km away from Mars at its closest point.</li>
    <li>It was first observed by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at about 137,000 miles per hour (220,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be around 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass within 130 million miles of the Sun on 30 October 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023 by the Hubble Space Telescope, which estimated its icy nucleus size to be between 1,000 feet and 3.5 miles wide. After months of public interest and speculation, the comet made its closest approach to Mars on 3 October 2023, where it was observed by ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express orbiter.</p>
<p>As it continues its journey, 3I/ATLAS is expected to get closer to the Sun on 30 October 2023, providing additional observation opportunities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The images captured during the closest approach to Mars provide a unique opportunity to study this interstellar object,” said a spokesperson for the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in October 2017 and 2I/Borisov in August 2019. The rarity of such visitors has sparked interest and various theories regarding their origins and compositions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ESA plans to continue analyzing images from its Mars satellites to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS’s size and composition as it approaches the Sun.</p>
