      <h2>Google Maps users puzzled by 'UFO' discovery in Antarctica</h2>

<p>Google Maps users have spotted a round object described as a 'UFO' hidden under a cliff approximately 145 kilometres from Antarctica's coast. The discovery has sparked a flurry of speculation regarding its origin and purpose.</p>

<p>This sighting has drawn attention from ufologists and social media users alike. Authorities have not yet commented on the object, which appears to be situated close to the A. B. Dobrowolski Polar Station, a Polish research base.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2025, Google Maps users began discussing a round object resembling a UFO after its coordinates were shared online. The object appears to have a black colour and a sliverish line around its rim, matching common depictions of UFOs.</p>
<p>Four years prior, a Reddit user posted a screenshot of the object, prompting various theories about its nature. Some speculated it could be a weather balloon or a geological formation.</p>
<p>Scott C. Waring, who runs the UFO Sightings Daily website, highlighted the object in a YouTube video, suggesting it may be stuck under the cliff or hidden for a reason.</p>
