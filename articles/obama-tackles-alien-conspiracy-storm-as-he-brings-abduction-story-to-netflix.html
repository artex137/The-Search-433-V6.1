      <h2>Obama tackles alien conspiracy storm as he brings abduction story to Netflix</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has clarified his recent comments about extraterrestrial life, stating he has never seen evidence of aliens during his presidency. Obama made the remarks on Instagram on February 15, 2026, following an interview with Brian Tyler Cohen in which he discussed the possibility of life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>Obama's statements have sparked renewed interest in UFOs and alien abduction stories, particularly as his production company, Higher Ground Productions, plans to develop a film based on the famous Betty and Barney Hill abduction case from 1961. The film, titled <em>White Mountains</em>, aims to recount the couple's claims of being abducted by aliens while driving through New Hampshire.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Obama posted on Instagram on February 15, 2026.</li>
    <li>His comments came during an interview with Brian Tyler Cohen.</li>
    <li>Higher Ground Productions is developing a film titled <em>White Mountains</em>.</li>
    <li>The Hill abduction incident occurred on September 19, 1961.</li>
    <li>Betty and Barney Hill claimed to have been abducted while driving through New Hampshire.</li>
    <li>No release date for the film has been announced.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 19, 1961, Betty and Barney Hill were driving home from a vacation in Canada when they reported seeing a strange light in the sky. The couple initially thought it was a plane but later described it as a cigar-shaped craft with non-human figures inside. After experiencing a two-hour memory gap, the Hills underwent hypnosis, revealing memories of being taken aboard the UFO.</p>

<p>In February 2026, Obama clarified his comments about extraterrestrial life, emphasizing that he has not seen evidence of aliens during his presidency. He noted that the vast distances between solar systems make it unlikely that intelligent beings have visited Earth. The film project based on the Hills' story was first reported in 2022.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” Obama stated in his Instagram post. “I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Betty and Barney Hill abduction case is one of the first and most well-known UFO abduction stories in the United States. The couple's claims have been met with skepticism, yet they maintained their story throughout their lives, passing lie detector tests. Barney Hill passed away in 1969, and Betty Hill died in 2004.</p>

<p>Despite Obama's assertions that no evidence of extraterrestrials exists at Area 51, the Air Force has historically kept operations at the site under wraps. The CIA admitted to the base's existence in 2013, revealing its use for Cold War aircraft testing, but conspiracy theories about alien activity persist.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The film <em>White Mountains</em> is still in early development, and no further details about its production timeline or release date have been disclosed. Obama has not publicly commented further on the project or the Hill abduction claims.</p>
