      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Will Be At Its Closest To The Sun This Week</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, passing within 203 million kilometers (126 million miles) of the star. This distance is approximately 36 percent further than the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>The approach of Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks the peak of the comet's activity before it speeds away from the Solar System. The European Space Agency (ESA) has monitored the comet’s trajectory and activity, while the JUICE mission, en route to Jupiter, will observe the comet this week.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: October 29</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: 203 million kilometers (126 million miles)</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars during recent passage: 30 million kilometers (18 million miles)</li>
    <li>Water loss rate: buckets of water per second</li>
    <li>Dust loss: over 180 kilograms (397 pounds)</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Earth: December 19, at about 269 million kilometers (167 million miles)</li>
    <li>Upcoming observations by JWST: December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed since July, displaying high activity levels and a peculiar anti-tail. It passed closest to Mars in early October, which was recorded by ESA orbiters. As of late October, the comet will reach its perihelion, marking its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>Following the perihelion, the comet will begin to move away from the Sun and cool down, continuing its journey out of the Solar System. The peak of its activity is expected this week, coinciding with JUICE's observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Sun is the closest star 3I/ATLAS has visited in at least 10 million years,” said an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We have had a lot fewer observations over the last month because the comet is currently on the other side of the Sun with respect to Earth,” the representative added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the Solar System. Its activity has been noteworthy, with significant water and dust loss observed. This behavior is not uncommon for comets but is particularly pronounced in this case, contributing to the excitement surrounding its passage.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach to the Sun, Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue to be monitored by various space agencies, with upcoming observations planned for December 2025 by the JWST and other observatories.</p>
