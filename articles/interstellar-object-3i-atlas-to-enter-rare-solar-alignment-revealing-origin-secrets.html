      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS to Enter Rare Solar Alignment, Revealing Origin Secrets</h2>

<p>Earth, the sun, and the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS will align almost perfectly on January 22, 2026. This unique alignment will allow scientists to study the object in unprecedented detail, potentially revealing secrets about its origins. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this cosmic event.</p>

<p>This alignment is significant because it offers a rare opportunity to observe 3I/ATLAS under conditions that enhance its visibility. NASA and other agencies are preparing for this event, which could yield valuable insights into the characteristics of this interstellar visitor. 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Alignment date: January 22, 2026</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during alignment: 1.8 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Speed of 3I/ATLAS: nearly 58 kilometres per second relative to the sun</li>
    <li>Diameter of the object's nucleus: between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres</li>
    <li>Orbital eccentricity: 6.1, the highest recorded for an interstellar object</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovery agency: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile. Since its discovery, scientists have been monitoring its trajectory and characteristics. The object is set to reach a critical alignment with Earth and the sun on January 22, 2026. Following this event, it will pass through the gravitational domain of Jupiter by March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS serves as a literal interstellar time capsule, offering insights into the conditions of its home system,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The upcoming alignment will allow us to analyze the physical properties of the dust surrounding 3I/ATLAS more effectively than ever before,” stated an astronomer involved in the project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system. Previous visitors, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have presented challenges in understanding their origins. The unique properties of 3I/ATLAS, including its high carbon dioxide to water ratio, suggest it may come from an older planetary system.</p>

<p>The study of interstellar objects is becoming increasingly relevant as they provide clues about the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the solar alignment on January 22, 2026, scientists will analyze the data collected during this period. Research will focus on the physical properties of 3I/ATLAS and its surrounding dust, with findings expected to contribute to our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>
