      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-06 13:54 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS Anomalies and Kinetic Energy Update: Interstellar Object Raises Concerns</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object, has been identified with unusual characteristics by Harvard astrophysicist Prof. Avi Loeb since its detection on July 1, 2025. The object, which entered the Solar System from another star system, exhibits anomalies that suggest it may not be a typical natural body, raising questions about its origin and potential impact.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its immense kinetic energy and the insights it may provide into interstellar objects. Authorities are monitoring its trajectory and studying its properties to enhance planetary defense systems and improve global detection capabilities for potentially hazardous objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date detected:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> Exceeds 5 km, potentially up to 20 km</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 100,000 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Kinetic energy potential:</strong> Equivalent to 10 million megatons of TNT</li>
    <li><strong>Orbital inclination:</strong> 5 degrees relative to the Solar System's ecliptic</li>
    <li><strong>Loeb Scale rating:</strong> 2, indicating possible technological origin</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, at a distance of 4.5 astronomical units from the Sun. Since its discovery, scientists have noted its unique features, which differ from previous interstellar objects like 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Observations have focused on its size, jet behavior, and chemical composition.</p>
<p>The object has been found to show a forward-pointing jet and an unusual light polarisation pattern, challenging existing models of comet behavior. Its orbital path, which allows close approaches to inner planets, has raised questions about its alignment and potential origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While natural explanations may exist for individual anomalies, explaining all seven together is unlikely,” said Prof. Avi Loeb regarding the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. Its study provides valuable insights into objects from other star systems. The object’s size and kinetic energy highlight the potential risks posed by interstellar debris, emphasizing the need for improved planetary defense systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further data from Mars orbiters is expected in October 2025, which may clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Scientists will continue to monitor the object and assess its trajectory, while also advocating for enhanced detection and defense measures against future interstellar threats.</p>
