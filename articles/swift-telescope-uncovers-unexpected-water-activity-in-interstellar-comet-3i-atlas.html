      <h2>Swift telescope uncovers unexpected water activity in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Scientists at Auburn University have announced the detection of hydroxyl gas around the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. This discovery, revealed in research published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, marks the first time water-related activity has been measured in an interstellar comet through ultraviolet observations. The measurements occurred in July and August 2025 when the comet was located far from the Sun, at a distance where water ice is typically inactive.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it allows researchers to compare interstellar comets with those formed in our solar system. The Swift Observatory's ability to detect ultraviolet emissions, which are absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere, has provided new insights into the composition and activity of 3I/ATLAS. The estimated water loss rate from the comet is about 40 kilograms per second, indicating ongoing water activity at an unexpected distance from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2025.</li>
    <li>Hydroxyl gas detected indicates water-related activity.</li>
    <li>Swift Observatory observed the comet in July and August 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth.</li>
    <li>Estimated water loss rate is about 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>Findings published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2025, becoming the third confirmed interstellar comet. Researchers used the Swift Observatory to observe the comet in July and August 2025, detecting hydroxyl gas as a byproduct of water vapor. The observations revealed significant water activity at a distance where typical comets show little to no activity.</p>

<p>The Swift Observatory was able to capture emissions that would have been invisible from Earth, providing critical data for comparison with solar system comets. The comet has since faded from view but is expected to be observable again after mid-November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we detect water, or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH, from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, professor of physics at Auburn University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“’Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn’t expect it,” stated Zexi Xing, postdoctoral researcher at Auburn University and lead author of the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet observed, following "Oumuamua," which showed no volatile gases, and 2I/Borisov, which was rich in carbon monoxide. The detection of water-related activity in 3I/ATLAS suggests varying conditions for comet formation across different planetary systems. Similar water release behavior has been observed in some solar system comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. This ongoing observation may provide further insights into the comet's activity and enhance comparisons with other interstellar objects. The comet is expected to be visible again after mid-November 2025.</p>
