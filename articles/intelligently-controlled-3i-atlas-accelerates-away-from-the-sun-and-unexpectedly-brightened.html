      <h2>'Intelligently Controlled': 3I/ATLAS Accelerates Away From The Sun And Unexpectedly Brightened</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has accelerated away from the Sun and unexpectedly brightened, surprising astronomers as it reached its closest point to the Sun on 29 October 2023. The unusual characteristics of this interstellar visitor have captivated researchers, who are investigating its nature and origin.</p>

<p>This phenomenon matters because it offers a rare opportunity to study the chemical composition of material from beyond our solar system. Authorities and researchers are closely monitoring the comet, which is now hidden by solar glare until mid-to-late November 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on 29 October 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system.</li>
    <li>Predecessors include 'Oumuamua' (October 2017) and 2I/Borisov (August 2019).</li>
    <li>Monitoring is conducted by Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and GOES-19.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be obscured by solar glare until November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 29 October 2023, Comet 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion. Researchers observed a dramatic increase in brightness, which was unexpected and has not been fully explained.</p>
<p>Prior to this event, scientists anticipated a surge in brightness due to solar radiation causing sublimation, a common process for comets. However, 3I/ATLAS brightened at a rate far exceeding expectations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reason for 3I's rapid brightening, which far exceeds the brightening rate of most Oort cloud comets at similar radial distance, remains unclear,” said Qicheng Zhang from the Lowell Observatory and Karl Battams, an astrophysicist at the NRL.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar visitor confirmed to have entered our solar system. Its predecessors, 'Oumuamua' and 2I/Borisov, have provided insights into the composition of material from other star systems. The unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has sparked intense speculation regarding its origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely to establish a more definitive cause for its unusual brightening and behaviour as it moves out of the Sun's glare in late 2025.</p>
