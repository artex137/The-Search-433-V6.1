      <h2>Thousands of potential UFOs spotted in 1950s photos — before satellites even dotted the sky: studies</h2>

<p>Astronomer Beatriz Villarroel from the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics has reported the detection of potential UFOs in photographs taken between 1949 and 1958. The findings, published in two peer-reviewed papers, suggest the presence of "transients," which are fleeting star-like objects of unknown origin, in historic photographic plates from the Palomar Observatory in California. The research indicates a correlation between these transients and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) sightings.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it challenges previous assumptions about the origins of UAP sightings. Villarroel's analysis of historical data may provide insights into unexplained aerial events that have puzzled researchers for decades. The studies suggest that these transients could be linked to UFO sightings and nuclear tests, prompting further investigation by the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Researchers analyzed approximately 2,000 photographic plates taken at the Palomar Observatory.</li>
    <li>The study covered the period from 1949 to 1958.</li>
    <li>107,000 transient lights were identified, many of which remain unexplained.</li>
    <li>Transients were noted to be 45% more likely to appear within 24 hours of a nuclear test.</li>
    <li>Multiple transients were observed on July 19 and 27, 1952, coinciding with the Washington DC UFO Incident.</li>
    <li>The last observed transient related to nuclear testing was on March 17, 1956.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The research timeline is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1949-1958: Photographs taken at the Palomar Observatory as part of the Palomar Sky Survey.</li>
    <li>October 17, 2025: Publication of findings in Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.</li>
    <li>October 20, 2025: Publication of additional findings in Nature’s Scientific Reports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We speculate that some transients could potentially be [unidentified aerial phenomena] in Earth orbit that, if descending into the atmosphere, might provide the stimulus for some [unidentified aerial phenomenon] sightings,” said Villarroel in her research paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Overall, findings of this study support our speculative hypotheses that transients exhibit some degree of association with both nuclear testing and reports of UAP,” the paper concluded.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The findings build on a history of UAP sightings that have intrigued researchers and the public alike. Previous studies have suggested links between UAP sightings and military activities, particularly around nuclear testing. Villarroel's research adds a historical perspective, examining data from a time before the presence of man-made satellites.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations are expected as the scientific community reviews Villarroel's findings. Researchers aim to explore the implications of these transients on our understanding of UAP and their potential connection to historical events, including nuclear tests.</p>
