      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Travels at 61 km/s, Surpassing Voyager 1 in Speed</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has traveled through the Solar System at a speed of 61 kilometres per second, surpassing Voyager 1, according to NASA and ESA astronomers. Discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, the comet has been monitored since it appeared 420 million miles from the Sun.</p>

<p>This event highlights the significance of 3I/ATLAS as the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our region. Authorities from NASA and ESA have actively monitored its trajectory, noting its hyperbolic orbit and high speed, which contrasts with the slower speeds of human-made spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 61 km/s (221,000 km/h)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 277 million miles as of November 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Diameter:</strong> Estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 km</li>
    <li><strong>Dust Ejection:</strong> 6 kg of fine dust per second in July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Estimated between 3 to 11 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025, as it approached the orbit of Jupiter. Initial observations showed a reddish coma of dust. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, just beyond Mars, with increasing speed driven by solar gravity.</p>

<p>On November 30, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet's tails while it was 277 million miles from Earth. This observation confirmed ongoing activity and highlighted the comet's significant speed compared to Voyager probes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The speed of 3I/ATLAS highlights the differences between natural celestial bodies and man-made objects in deep space,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Its trajectory and activity provide valuable insights into the dynamics of interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its hyperbolic trajectory, which confirms its external origin. Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have traveled at slower speeds of 26 km/s and 32 km/s, respectively. The current comet’s unique composition and high speed emphasize the limitations of current human technology in space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025. Further observations and data collection are expected to enhance understanding of its composition and trajectory.</p>
