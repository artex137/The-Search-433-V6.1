      <h2>Anything to distract from Epstein files? Trump admin reportedly agrees to disclose alleged alien secrets at US bases</h2>

<p>The Trump administration has reportedly agreed to disclose information related to alleged extraterrestrial activities at US military bases, including Area 51, amid ongoing public scrutiny over the Epstein Files. Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri has been granted access to investigate these facilities, which are rumored to contain alien spacecraft and bodies of extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it coincides with heightened public interest in the Epstein Files, which have implicated several high-profile individuals, including Donald Trump. The congressional oversight committee is currently investigating claims related to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), and Burlison has indicated that the administration is prepared to release extensive information on the matter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Trump administration has allowed the release of information on UFO facilities in the US.</li>
    <li>Congressman Eric Burlison has gained access to secure locations linked to UFOs.</li>
    <li>Claims include the existence of alien spacecraft and bodies at various military sites.</li>
    <li>Other facilities of interest include Naval Air Station Patuxent River, the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center, and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.</li>
    <li>The congressional oversight committee is investigating claims about government knowledge of alien visits.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, the White House has signaled readiness to release information regarding UFOs and related phenomena. Congressman Eric Burlison, a member of the oversight committee, has been vocal about his belief in government cover-ups regarding extraterrestrial encounters.</p>
<p>Burlison has stated that the Department of Defense has been instructed to facilitate his requests for information on these secret facilities. He has previously claimed that the military has recovered UFOs since the 1940s and that there are alien-human hybrids living on Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The White House has told the DoD to make it happen. The extent at which they've been involved is literally just saying to the Department of Defense that 'we're backing his request. Do what you can to make it happen.'” - Congressman Eric Burlison</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Nevada Test and Training Range, which includes Area 51, is known for its classified military operations and has been a focal point for UFO sightings. The timing of the disclosure coincides with public outrage over the Epstein Files, which have revealed disturbing allegations against several prominent figures.</p>
<p>This juxtaposition has led to speculation about the administration's motivations for releasing information on UFOs at this time.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the congressional oversight committee continues its investigation, further disclosures regarding the nature of the information held at these facilities are expected. The timeline for the release of this information remains unclear.</p>
