      <h2>Inside the Massive Radio Search of Our Newest Interstellar Guest</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has conducted a detailed search for artificial signals from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) in July 2025. The ATA has scanned the comet for 7.25 hours across five sessions following its discovery, with no evidence of synthetic radio signals detected.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it aims to clarify misconceptions regarding 3I/ATLAS and its potential as an alien technology. The ATA’s findings, published in a pre-print paper by Sofia Sheikh and co-authors from the SETI Institute, reveal the methodology used to rule out artificial signals and confirm the comet's natural characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Tool:</strong> Allen Telescope Array (ATA)</li>
    <li><strong>Total Observation Time:</strong> 7.25 hours</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Period:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Signals Detected:</strong> Over 70 million potential signals</li>
    <li><strong>Candidate Signals After Filtering:</strong> 211</li>
    <li><strong>Final Result:</strong> No synthetic radio-frequency techno-signature detected</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in the summer of 2025. In July, the ATA began its observational campaign, utilizing its newly upgraded "Antonio" feeds for improved sensitivity. Over the course of five sessions, the telescope monitored a frequency range of 1-12 GHz. After extensive filtering using the Breakthrough Listen Interesting Signal Search (bliss) algorithm, researchers narrowed down the potential signals to 211, which were all determined to be caused by Earth-based interference.</p>

<p>Other observatories, including the Green Bank Telescope, MeerKAT, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, have also confirmed the natural characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, reinforcing the findings of the ATA.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>

<blockquote>“After all that filtering, we ended with a ‘null’ result—no synthetic radio-frequency techno-signature appeared to be emanating from 3I/ATLAS,” said Sofia Sheikh from the SETI Institute.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The sensitivity improvements allowed us to rule out any transmitter that was even 10% of the power of a modern cell phone,” stated a representative from the Green Bank Telescope team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, sparking interest among astronomers regarding its origins and composition. Previous observations have consistently indicated its natural characteristics, including a coma and water outgassing. The debate surrounding the potential for alien technology has been fueled by the growing interest in exoplanets and the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, astronomers will maintain their monitoring efforts. Further research will likely focus on confirming its natural properties and examining its trajectory, while addressing ongoing speculation about its origins.</p>
