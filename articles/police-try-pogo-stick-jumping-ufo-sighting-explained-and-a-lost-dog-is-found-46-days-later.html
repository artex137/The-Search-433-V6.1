      <h2>Police Try Pogo Stick Jumping, UFO Sighting Explained, and a Lost Dog Found 46 Days Later</h2>

<p>Police in Tewksbury have recently engaged with James Roumeliotis, a pogo stick jumping record holder, while a UFO sighting on November 4 has been explained as a rocket launch. Meanwhile, a lost dog named Lady has been found after 46 days missing.</p>
