      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS's Acceleration Might Not Be Caused By Gravity</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest since its discovery by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. The comet, the third interstellar visitor to the solar system, has been observed accelerating rapidly near the sun, sparking speculation about its nature and origins.</p>

<p>This acceleration has led scientists to propose that it is not driven by gravity but rather by the comet losing mass. The implications of this finding could enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their behaviors as they travel through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun occurred on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Will come within approximately 170 million miles of Earth.</li>
    <li>Estimated size ranges from 440 meters to 1,600 meters in diameter.</li>
    <li>CO<sub>2</sub>-to-H<sub>2</sub>O ratio is 8:1, one of the highest recorded.</li>
    <li>Expected to reappear on the other side of the sun in early December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first reported the existence of comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, observations indicated unusual acceleration patterns, prompting investigations into its nature. The comet made its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2025, and is anticipated to emerge from behind the sun in early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The leading theory is that its acceleration is not caused by alien antimatter drives, but instead by it losing mass,” said a representative from the scientific community.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The behavior of this comet has certainly drawn the attention of the scientific community. It presents a great opportunity for discovery,” noted an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object to pass through our solar system, highlighting the limited understanding scientists have of such phenomena. Previous interstellar visitors have prompted similar investigations, but the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its high carbon dioxide levels and rapid brightness increase, provide new avenues for research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers plan to conduct further observations once it reappears in December 2025. These observations may yield insights into its mass loss and the unusual color changes that have been recorded.</p>
