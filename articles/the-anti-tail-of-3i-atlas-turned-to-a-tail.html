      <h2>The Anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS Turned to a Tail</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, taken by the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands, Spain, show that the anti-tail observed during July and August 2025 has transitioned into a tail as of September 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This transition is significant as it indicates changes in the object’s activity due to solar radiation. Researchers are analyzing data from various telescopes to understand the implications of this transformation and the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including astronomers from multiple institutions, are closely monitoring the object as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS observed by the Nordic Optical Telescope in September 2025.</li>
    <li>Mass loss rate estimated at 150 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>Composition: 87% CO2, 9% CO, 4% H2O.</li>
    <li>Mass loss from July to October 2025 totals about 2 million tons.</li>
    <li>Diameter of 3I/ATLAS is about 5 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, high-resolution imaging of 3I/ATLAS revealed a pronounced anti-tail. The transition to a tail occurred in September 2025 as the object approached the Sun. Observations from the Keck telescope and Gemini South observatory supported these findings. These changes are attributed to the sublimation of CO2, which produces ice fragments ejected from the nucleus.</p>
<p>As of October 2025, further observations are anticipated from the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, expected to provide additional insights into the object's behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The transition from an anti-tail to a tail indicates an increase in activity as 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun," said David Jewitt, one of the authors of the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is consistent with previous observations of interstellar objects, such as 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Understanding the activity of 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the characteristics of other interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it nears the Sun, with post-perihelion observations planned for December 2025 to gather further data on its characteristics and behavior.</p>
