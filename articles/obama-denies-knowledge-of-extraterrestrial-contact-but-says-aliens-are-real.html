      <h2>Obama Denies Knowledge of Extraterrestrial Contact But Says Aliens Are ‘Real’</h2>

<p>Former President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> has stated that aliens are real during a conversation with influencer <strong>Brian Tyler Cohen</strong> on Saturday, though he denied any knowledge of extraterrestrial contact or the existence of secret facilities like Area 51. The discussion, which has garnered over 4 million views on YouTube, touches on the broader topic of political divisions in the U.S.</p>

<p>This revelation has sparked interest among both supporters and skeptics about the existence of extraterrestrial life. Obama clarified his remarks on Instagram, emphasizing that while the universe is vast and likely harbors life, he saw no evidence of alien visitors during his presidency.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interview took place on Saturday, exact time not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Obama confirmed aliens are "real," but has not seen them.</li>
    <li>Over 4 million views on the YouTube video since posting.</li>
    <li>Obama's Instagram clarification was posted on Sunday evening.</li>
    <li>Current estimates suggest there are approximately one sextillion habitable planets in the universe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Saturday, Obama participated in a discussion with Cohen where he directly answered a question about the existence of aliens. He stated, “They’re real,” while downplaying the likelihood of contact. The YouTube video of this conversation was uploaded shortly after. The following day, Obama shared a clip on his Instagram account and provided further clarification regarding his views on extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” Obama said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Recent advancements in astronomy have led to a growing scientific consensus about the potential for extraterrestrial life. According to journalist <strong>Garret M. Graff</strong>, estimates indicate there are around one sextillion planets capable of supporting life. However, the vast distances between these planets suggest that any form of contact remains improbable.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in extraterrestrial life continues to grow, discussions around the topic are expected to evolve, particularly in light of new scientific discoveries and public interest in government transparency regarding UFOs.</p>
