      <h2>Vera Rubin telescope camera captured 3I/ATLAS weeks before its public unveiling</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was first recorded by the Observatório Vera C. Rubin in Chile on June 21, 2025, just ten days before its official discovery. The capture occurred during calibration tests of the telescope's equipment, which was not yet operational. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it underscores the advanced technical capabilities of the Vera Rubin telescope, which successfully detected the comet’s trail during routine testing. The findings highlight the importance of high-precision instruments in identifying rare astronomical phenomena, particularly those that occur unexpectedly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of capture: June 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Observatório Vera C. Rubin, Chile</li>
    <li>Telescope diameter: 8.4 meters</li>
    <li>Detection system: Automated ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System)</li>
    <li>Significance: Detection of organic material from the comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 21, 2025, the Vera Rubin telescope was engaged in routine calibration tests. During these tests, astronomers conducted a retrospective analysis of archive images. This analysis revealed the unmistakable trail of comet 3I/ATLAS, which was already beginning to eject organic material.</p>

<p>Just two days later, the telescope officially opened for operations, although the comet's existence had already been captured in its data. The formal discovery of 3I/ATLAS was later attributed to the ATLAS system, which continuously scans the night sky for moving celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This initial record underlines the importance of high-precision instruments in detecting fleeting and unexpected astronomical phenomena,” said a representative from the Observatório Vera C. Rubin.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS are rare and difficult to track due to their high speeds and hyperbolic trajectories. The presence of organic compounds in these objects suggests that life’s building blocks may be more widespread in the universe than previously thought.</p>

<p>The study of such comets enhances our understanding of the primordial material found in distant nebulae and supports theories like panspermia, which proposes that life or its precursors can be transferred between planets via celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will conduct in-depth studies of the composition of 3I/ATLAS to gather crucial data for astrobiology. The Vera Rubin telescope aims to enhance the detection and tracking of transient celestial objects, potentially leading to more discoveries of interstellar comets in the future.</p>
