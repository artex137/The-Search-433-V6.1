      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Surrounded by Mysterious Jet Structure</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed surrounded by a complex jet structure, raising questions about its nature. New images captured on November 8 reveal at least seven distinct jets, according to Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb, who published his findings on Medium. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may indicate whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural object or an artificial craft. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring the comet closely as it approaches Earth, with its closest point expected on December 19. Dr. Loeb emphasizes the need for further measurements to determine the characteristics of the jets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July.</li>
    <li>Images showing the jet structure were taken on November 8.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth is set for December 19.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30.</li>
    <li>The comet will reappear in the eastern sky on November 11, 2025.</li>
    <li>Viewing will require a telescope with at least an 8-inch (20 cm) aperture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2023. It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, coming within 130 million miles (1.36 astronomical units). On November 8, new images revealed a complex jet structure surrounding the comet. It is expected to reappear in the eastern pre-dawn sky on November 11, 2025.</p>

<blockquote>“It would be easy to test whether 3I/ATLAS is natural or technological by measuring the outflow velocity, mass flux and composition of its jets during the coming month,” Dr. Loeb wrote.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has shown unusual behaviors that have led to speculation about its origins. Dr. Loeb has noted its non-gravitational acceleration and its unusual glow, suggesting possible technological signatures. The discussion surrounding the comet's nature has intensified with the recent discovery of another interstellar object, C/2025 V1, although Dr. Loeb has expressed doubts about any connection between the two.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observations during its closest approach will help scientists determine the nature of the jets and whether the comet is a natural object or possibly an artificial craft.</p>
