      <h2>Top fighter pilot reveals UFO encounter at UK nuclear base</h2>

<p>A former Top Gun pilot has broken a 45-year silence to disclose a UFO encounter involving a 50ft triangular craft near a nuclear base in England on December 26, 1980. Dan Isbell, 69, shared his experience while stationed at RAF Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire, where he saw the craft surrounded by multicolored lights while on a Christmas shift.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it coincides with a separate incident involving US Air Force personnel at RAF Woodbridge, who reported seeing a similar craft descending into Rendlesham Forest on the same night. The Rendlesham incident has become known as the UK's most famous UFO case and has drawn the attention of UFO researchers and the Department of Defense's UFO-monitoring office.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: December 26, 1980</li>
    <li>Location: RAF Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire, England</li>
    <li>Witness: Dan Isbell, 24, first lieutenant at the time</li>
    <li>Craft description: 50ft triangular shape with multicolored lights</li>
    <li>Proximity: Isbell approached within 150ft of the craft</li>
    <li>Related incident: Similar sighting at RAF Woodbridge, 110 miles away</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 26, 1980, at approximately 10pm, Dan Isbell was driving his red Corvette along a country road when he noticed unusual multicolored lights in his rear-view mirror. He pulled over and observed a silent, floating triangular craft with changing lights.</p>

<p>Isbell approached the object on foot but reversed course after considering the potential impact on his military career. Meanwhile, earlier that night, US Air Force personnel at RAF Woodbridge reported a similar craft descending into nearby Rendlesham Forest.</p>

<p>After the incident, Isbell did not disclose his experience for 45 years until he spoke with the Daily Mail in November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We were very well trained before we were declared mission-qualified, on how to identify every type of aircraft and helicopter that belonged to NATO or the Soviet Union. It was quite clear this was not conventional.” - Dan Isbell</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Dan Isbell is as credible a witness you could ever wish for. His account offers a remarkable circumstantial link to Britain's most famous case, the Rendlesham Forest Incident.” - Gary Heseltine</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Rendlesham Forest incident has been widely studied and remains a focal point for UFO enthusiasts and researchers. The involvement of US Air Force personnel and the occurrence of multiple sightings on the same night raises questions about the nature of these encounters.</p>

<p>In recent years, the US Department of Defense has increased scrutiny of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), leading to a broader discussion about military encounters with such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the Rendlesham Forest incident and related UFO sightings are ongoing. Isbell's testimony may contribute to further inquiries, as UFO researchers continue to seek credible witnesses and evidence surrounding these phenomena.</p>
