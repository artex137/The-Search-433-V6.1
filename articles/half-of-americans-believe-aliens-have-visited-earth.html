      <h2>Half of Americans believe aliens have visited Earth</h2>

<p>A recent YouGov poll has revealed that nearly half of Americans, specifically 47%, believe aliens have definitely or probably visited Earth at some point. The survey results, released in September 2024, indicate a growing interest in extraterrestrial life among the U.S. population, with 56% of respondents asserting that aliens definitely or probably exist.</p>

<p>This polling data highlights the public's perception of potential alien encounters. Many Americans express concerns about the implications of such encounters, fearing that they could negatively affect human civilization. The poll results have prompted discussions among researchers and government officials about the need for further investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 2024, YouGov conducted a poll assessing American beliefs about aliens and UFOs. The results indicated a significant portion of the population believes in the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>The poll also revealed varying opinions on the potential impact of an alien encounter, with most respondents fearing negative consequences.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If aliens visited Earth, Americans are about twice as likely to think the effect would be negative as to say it would be positive,” according to the YouGov poll. “29% believe it would be positive, while 14% think it would be negative.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This poll reflects a trend of increasing belief in extraterrestrial life among Americans. Previous surveys have shown similar results, with growing numbers of people expressing interest in UFO sightings and the possibility of alien encounters.</p>
<p>The findings also highlight a divide in beliefs among political affiliations, with Democrats and Independents more likely to believe in alien existence compared to Republicans.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life continues to grow, researchers and government agencies may increase efforts to investigate sightings and reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. Further polling may also assess shifts in public opinion regarding alien encounters.</p>
