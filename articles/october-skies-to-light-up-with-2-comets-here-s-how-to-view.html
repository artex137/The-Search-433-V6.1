      <h2>October skies to light up with 2 comets. Here's how to view.</h2>

<p>Skywatchers have the opportunity to see two comets, C/2025 R2 (SWAN) and C/2025 A6 (Lemmon), this October, with peak visibility expected around October 21. Both comets are predicted to be visible in the western and southern skies approximately 45 minutes after sunset.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare chance to observe multiple comets in one month, which is uncommon. According to NASA, comets are remnants from the early solar system, made primarily of ice and organic material. Astronomers encourage the use of binoculars or telescopes to enhance the viewing experience.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comets:</strong> C/2025 R2 (SWAN) and C/2025 A6 (Lemmon)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> October 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Western and southern skies, 45 minutes after sunset</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness of SWAN:</strong> Magnitude +6.1, potentially visible to the naked eye on October 20</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness of Lemmon:</strong> Expected to reach magnitude 5 in mid-October, possibly brightening to magnitude 3 near perihelion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) has been tracked as it approaches Earth. It is expected to pass through various constellations including Libra, Scorpius, and Sagittarius throughout October. Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) will make its closest approach towards the end of October.</p>

<p>Visibility of Comet SWAN is anticipated to improve as mid-October approaches, allowing for better sightings with binoculars. Comet Lemmon will be best viewed in the evening sky during late October and into November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comets are remnants from the early stages of our solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago,” said NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are significant celestial events, providing insight into the early solar system. Observing two comets in a single month adds to the excitement for amateur and professional astronomers alike. Previous notable comet sightings have drawn attention and interest from the public, enhancing the appreciation for astronomical phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to prepare for viewing opportunities throughout October and into November as the comets approach their closest points to Earth. Continued updates from astronomy apps and websites will provide additional visibility information as the dates draw closer.</p>
