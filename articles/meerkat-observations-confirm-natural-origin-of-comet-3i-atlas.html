      <h2>MeerKAT Observations Confirm Natural Origin of Comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>Recent findings from the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa have strengthened the case for the natural origin of comet 3I/Atlas, which is currently making its closest approach to the sun. The observatory detected a radio signal from the interstellar object on October 24, just five days before its perihelion.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it counters speculation regarding the comet's potential technological origins, which have proliferated on social media and popular podcasts, including the Joe Rogan show. The data collected indicates a specific radio frequency pattern rather than a transmission from a spacecraft, reinforcing the understanding of comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detection occurred on October 24, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will reach its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>MeerKAT is operated by the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory and consists of 64 antennas.</li>
    <li>Detected radio frequencies were at 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz.</li>
    <li>Previous attempts to detect signals occurred on September 20 and 28, 2023, with no results.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 20 and 28, 2023, astronomers attempted to detect radio signals from comet 3I/Atlas but were unsuccessful. The successful detection occurred on October 24, 2023, just five days prior to the comet's closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2023.</p>

<p>As 3I/Atlas neared the sun, it exhibited observable effects due to the sublimation of ice and increased radiation. The MeerKAT telescope identified hydroxyl radicals through absorption lines, indicating typical comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of the hydroxyl absorption pattern is consistent with expected comet behavior,” said an unnamed scientist from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist advocating for the investigation of the comet's origins, stated, “Ongoing monitoring is essential to determine the consistency of the hydroxyl production and to examine further characteristics of the comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of radio signals from 3I/Atlas has reignited discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial technology, especially given its proximity to the area where the Wow! Signal was detected in 1977. Despite the lack of direct radio emissions, public interest in astrophysics and celestial studies has surged.</p>

<p>Speculation surrounding the comet's nature persists, largely fueled by Loeb's inquiries into its possible technological origins. The recent findings from MeerKAT may not completely quell these theories, but they provide significant evidence supporting the comet's natural characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas, especially as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026. The Juno spacecraft is scheduled to search for low-frequency radio signals during this time.</p>
