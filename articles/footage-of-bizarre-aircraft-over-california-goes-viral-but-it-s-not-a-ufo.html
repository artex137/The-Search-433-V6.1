      <h2>Footage Of Bizarre Aircraft Over California Goes Viral – But It's Not A UFO</h2>

<p>Footage of a large aircraft spotted over California in December 2025 has gone viral, but authorities have confirmed it is not an unidentified flying object (UFO). The aircraft is identified as the Roc, an experimental vehicle owned by the aerospace company Stratolaunch.</p>

<p>This incident highlights ongoing public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena. Stratolaunch has stated that the Roc plays a crucial role in advancing aerospace technology and testing capabilities for hypersonic vehicles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: December 2025</li>
    <li>Aircraft: Roc, owned by Stratolaunch</li>
    <li>Wingspan: 117 meters (385 feet)</li>
    <li>Weight at takeoff: 590,000 kilograms (1.3 million pounds)</li>
    <li>Payload capacity: Over 227,000 kilograms (500,000 pounds)</li>
    <li>Flight altitude: Reached 10,670 meters (35,000 feet) during tests in 2024</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, residents in California reported seeing a large aircraft in the sky. The sighting attracted attention due to its unusual appearance, leading many to speculate it was a UFO.</p>
<p>Authorities quickly identified the aircraft as Roc, an experimental vehicle used by Stratolaunch for aerospace testing. The Roc has been designed to carry and release rockets and hypersonic aircraft at high altitudes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Roc helps accelerate access to the hypersonic environment so our customers can achieve and our nation can advance,” said a representative from Stratolaunch.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Roc is the largest aircraft ever to fly, designed with two fuselages and one massive wing. It has become a focal point of interest due to its unique design and capabilities. Prior incidents of unidentified flying objects have often led to speculation and intrigue, dating back to the first recorded sighting in the U.S. in 1639.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Stratolaunch will continue its flight testing program, although no public testing calendar has been disclosed. The company aims to enhance its capabilities in hypersonic flight and aerospace vehicle technology.</p>
