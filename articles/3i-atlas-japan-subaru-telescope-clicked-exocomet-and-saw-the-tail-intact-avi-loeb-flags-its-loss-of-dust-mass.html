      <h2>Subaru Telescope Captures Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>The Subaru Telescope has captured images of Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, during a brief observation on December 13, 2025, from its base in Maunakea, Hawaii. The comet was approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth at the time of the observation, just before its closest approach on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insight into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, which has drawn attention from various space agencies and scientists. The National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) and the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS), which operate the Subaru Telescope, reported that the comet's tail was clearly visible in the captured images. Professor Avi Loeb from Harvard University has raised questions regarding the dust mass shed by the comet, suggesting it may not conform to conventional comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Observation of Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of observation: December 13, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 6 AM (UT)</li>
    <li>Observatory: Subaru Telescope, Maunakea, Hawaii</li>
    <li>Affiliated agencies: National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 13, 2025, between 5:35 and 5:43 AM (HST), the Subaru Telescope captured images of Comet 3I/ATLAS. The observation lasted a short time but clearly showed the comet's tail. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, around 6 AM (UT).</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“At the time of observation, just before its closest approach to Earth on December 19, it was approximately 270 million kilometers away—about 1.8 times the distance between the Sun and Earth,” the Subaru Telescope stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The total luminosity of the glow around 3I/ATLAS during the month after perihelion is equivalent to the reflection of sunlight from a spherical mirror of 10-kilometer radius,” Professor Loeb noted in his blog.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known object from outside the Solar System to be identified. Previous observations of comets have typically confirmed their characteristics as defined in conventional studies. However, 3I/ATLAS has prompted some academic debate regarding its anomalous features, particularly its dust and gas emissions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and analyses are expected as scientists continue to study Comet 3I/ATLAS and its properties in the coming months, particularly focusing on the implications of the dust mass and its origins.</p>
