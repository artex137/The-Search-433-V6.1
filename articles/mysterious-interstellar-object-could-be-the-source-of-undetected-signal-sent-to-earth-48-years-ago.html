      <h2>Mysterious interstellar object could be the source of undetected signal sent to Earth 48 years ago</h2>

<p>A mysterious space signal recorded in 1977 may have originated from the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The object is currently moving rapidly through our solar system and is expected to fly close to Mars on October 3, 2023. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it connects the unexplained "WOW! signal" captured by the Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope with 3I/ATLAS. Loeb has suggested that the object could be an alien spacecraft, although this claim remains speculative. Authorities, including NASA, are now monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely as it approaches Mars, hoping to gather more information about its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered by astronomers in summer 2023.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to pass closest to Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The WOW! signal was detected on August 12, 1977, for 72 seconds.</li>
    <li>The likelihood of 3I/ATLAS being the source of the WOW! signal is about 0.6 percent.</li>
    <li>Nasa has launched a new tracking system for 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 12, 1977, the WOW! signal was recorded by astronomers, showing unusual characteristics that sparked speculation about its origin. Just days later, 3I/ATLAS was in close proximity to the area of the sky where the signal was detected. In the summer of 2023, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS, which is now on a trajectory toward Mars.</p>

<p>As the object approaches Mars, NASA has initiated a tracking system to observe 3I/ATLAS, providing the scientific community with the opportunity to gather more data and insights.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If we detect an artificial signal from an interstellar object, how should we interact with it?” Avi Loeb stated in his recent paper. “We must consider the possibility of an unpredictable event from interstellar objects that resemble comets at great distances, but that could potentially have devastating consequences for our future, like a Trojan Horse.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The WOW! signal remains one of the most intriguing unsolved mysteries in radio astronomy, characterized by its narrow frequency band and high signal strength. While scientists have largely dismissed the idea of extraterrestrial origin, the connection to 3I/ATLAS has reignited interest in the signal. The interstellar object itself has been described as a strange comet with a unique chemical composition, differing from known comets in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, scientists will continue to monitor the object for any radio signals and gather further data. NASA's new tracking system will provide real-time information, aiding in the investigation of both the object and its potential link to the WOW! signal.</p>
