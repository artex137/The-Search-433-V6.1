      <h2>3I/ATLAS: NASA’s Fuzzy Image Of Interstellar Comet Triggers Memefest</h2>

<p>NASA has released a fuzzy image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a livestream on November 20, 2025, at 1:30 IST. The image, captured by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), shows the comet as it passed by Earth at a distance of 19 million miles (30 million kilometers).</p>

<p>This image has sparked widespread reactions online, with many users expressing disappointment over the quality of the photograph. The University of Arizona, which collaborates with NASA and JPL-Caltech on the project, explained that the HiRISE camera is not designed for long exposure images of distant objects, contributing to the image's blur.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Image taken on November 20, 2025, at 1:30 IST.</li>
    <li>Distance of comet 3I/ATLAS during observation: 19 million miles (30 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Camera used: HiRISE on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>Image scale: 30 kilometers per pixel.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third object discovered passing through our solar system from outside the galaxy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered. NASA and other space agencies have since coordinated observations of the comet as it travels through the solar system. The recent release of the fuzzy image occurred during a livestream event on November 20, 2025.</p>

<p>The University of Arizona noted that the image's quality was affected by spacecraft jitter during the observation period, causing the comet to appear smeared across several pixels. The comet's nucleus remains unresolved in the HiRISE image.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The nucleus, estimated from Hubble Space Telescope images to be at most a few kilometers across, cannot be resolved in our HiRISE image,” a representative from the University of Arizona stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Refinement of the data continues, but we can clearly see the coma,” the representative added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. It has exhibited anomalous behavior since its discovery, leading to various speculations, including theories of extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<p>Prior to this, NASA has released images of other celestial bodies, and the public has grown accustomed to high-quality visuals from space missions. The recent image has triggered a wave of memes and criticism online.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to refine the data collected from the HiRISE camera and other observations of 3I/ATLAS. Further updates and images are expected as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>
