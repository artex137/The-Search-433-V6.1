      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shock: Harvard Professor Avi Loeb Flags 15 'Anomalies' in Interstellar Object</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomer <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has identified 15 anomalies associated with the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, which entered the solar system in July 2025. The object's unusual features have raised questions about its origin and potential implications for humanity.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it challenges current scientific understanding and prompts increased scrutiny from both scientists and intelligence agencies. Authorities are closely monitoring the object's trajectory and characteristics, treating it as a critical planetary defense exercise.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Current Rank:</strong> 4 on the Loeb scale</li>
    <li><strong>Next Milestone:</strong> Closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 58 kilometres per second</li>
    <li><strong>Anomalies Identified:</strong> 15</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, swiftly capturing the attention of the scientific community. Shortly after its identification, Loeb assigned it a ranking of 4 on the Loeb scale due to its unusual behaviour. On October 29, 2025, he noted eight anomalies, which have since increased to 15 as more data became available. The object is expected to reach its closest point to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, marking a significant point for ongoing analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Most likely is not the same as certain,” Loeb said in a recent interview, emphasizing the need to consider various possibilities regarding the object's origin.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb compared the situation to Pascal's Wager, stating that “the risks of being wrong are so high that one must act as if the unlikely event is true.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar objects such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have also sparked significant scientific interest. Loeb's scale, which ranks cosmic objects based on their potential threat level, has become a key tool in assessing risks associated with such anomalies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, scientists and intelligence agencies will continue to monitor the object closely. The analysis of its anomalies is expected to inform future planetary defense strategies and enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
