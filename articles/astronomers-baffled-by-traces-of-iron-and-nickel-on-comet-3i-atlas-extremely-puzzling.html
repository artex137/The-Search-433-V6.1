      <h2>Astronomers baffled by traces of iron and nickel on comet 3I/ATLAS: 'Extremely puzzling'</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered unusually high amounts of iron and nickel in the gas plume of comet 3I/ATLAS, according to data from the European Very Large Telescope’s Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES). The findings emerged as astronomers continue to observe the interstellar visitor, which is currently on its trajectory towards the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it challenges existing knowledge about comet compositions. Researchers are working to understand how these metals are present in the comet's coma, given the low temperatures at such distances. The findings may provide insights into the diversity of interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has shown an "extreme abundance ratio" of nickel and iron.</li>
    <li>Nickel was detected in all readings, while iron appeared when the comet was within 2.64 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet measures approximately three miles in diameter and has an estimated mass of 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>The abundance ratios detected differ from those found in solar system comets, including 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>This discovery occurred during ongoing observations as the comet approaches the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As astronomers have monitored comet 3I/ATLAS, they have made several key observations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The comet was first identified as an interstellar visitor.</li>
    <li>Recent studies revealed its unusual size and mass, measuring three miles in diameter and weighing 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Data from UVES have shown high levels of nickel and iron, leading to new hypotheses about its composition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “At the distances at which comets are observed, the temperature is far too low to vaporize silicate, sulfide, and metallic grains that contain nickel and iron atoms,” researchers noted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Therefore, the presence of nickel and iron atoms in cometary coma is extremely puzzling,” researchers added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb stated, “The abundance ratio of nickel and iron detected in the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov was similar to that of solar system comets.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery follows a trend of increasing interest in interstellar objects. Comet 2I/Borisov, observed in 2019, had a different composition than typical solar system comets, highlighting the diversity among these celestial bodies. The findings from 3I/ATLAS may further illuminate the differences between interstellar and solar system comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, aiming to gather more data on its composition and behavior. Further observations may clarify the origins of the detected metals and enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
