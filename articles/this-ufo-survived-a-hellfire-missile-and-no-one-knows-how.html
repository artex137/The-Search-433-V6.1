      <h2>This UFO Survived A Hellfire Missile And No One Knows How</h2>

<p>A video showing a glowing orb surviving a Hellfire missile strike off the coast of Yemen has raised questions about unidentified flying objects, or UAPs, during a House Government Oversight subcommittee hearing in September 2025. The orb was reportedly struck on October 30, 2024, in what was an active combat zone, but there have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the incident.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as it highlights ongoing investigations into UAPs by the U.S. government. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has received numerous reports of UAPs, prompting authorities to examine these phenomena using a scientific framework. The video footage has sparked interest and concern among military personnel and lawmakers regarding the nature and origin of these unidentified objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident Date: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Video Release: September 2025</li>
    <li>Agency: All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)</li>
    <li>New Reports: 757 UAP incident reports from May 2023 to June 2024</li>
    <li>Unexplained Reports: 21 cases that AARO could not explain</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2023, AARO began collecting incident reports from military and civilian pilots, leading to a total of 757 new reports by June 2024. On October 30, 2024, the glowing orb was recorded being struck by a Hellfire missile during a U.S. Navy operation aimed at protecting commercial shipping lanes from Houthi militants. The missile, instead of destroying the orb, appeared to bounce off it, sending debris flying.</p>

<p>In September 2025, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets convened a hearing where the footage was presented. Testimonies from three Air Force personnel indicated that the event was unsettling, as they expressed disbelief that any American technology could survive such an attack.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No American technology could survive this type of strike,” said one Air Force personnel during the hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The video scares us,” another Air Force member remarked, highlighting the concerns among military witnesses.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The U.S. government's interest in UAPs has increased significantly since the establishment of AARO in July 2022. The agency aims to investigate UAPs thoroughly, employing a rigorous scientific approach to understand these phenomena. The recent influx of reports indicates a growing awareness and concern regarding UAPs among military and civilian pilots alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the UAP incident off Yemen are ongoing, with AARO expected to continue analyzing the data and reports collected. Further hearings may be convened to address the implications of the findings and the nature of the objects involved.</p>
