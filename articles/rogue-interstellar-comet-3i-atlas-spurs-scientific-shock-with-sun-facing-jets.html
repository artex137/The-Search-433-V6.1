      <h2>Rogue Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Spurs Scientific Shock With Sun-Facing Jets</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed unprecedented features as it travels through our solar system, drawing attention from scientists worldwide. Discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile, this comet has shown tightly collimated streams of dust directed toward the Sun, a phenomenon captured in high-resolution images by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing models of cometary behavior. Researchers are currently analyzing the comet's unique features, which may provide critical insights into the nature of interstellar objects and their interaction with solar radiation. The findings have sparked extensive scientific debate and scrutiny, underscoring the need for revised theoretical frameworks.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It has an origin confirmed outside the solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at speeds exceeding 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>High-resolution images were captured by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on 30 October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA scientists have confirmed the unusual jet structures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025. Following its discovery, astronomers noted its hyperbolic orbit, confirming its interstellar origin. The comet entered the solar system and reached perihelion on 30 October 2025. During this period, multiple observatories, including Hubble, SOHO, and James Webb, collected data to analyze the comet's behavior.</p>

<p>On 19 November 2025, NASA/ESA scientists participated in a live webcast discussing the comet's properties and emphasizing that it poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a rare laboratory for studying pristine material from another star system,” said a mission scientist during the NASA/ESA live webcast.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/&#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of these objects provides important insights into the diversity of planetary system debris and conditions beyond our solar neighborhood. Previous encounters with interstellar objects have led to a reevaluation of our understanding of cometary physics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS exits the solar system, scientists will continue to analyze the data collected to refine models of cometary behavior and interstellar object interactions. This research may help reshape our understanding of cosmic visitors and their implications for the formation and evolution of planetary systems.</p>
