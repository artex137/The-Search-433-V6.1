      <h2>Trump orders release of US files on aliens and UFOs</h2>

<p>Donald Trump has ordered the release of files related to alien life held by the United States, according to a statement on his Truth Social account on February 20, 2026. Trump directed government agencies to begin the process of sharing information on extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs).</p>

<p>This announcement comes in response to growing public interest in the topic. Trump has cited the "tremendous interest" shown by the public as a reason for the release. He described the matters as "extremely interesting and important" and stated that relevant departments would identify and release information connected to these issues.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump made the announcement on February 20, 2026.</li>
    <li>The directive applies to the Secretary of War and other relevant departments and agencies.</li>
    <li>Trump's comments follow a podcast by former President Barack Obama, who suggested that aliens might exist.</li>
    <li>Public interest in UFOs surged after leaked Navy videos in 2017.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon created the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in July 2022.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, a group of former Pentagon officials leaked Navy videos of unidentified objects, prompting renewed public interest in UFOs. In May 2022, Congress held its first hearings on UFOs in 50 years, although officials indicated that the objects observed were likely drones. Following these developments, the Pentagon established the AARO to centralize reports of military UFO encounters.</p>

<p>In June 2024, an 18-page unclassified report submitted to Congress noted that military service members had made 485 reports of unidentified phenomena in the previous year. Of those, 118 cases were identified as benign objects, such as balloons and birds.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>

    "Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life."

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Public interest in UFOs has fluctuated, with a significant resurgence following the release of Navy videos in 2017. The establishment of the AARO has aimed to improve transparency regarding military encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena. In 2023, Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, then head of AARO, stated that there was no evidence of a program for reverse engineering extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The government is expected to begin the process of releasing the files, although specific timelines and details have not been disclosed. Further investigations may follow, depending on the content of the released information.</p>
