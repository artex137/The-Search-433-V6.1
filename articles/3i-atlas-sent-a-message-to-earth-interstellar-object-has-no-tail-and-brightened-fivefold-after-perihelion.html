      <h2>3I/ATLAS Sends Message to Earth, Brightens Fivefold After Perihelion</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has sent a message to Earth following its perihelion passage on October 29, 2025, raising interest among scientists, according to social media claims. The interstellar object has no visible tail and has brightened fivefold, although these claims remain unverified.</p>

<p>This development has prompted NASA and Harvard scientist Avi Loeb to share new data about 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may not be a typical comet. The unusual behavior of the object, including unexplained acceleration and metallic composition, has led to discussions about its origin and whether it is a natural or artificial object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness increase:</strong> Fivefold</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 206 million km</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of discovery:</strong> Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Notable characteristics:</strong> No visible tail, metallic composition</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's planned observation:</strong> James Webb Space Telescope in December</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope. The object passed its perihelion on October 29, 2025, and subsequently brightened fivefold without developing a visible tail. Reports of its unusual acceleration and composition have emerged since then.</p>

<p>NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Minor Planet Center have noted that 3I/ATLAS is moving faster than expected, suggesting influences beyond gravity. According to claims, this acceleration may indicate an internal mechanism similar to propulsion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “If 3I/ATLAS were losing mass naturally, it should have produced visible gas jets. Since none are detected, we are exploring other explanations.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic orbit confirms that it does not circle the Sun in the same manner as typical comets or planets. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have led to speculation about its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to use the James Webb Space Telescope in December to further investigate 3I/ATLAS. Scientists will monitor its motion, color, and brightness to determine whether it is a natural object or an artificial visitor to our Solar System.</p>
