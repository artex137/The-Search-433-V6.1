      <h2>Hyperbolic trajectory of comet 3I/ATLAS confirms origin outside the solar system</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, follows a hyperbolic orbit and will leave the solar system after its passage by the Sun. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units (210 million km) from the Sun, and has increased its speed to approximately 244,000 km/h.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it confirms the comet's interstellar origin and offers insights into planetary formation in other star systems. NASA has coordinated a global monitoring campaign involving multiple observatories to study the comet's trajectory and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Current speed:</strong> 244,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum distance from Earth:</strong> 270 million km in December</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Venus:</strong> 97 million km in November</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Jupiter:</strong> 54 million km in March 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Rich in carbon dioxide</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated age:</strong> 7 to 14 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun. Observations by the James Webb telescope in August identified a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the comet's coma. NASA has coordinated monitoring efforts with Hubble telescopes and other space missions since November 2025.</p>

<p>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth in December 2025, at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units. It will pass Venus in November and Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The hyperbolic orbit with eccentricity greater than 6 ensures that 3I/ATLAS will not be captured by the Sun,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This trajectory suggests that it was ejected from another stellar system billions of years ago.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique composition, including a predominance of carbon dioxide, challenges traditional comet models and enhances understanding of interstellar chemistry.</p>

<p>Previous studies of interstellar objects have provided valuable data about the formation of planetary systems outside our own, and 3I/ATLAS adds to this growing body of knowledge.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and collect data until January 2026, when visibility is expected to decrease. Observatories around the world will participate in this ongoing study to enhance understanding of extrasolar objects.</p>
