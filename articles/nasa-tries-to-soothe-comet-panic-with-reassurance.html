      <h2>NASA tries to soothe comet panic with reassurance</h2>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have assured the public that interstellar comet 3I Atlas poses no danger to Earth, following widespread panic fueled by social media claims. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, has captured the attention of astronomers as only the third interstellar visitor ever recorded.</p>

<p>This reassurance is crucial as misinformation has spread rapidly across platforms like TikTok, X, and Reddit. Space agencies have stepped up to clarify the comet's trajectory, which keeps it safely hundreds of millions of kilometers away from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It passed Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometers on July 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed exceeding 210,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>3I Atlas will reach its nearest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at approximately 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus diameter ranges between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope discovered interstellar comet 3I Atlas. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on July 21, 2025, passing at a distance of 270 million kilometers. As misinformation began to spread online, NASA and ESA issued statements to clarify the comet's trajectory and safety. The comet is set to reach its nearest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Comet 3I Atlas poses no risk to Earth whatsoever," NASA stated. "The object is simply passing safely through our solar system and provides scientists with a valuable research opportunity."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    The ESA confirmed, "Atlas maintains a trajectory more than 2.5 times the distance between Earth and the Sun, making any possibility of impact completely impossible."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects have sparked similar public interest and misinformation. The arrival of 3I Atlas provides researchers with an opportunity to study materials from beyond our solar system, which can yield insights into the chemistry and structure of distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to track the comet’s path and analyze its properties throughout October 2025, maintaining their message that Earth remains entirely safe from any potential threat.</p>
