      <h2>Physicist Michio Kaku Accuses NASA of Withholding 3I/ATLAS Data Amid Rising Speculation</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has come under increased scrutiny as theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku has accused NASA of withholding critical data regarding its behavior and composition. The object was first detected on July 1, 2025, and is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to enter the Solar System.</p>

<p>Dr. Kaku's accusations have sparked a debate among scientists and the public about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, especially following its recent loss of a cometary tail after passing the Sun. This development has raised concerns about transparency from NASA and has led to calls for the agency to share more information regarding the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interstellar object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First detected: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the Solar System</li>
    <li>Recent event: Loss of cometary tail after passing the Sun</li>
    <li>Accusation: Michio Kaku claims NASA is withholding data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. Since then, it has been observed closely by scientists. The object recently lost its cometary tail after passing the Sun, which has led to increased public interest and speculation about its properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA must provide greater transparency regarding 3I/ATLAS to address the concerns of both the scientific community and the public,” Dr. Kaku stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a trend of public interest in interstellar objects, particularly after the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The behavior of these objects often leads to discussions about their origins and the implications for our understanding of the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Calls for transparency from NASA are likely to continue, as scientists and the public await further data on 3I/ATLAS. The agency's response may influence future investigations into interstellar objects.</p>
