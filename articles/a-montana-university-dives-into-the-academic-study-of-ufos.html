      <h2>A Montana University Dives Into The Academic Study Of UFOs</h2>

<p>Montana Technological University in Butte has announced it will offer classes focused on the academic study of UFOs, marking a significant step in the field as interest in the phenomenon grows. The courses will be led by Dr. Michael P. Masters, an author and professor, who aims to explore the implications of UFO sightings and evidence.</p>

<p>This initiative is notable as it positions Montana Tech among the first universities in the United States to take UFO studies seriously. With the recent release of government documents confirming the existence of unidentified flying objects, the academic community is beginning to acknowledge the importance of this subject. The classes aim to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of UFO phenomena, although no degree in this area is currently offered.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
