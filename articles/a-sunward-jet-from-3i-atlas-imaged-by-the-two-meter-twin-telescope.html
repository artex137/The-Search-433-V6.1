      <h2>A Sunward Jet from 3I/ATLAS, Imaged by the Two-meter Twin Telescope</h2>

<p>A new image of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been captured by the Two-meter Twin Telescope (TtT) at the Teide Observatory in the Canary Islands, Spain, on August 2, 2025. The image shows a sunward jet extending approximately 6,000 kilometers from the nucleus of the comet. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical observation.</p>

<p>This discovery adds to the growing interest in 3I/ATLAS, which has displayed unusual characteristics compared to typical comets. The findings have prompted further investigation into the nature of its sunward jet and the implications of its unique features. Authorities in the field, including astronomers and comet experts, are discussing the significance of these anomalies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: August 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Teide Observatory, Canary Islands, Spain</li>
    <li>Distance of jet from nucleus: approximately 6,000 kilometers</li>
    <li>Number of exposures in image: 159</li>
    <li>Exposure duration per image: 50 seconds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, an image of 3I/ATLAS was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, revealing an extended glow and an anti-tail directed toward the Sun. This sparked excitement among comet researchers, although the implications of the anti-tail were not fully explored.</p>

<p>On August 2, 2025, the Two-meter Twin Telescope captured a new image of 3I/ATLAS, confirming the existence of a sunward jet. This image further complicates the understanding of the comet's behavior and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The existence of an anti-tail pointed towards the Sun is an anomaly that raises two questions: What is the nature of the anti-tail? Why are comet experts ignoring this anomaly while insisting that 3I/ATLAS is a familiar comet?” – Avi Loeb, co-author of the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS challenges existing theories about comets, which typically have tails that point away from the Sun due to solar radiation and wind. Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have displayed different characteristics, making 3I/ATLAS a subject of significant interest among scientists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb and Eric Keto are working on a follow-up paper to explore the nature of the anti-tail and its implications. Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are expected, especially as it approaches spacecraft such as the Europa Clipper and Hera in the coming month.</p>
