      <h2>Scientists Scan Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS for Alien Signals — and Find Nothing</h2>

<p>On January 4, 2026, researchers from Breakthrough Listen have reported no detections of artificial radio signals from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. The search occurred just before the comet's closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it reinforces the understanding that 3I/ATLAS is a natural object, despite ongoing speculation online about its behavior. The comet is only the third confirmed interstellar object, and its passage presents a limited opportunity for close observations. The study's results arrive amid heightened public interest in the comet, spurred by claims of unusual features that some have linked to technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of report: January 4, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: Green Bank Telescope, West Virginia</li>
    <li>Frequency range searched: 1–12 GHz</li>
    <li>Detection threshold: down to 100 mW</li>
    <li>Number of known interstellar objects: three</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Breakthrough Listen conducted observations of 3I/ATLAS using the 100-meter Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope just before the comet's closest approach to Earth. The team initially detected signals, but through analysis, they determined these were human-made radio interference.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, has noted unusual jet patterns in Hubble images of the comet, suggesting further investigation may be warranted. He has highlighted the significance of these patterns, estimating a 0.2% probability of their alignment occurring by chance.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We report a nondetection of candidate signals down to the 100 mW level,” said Ben Jacobson-Bell in a preprint posted on arXiv.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nasa officials stated that 3I/ATLAS “looks and behaves like a comet,” noting its coma and tail of dust, and confirmed it poses no threat to Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The lack of detection does not diminish scientific interest in 3I/ATLAS, as scientists emphasize the rarity of interstellar objects and their potential to provide insights into planetary system formation. The comet has also sparked discussions on global readiness to study such objects, with some experts advocating for enhanced survey capabilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS and monitor future interstellar objects to gain further insights into their characteristics and origins.</p>
