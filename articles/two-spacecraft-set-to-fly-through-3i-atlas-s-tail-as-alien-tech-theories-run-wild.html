      <h2>Two spacecraft set to fly through 3I/ATLAS’s tail as alien tech theories run wild</h2>

<p>Two spacecraft, Europa Clipper and Hera, are set to fly through the tail of comet 3I/ATLAS on October 29, 2023. The object, which is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected, has sparked speculation about its nature, with some theorizing it could be an alien mothership. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it may provide crucial data about 3I/ATLAS, which has baffled scientists since its discovery. NASA maintains it is a comet, while others, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, suggest it could be something more advanced. Both spacecraft will be in the vicinity of the comet's ion tail during a unique cosmic alignment.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Spacecraft:</strong> Europa Clipper (NASA) and Hera (European Space Agency)</li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Chance of alien technology:</strong> 40% (according to Avi Loeb)</li>
    <li><strong>Data collection window:</strong> October 30 to November 6, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected as it entered the solar system. It has since exhibited unusual characteristics, including rapid spinning and a strange glow. On October 29, both Europa Clipper and Hera will be in the same area as the comet's expected ion tail.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb has voiced concerns about the implications of the comet, suggesting it could either disintegrate or release mini-probes as it approaches the sun. His predictions have raised awareness about potential contact with alien technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, "If it doesn’t disintegrate, it could release mini-probes as a technological mothership." He has urged world leaders to prepare for potential first contact scenarios, emphasizing that "a visitor in our backyard requires immediate attention because it could pose an imminent threat."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb has submitted a white paper to the United Nations advocating for an international response plan. He remarked, "There are no protocols for responding to the discovery of functioning alien devices near Earth."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS adds to a growing list of interstellar objects that challenge conventional understanding of celestial bodies. The recent report from NASA regarding potential ancient alien life on Mars has intensified public interest in extraterrestrial phenomena.</p>
<p>Previous incidents involving unidentified aerial phenomena have led to increased scrutiny of government protocols regarding potential alien contact.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The upcoming flyby of 3I/ATLAS will be closely monitored by both NASA and the European Space Agency. Data collection efforts will depend on solar wind conditions from October 30 to November 6. Further analysis and potential follow-up studies are expected based on the findings from this encounter.</p>
