      <h2>NASA interstellar comet 3I ATLAS approaching December 19 reveals life's building blocks</h2>

<p>Astronomers have tracked the NASA interstellar comet 3I ATLAS, which is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units (268 million kilometers). Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed the comet is releasing significant amounts of methanol, hydrogen cyanide, and carbon dioxide—key chemical compounds associated with the origins of life.</p>

<p>This discovery is crucial for understanding the potential for life beyond Earth. Scientists are currently analyzing the comet's chemical composition to learn more about how these organic compounds may have formed and spread throughout the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observed the comet on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Astronomers detected methanol, hydrogen cyanide, and carbon dioxide in the comet's composition.</li>
    <li>The comet releases approximately 20 grams per second of cyanide.</li>
    <li>3I ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope in Chile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I ATLAS has unfolded as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>July 1, 2025: The comet is first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>November 30, 2025: The Hubble Space Telescope captures images of the comet, revealing its chemical activity.</li>
    <li>December 19, 2025: The comet will make its closest approach to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The presence of these organic compounds in 3I ATLAS challenges our understanding of how life’s building blocks form and spread throughout the galaxy,” said a lead astronomer involved in the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, scientists believed that comets primarily delivered water and organic materials to early Earth. The findings regarding 3I ATLAS suggest that similar organic chemistry may exist throughout interstellar space, potentially reshaping theories about the prevalence of life in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the comet's closest approach, scientists will continue to observe 3I ATLAS to gather more data about its chemical composition and activity levels. This represents a unique opportunity for researchers to study an interstellar object from within our solar system before it returns to interstellar space.</p>
