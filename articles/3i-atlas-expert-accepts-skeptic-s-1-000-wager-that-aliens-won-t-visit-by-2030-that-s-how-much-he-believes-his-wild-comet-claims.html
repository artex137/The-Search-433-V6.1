      <h2>3I/ATLAS expert accepts skeptic’s $1,000 wager that aliens won’t visit by 2030</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has accepted a wager from Dr. Michael Shermer, publisher of Skeptic magazine, regarding the potential visitation of aliens by the year 2030. The bet was made public on November 26, 2025, and centers on the claim that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could provide evidence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This wager highlights ongoing debates in the scientific community about the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence. Loeb believes that confirmation from major scientific institutions could occur within the next seven years. Shermer, a noted skeptic, has challenged the credibility of such claims, emphasizing the lack of tangible proof for alien contact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb has accepted a $1,000 bet from Dr. Michael Shermer.</li>
    <li>The wager states that aliens will not visit Earth by December 31, 2030.</li>
    <li>Confirmation of extraterrestrial intelligence must come from at least two of the following institutions: NASA, the National Science Foundation, or the American Astronomical Society.</li>
    <li>The wager will be decided based on the discovery of UAPs, UFOs, or other interstellar objects deemed to be of extraterrestrial origin.</li>
    <li>Loeb has linked the bet to the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, which he claims exhibits “anomalies.”</li>
    <li>Proceeds from the wager will go to the Galileo Project Foundation, which Loeb leads.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 26, 2025, Avi Loeb accepted a wager from Dr. Michael Shermer regarding the visitation of aliens by 2030. Shermer issued the bet through the Long Now Foundation’s Long Bets program, a platform for making competitive predictions. The conditions of the wager require confirmation from major scientific institutions about extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
<p>Loeb cited the recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS as a significant factor in his optimism about finding evidence of extraterrestrial life. He believes that the object may have unusual characteristics that could indicate the presence of a technological civilization.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The only way the conversation can change is if most reasonable people agree that we have a neighbor and something that was not produced by us happened to be found,” said Loeb. “I very much hope it’ll happen.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“After 33 years of documenting UFOlogist predictions that ET arrival is imminent, I have yet to have proof of alien contact,” Shermer stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This wager is part of a broader conversation about the search for extraterrestrial life, which has gained traction in recent years. Advocates argue that advancements in technology and discoveries of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS may provide opportunities to explore these possibilities more seriously. However, skeptics point to historical claims of alien contact that remain unverified.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The wager will remain open until December 31, 2030, during which time both sides will await developments in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The outcome will depend on whether any of the specified institutions confirm the existence of alien life or technology by that date.</p>
