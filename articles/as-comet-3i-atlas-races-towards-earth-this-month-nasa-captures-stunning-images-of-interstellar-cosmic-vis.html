      <h2>As comet 3I/ATLAS races towards Earth this month, NASA captures stunning images of interstellar cosmic visitor</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention from astronomers as it approaches Earth, set to fly closest on December 19 at a distance of 170 million miles (about 274 million kilometers). NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet on November 30, while it was approximately 178 million miles (286 million kilometers) from our planet. Authorities have confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed object from outside our solar system. NASA has mobilized various missions to observe the comet and enhance understanding of interstellar bodies. Observations are expected to continue for several months as the comet travels through our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass within 170 million miles of Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was last observed by Hubble on November 30, 2023, at 178 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory, moving too fast to be bound by the Sun's gravity.</li>
    <li>Earth is approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA reports that the comet poses no risk to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 as it entered the solar system. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope first observed the comet shortly after its discovery. On November 30, 2023, Hubble captured detailed images of the comet when it was 178 million miles from Earth. The comet is expected to come closest to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“So we use all the tools at our disposal to observe it before it disappears back into the cosmic dark,” said NASA, emphasizing the importance of studying the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third object confirmed to have originated outside our solar system. Its visit has been closely monitored by various satellites, space telescopes, and other missions, highlighting the growing interest in interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to observe comet 3I/ATLAS for several months as it exits the solar system, aiming to deepen scientific understanding of such interstellar visitors.</p>
