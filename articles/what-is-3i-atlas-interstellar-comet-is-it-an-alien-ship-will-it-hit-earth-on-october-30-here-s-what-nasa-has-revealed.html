      <h2>What Is Comet 3I/ATLAS?</h2>
<p>Mumbai, October 28: Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object discovered by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile, has attracted significant attention as it approaches the Sun, with a close point expected around October 30, 2025. There have been no injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This comet’s unusual orbit and speed have led to speculation, including theories that it might be an alien spacecraft. However, NASA and astronomers have emphasized that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, prompting ongoing studies to track its trajectory and behaviour as it nears the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at about 1.4 astronomical units (approximately 210 million km) away.</li>
    <li>The comet's nearest approach to Earth will be about 1.8 AU (approximately 170 million miles).</li>
    <li>Scientists estimate the size of the comet to be between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometres across.</li>
    <li>NASA expects the comet to remain visible to ground-based telescopes through September 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. Since then, it has been monitored by NASA and other major observatories as it travels through the solar system. As it approaches the Sun, scientists have observed a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust surrounding its icy core, indicating natural outgassing as it warms.</p>
<p>The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, and will not pose a threat to Earth during this time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS shows no artificial characteristics, only those typical of a natural comet, a mix of ice, rock, and dust,” NASA stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While it may not be visible to the naked eye, telescopes will capture its passage, a spectacular but harmless cosmic event,” NASA added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discoveries of other interstellar objects, specifically Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These previous discoveries have sparked interest in the study of interstellar material and how comets form in different star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Observations will help researchers gather data on its composition and behaviour. The comet is expected to reappear on the opposite side of the Sun by early December 2025.</p>
