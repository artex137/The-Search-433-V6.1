      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Ahead Of Earth Flyby Here Are 14 Anomalies Spotted By Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb On The Exocomet</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has identified 14 anomalies related to the comet 3I/ATLAS ahead of its flyby of Earth, scheduled for March 16, 2026, at a distance of 53.445 million kilometers from Jupiter. There are no reported injuries or fatalities linked to this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS could release technological devices as artificial satellites of Jupiter. The proximity of the comet to Jupiter's Hill radius may facilitate minimal fuel requirements for orbital corrections. Researchers are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and behavior as the encounter date approaches.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>Forecasted perijove distance is 53.445 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Distance is identical to Jupiter’s Hill radius of 53.502 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration was observed near perihelion.</li>
    <li>Potential release of technological devices at Jupiter’s Lagrange points L1 and L2.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS is expected to encounter Jupiter. The comet's behavior has been under study, particularly its non-gravitational acceleration observed near perihelion, which has allowed for precise predictions of its path.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The match in distance may indicate that 3I/ATLAS intends to release technological devices as artificial satellites of Jupiter,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its unique trajectory and behavior, particularly its non-gravitational acceleration, which has drawn the attention of astrophysicists. The comet's approach to Jupiter raises questions about its potential interactions with the planet's gravitational field.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, focusing on its trajectory and any anomalies that may arise leading up to the flyby.</p>
