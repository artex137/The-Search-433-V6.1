      <h2>Alien comet 3I/ATLAS set to stun Earth with closest approach</h2>

<p>A comet known as 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth and will make its closest approach on October 30, 2025, coming within 1.8 astronomical units, or approximately 167 million miles, from our planet. The comet has exhibited unusual behavior, including a massive jet of gas and dust directed towards the Sun, captivating astronomers worldwide.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the comet's unique characteristics. It is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Authorities and astronomers are preparing for this rare opportunity to study the comet's behavior as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach date: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 1.8 astronomical units (167 million miles)</li>
    <li>Comet size: Estimated nucleus under 1 km wide</li>
    <li>Composition: Carbon dioxide, cyanide, atomic nickel vapor</li>
    <li>Current brightness: Magnitude 12–14</li>
    <li>Viewing requirements: Telescope with at least an 8-inch (200 mm) aperture</li>
    <li>Next expected viewing window: Early December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed since its grand debut in July 2025. It displayed unexpected behavior, including a massive jet of gas and dust observed on August 2, 2025, by the Two-meter Twin Telescope at Spain’s Teide Observatory.</p>
<p>As it nears its closest approach to Earth, astronomers are closely monitoring the comet's activity and preparing to capture more data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet’s tail facing away from the Sun is the usual behavior — classic comet physics in action,” said astrophysicist Miquel Serra-Ricart.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Harvard’s Avi Loeb suggested, “This visitor might be more spaceship than snowball — a ‘Trojan horse’ of outer space secrets.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its rich chemical composition and hyperbolic trajectory, which means it is on a one-time pass through the solar system. Unlike typical comets that return multiple times, this comet is likely to vanish back into deep space after its closest approach.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar visitors, such as ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have sparked significant interest in the scientific community, leading to ongoing research into the origins and nature of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, astronomers will continue to monitor its activity and gather data. Observations are expected to resume in early December 2025, when it reappears after passing close to the Sun.</p>
