      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth in December and scientists debate its unique interstellar origin</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object ever cataloged, is set to reach its closest proximity to Earth on December 19, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, the comet has sparked intense scientific debate due to its unusual characteristics, including high speed and varying colors. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with its approach.</p>

<p>This event holds significance for astronomers as it offers a new opportunity for observation and study. The comet's unique features, including its record speed and chromatic changes, provide valuable insights into the formation and dynamics of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System. NASA and other astronomical organizations are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to gather data that could help clarify its origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million km.</li>
    <li>Travels through the Solar System at a speed of 60 km/s.</li>
    <li>First observed as reddish, later changing to green and blue hues.</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed no signals deviating from expected comet behavior were detected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Initial analyses indicated its record speed of 60 km/s, surpassing previous interstellar comets 1I/âOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. In September, the comet began exhibiting a green hue, later shifting to blue by the end of October. The comet reached perihelion in mid-October, becoming twice as bright as usual for its type. NASA released an official statement in October confirming that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a typical comet despite its unusual properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite having some interesting properties that are a little different from comets in our Solar System, it behaves like a comet,” said Tom Statler, NASA's chief scientist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet identified, making it a critical object for scientific study. Its unique characteristics have led to discussions within the scientific community regarding the nature of interstellar objects and their potential implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The global astronomical community will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS leading up to its closest approach, gathering data to further investigate its origins and behavior.</p>
