      <h2>Search for technosignals on comet 3I/ATLAS ends without evidence of artificial origin</h2>

<p>The search for technosignals from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has concluded without finding evidence of artificial origins. The observations were carried out on December 18, 2025, one day before the comet passed its closest approach to Earth at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This search is significant as it forms part of the Breakthrough Listen program, which aims to detect signs of extraterrestrial technology. Authorities have stated that despite extensive analysis, no artificial signals were identified, underscoring the natural astrophysical characteristics of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted using the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope on December 18, 2025.</li>
    <li>Initial detection of over 471,000 signal candidates narrowed down to nine potential events.</li>
    <li>All nine events identified as terrestrial radiofrequency noise or known contaminants.</li>
    <li>Comet exhibited typical characteristics, including a coma and tail.</li>
    <li>Breakthrough Listen program is dedicated to searching for extraterrestrial intelligence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was identified on July 1, 2025, and confirmed to have a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its origin outside the Solar System. The comet displayed cometary activity from its discovery, with a visible coma and tail.</p>

<p>On December 18, 2025, researchers conducted observations using the Green Bank Telescope, analyzing radio frequencies between 1 and 12 GHz. They initially detected more than 471,000 signal candidates but filtered these down to nine events. These events were determined to be terrestrial noise, with no signals matching the expected patterns from the comet's motion.</p>

<p>The comet passed safely near Earth on December 19, 2025, allowing for detailed observations to take place without risk.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The study reinforces that there is no evidence of artificial transmitters at the comet’s location,” said a representative from the Breakthrough Listen program.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Despite the rarity of interstellar objects, data indicate a natural astrophysical nature,” the representative added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. The comet's discovery generated speculation about the possibility of artificial origins, which has been a topic of interest in the scientific community. Previous searches for technosignals have also yielded no evidence of extraterrestrial technology, reinforcing the findings of this latest investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Continuous monitoring of 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects will take place using optical and infrared telescopes. Researchers emphasize the need for thorough investigations due to the limited number of known interstellar objects. Data collected is publicly available for independent analysis, and ground-based telescopes remain vigilant for new discoveries.</p>
