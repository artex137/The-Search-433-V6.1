      <h2>The New UFO Documentary the Government Does Want You to See</h2>

<p>UFO documentary <strong>The Age of Disclosure</strong> premiered at a special screening on Capitol Hill on Monday, ahead of its streaming release. The film, directed by Dan Farah, features 34 current and former senior members of government, military, and intelligence groups discussing what they claim is an 80-year conspiracy to conceal evidence of nonhuman intelligence.</p>

<p>This documentary matters as it highlights ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and government transparency. Notably, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is among the prominent officials featured, addressing the repeated sightings of unidentified objects over nuclear facilities.</p>
