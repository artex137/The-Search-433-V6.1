      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shock: ESA XMM-Newton Telescope Detects Mysterious X-Ray Glow From Alien Comet</h2>

<p>Scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA) have confirmed that their XMM-Newton space telescope detected a faint X-ray glow from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The discovery occurred on 3 December 2025, as the comet approached Earth, approximately 282 to 285 million kilometres away from the spacecraft.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it offers researchers a new method to study how interstellar objects interact with the Sun's influence. ESA officials noted that understanding these interactions could provide insights into the origins and compositions of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li>Date of observation: 3 December 2025</li>
  <li>Distance from Earth: 282 to 285 million kilometres</li>
  <li>Telescope used: ESA's XMM-Newton</li>
  <li>Observation duration: Approximately 20 hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 3 December 2025, ESA's XMM-Newton telescope tracked 3I/ATLAS for about 20 hours. During this time, scientists observed a faint glow of low-energy X-rays emitted from the comet as it interacted with the solar wind.</p>

<p>The XMM-Newton used its most sensitive instrument, the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC-pn), to capture images of the comet. The results highlighted a distinct glow, with red areas indicating emissions from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  "Astronomers expected to see this glow because when gas molecules streaming from the comet collide with the solar wind, they produce X-rays," ESA stated.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  "This makes X-ray observations a powerful tool. They allow scientists to detect and study gases that other instruments can't easily spot," ESA added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique due to its origin from outside the solar system. It has shown an unusual chemical composition, including high levels of carbon dioxide and low levels of water, which is rare among local comets. This suggests that it may have formed in a different environment around another star.</p>

<p>Previous studies of comets within the solar system have demonstrated similar X-ray emissions, but this is the first detailed observation of such phenomena in an interstellar comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are continuing to analyze data from the XMM-Newton telescope to further understand the chemical makeup and behavior of 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>
