      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb Spots 11th Anomaly In Latest Images Of The Interstellar Object</h2>

<p>Professor <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has identified an 11th anomaly in the latest images of the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, taken from the Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma, Canary Islands, on November 11, 2025. The images show no signs of breakup since its perihelion on October 29.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges traditional understanding of comet behavior. Loeb has pointed out that the large-scale jets observed from 3I/ATLAS raise questions about its classification as a natural comet. Authorities in the field are examining these findings to reassess current models of cometary formations and behaviors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of images: November 11, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Nordic Optical Telescope, La Palma, Canary Islands</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Projected position angle: 106 degrees (+/-10)</li>
    <li>Length of jets: Approximately 1 million kilometers sunward and 3 million kilometers in the opposite direction</li>
    <li>Mass flux of jets: 5 billion tons per month</li>
    <li>Energy required for sublimation of CO₂ ice: 3×10<sup>18</sup> Joules</li>
    <li>Absorbing area required: Exceeding 1,600 square kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was observed at its perihelion on October 29, 2025, with subsequent images taken on November 11, 2025. In these images, Loeb noted the prominent elongation in the glow surrounding the object, which aligns closely with the sunward direction. Previous observations from the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025, revealed an anti-tail pointing towards the Sun.</p>
<p>Loeb's analysis of jets extending from 3I/ATLAS has prompted further investigation into the object's structure and behavior, leading to this latest identification of an anomaly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This raises a new anomaly of 3I/ATLAS that must be explained by those who wish to shove the anomalies of 3I/ATLAS under the carpet of traditional knowledge on solar system comets rather than consider alternatives,” said Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, Loeb had documented ten anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, leading to significant discussions within the astrophysics community regarding the nature of interstellar objects. The anomalies challenge existing models of cometary behavior and have sparked debates about the possibility of alternative explanations for their characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the findings from 3I/ATLAS, particularly the implications of the new anomaly. Further observations and discussions within the scientific community are expected as they work to understand the implications of Loeb's claims.</p>
