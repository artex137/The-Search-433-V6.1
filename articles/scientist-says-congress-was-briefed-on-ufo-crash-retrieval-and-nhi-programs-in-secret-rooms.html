      <h2>Scientist Says Congress Was Briefed on UFO Crash Retrieval and NHI Programs in Secret Rooms</h2>

<p>A scientist who has consulted for the Pentagon on UFO programs has claimed he shared significant information about recovered extraterrestrial technology with Congress. Dr. Eric Davis, an astrophysicist, stated he briefed multiple congressional committees in secure locations between October 2019 and May 2021, revealing details about UFO crash retrievals and Non-Human Intelligence (NHI) programs. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This claim highlights a growing awareness among lawmakers regarding the potential implications of UFO phenomena on national security. Despite the briefings, the full extent of the information remains classified, with public disclosure restricted due to national security concerns, according to Davis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dr. Eric Davis briefed congressional committees in secure rooms.</li>
    <li>Briefings occurred in October 2019, June 2021, and May 2023.</li>
    <li>Locations included a Pentagon SCIF, a controlled conference room, and a House SCIF.</li>
    <li>Topics included UFO crash retrieval programs and reverse-engineering efforts.</li>
    <li>Disclosure is limited by Non-Disclosure Agreements protecting national security information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2019, Dr. Davis briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee staff in a Pentagon SCIF. He also presented to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in a controlled conference room that same month. In June 2021, he provided information at a secure access facility of a defense company. Most recently, in May 2023, Davis appeared before Representative Marcos Luna's committee in a House SCIF.</p>

<p>During these briefings, Davis detailed legacy UFO crash retrieval programs and the recovery of off-world vehicles. He emphasized the ongoing research into technology not made on Earth and the potential national security implications of these findings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “What I disclosed to congressional staff represents the most accurate picture of ongoing research in this secretive field,” Davis said.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Full public disclosure is impossible without executive permission,” he added, highlighting the role of the President in waiving Non-Disclosure Agreements.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The U.S. government has historically considered UFO phenomena a matter of national security. Dr. Davis's disclosures indicate a multi-decade effort to catalogue and study technology that could surpass known human capabilities. This ongoing research intersects with the concept of Non-Human Intelligence, suggesting encounters with entities not originating from Earth.</p>

<p>Despite fragmented public hearings, select congressional staff have access to information that could significantly alter our understanding of the universe. The secrecy surrounding these programs aims to preserve strategic advantages and prevent societal disruption.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The future of public disclosure remains uncertain. Investigations into UFO phenomena may continue, but full transparency will depend on executive decisions regarding Non-Disclosure Agreements. The implications of these findings may prompt further scrutiny from lawmakers and the public alike.</p>
