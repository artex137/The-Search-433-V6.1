      <h2>Uk police helicopter ‘targeted’ by fast-moving UFOs over US air base</h2>

<p>On November 22, 2024, a National Police Air Service EC135 helicopter encountered multiple unidentified fast-moving objects while flying over RAF Lakenheath, a US military base in Suffolk, prompting the pilot to take emergency evasive action, according to police logs released under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>This incident raises concerns about aviation safety and the presence of unidentified aerial objects in restricted airspace. Authorities are currently investigating the sightings and have turned the matter over to the UK Ministry of Defence Police, which has not yet released its findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: November 22, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, England</li>
    <li>Aircraft involved: National Police Air Service EC135 helicopter</li>
    <li>Speed of drones: Approximately 165 knots</li>
    <li>Number of drones reported: 2 during the helicopter encounter; 5-6 and 10-15 reported in sightings</li>
    <li>Investigating agency: UK Ministry of Defence Police</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 20, 2024, police logs recorded multiple drone sightings near three US Air Force-operated bases in Suffolk and Norfolk, including RAF Feltwell, RAF Lakenheath, and RAF Mildenhall.</p>
<p>On November 21, a police report noted the presence of 10-15 drones flying around the bases, with some possibly entering restricted airspace.</p>
<p>On November 22, the National Police Air Service EC135 helicopter was forced to perform an emergency dive to avoid collision with two fast-moving objects that appeared to be pursuing it.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They were forced to take emergency evasive action in relation to a drone which came within a dangerously close proximity to them,” an incident log from Suffolk Police stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“In the 30-minute video with pilot audio, nobody mentions F-15s,” a UK military source told the Daily Mail. “They only talk about the drones. How they're basically mirroring the helicopter's movements.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident contradicts a prior explanation from a UK aviation safety board, which attributed the near-collision to pilots misidentifying an American F-15 fighter jet. The released police logs suggest that the situation involved high-tech drones rather than military aircraft.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been increasing reports of unidentified aerial phenomena near military installations, raising questions about airspace security and the need for further investigation into such sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The investigation into the drone sightings and the helicopter incident continues under the UK Ministry of Defence Police, with no timeline for the release of findings disclosed.</p>
