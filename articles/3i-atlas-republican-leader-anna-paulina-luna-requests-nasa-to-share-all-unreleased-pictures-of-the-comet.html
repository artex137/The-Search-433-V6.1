      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Republican Leader Anna Paulina Luna Requests NASA To Share All Unreleased Pictures Of The Comet</h2>

<p>Republican leader Anna Paulina Luna has requested NASA to release all unreleased images of comet 3I/ATLAS, including those captured by the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The request was made on November 3, 2025, amid ongoing interest in the comet, which is the third recorded interstellar visitor in the solar system.</p>

<p>This request highlights the growing curiosity surrounding 3I/ATLAS, particularly after Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb accused NASA of not responding to his earlier request for similar data. Paulina Luna has tagged NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, in her public appeal, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accessibility of scientific information related to interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Request made by Anna Paulina Luna on November 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images from HiRISE camera were captured on October 2-3, 2025.</li>
    <li>HiRISE data has a spatial resolution of approximately 30 kilometers per pixel.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory maintains the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) database.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in Chile by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS-CHL). The comet follows a highly eccentric path and has garnered attention due to its interstellar origins.</p>
<p>On October 2-3, 2025, multiple images of 3I/ATLAS were captured by the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. These images offer a valuable side view of the comet.</p>
<p>On November 3, 2025, Anna Paulina Luna publicly requested that NASA make these images and additional data available to the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I write to request the release of specific observational data related to 3I/ATLAS... This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,” said Anna Paulina Luna in her letter to NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar visitor to be recorded in the solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet was flagged by Dr. Avi Loeb, who noted nine anomalies during his studies, suggesting the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
<p>The request for data from NASA comes at a time when transparency in scientific research is increasingly emphasized, particularly regarding unexplained celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has not yet publicly responded to Luna's request. Further developments are expected as the agency reviews the appeal and considers the release of the requested data.</p>
