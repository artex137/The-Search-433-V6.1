      <h2>Astrometric data suggests interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is anomalously large</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shown no measurable non-gravitational acceleration between May and September 2025, indicating a nucleus mass above <strong>33 billion tons</strong> and a diameter larger than <strong>5 km</strong> (3 miles), according to a study published on September 24 co-authored by Harvard Professor <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it adds a third name to the list of known interstellar objects, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Authorities are now using this data to better understand the characteristics of interstellar objects and their implications for cosmic studies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Study published on September 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Data compiled from May 15 to September 23, 2025.</li>
    <li>Mass loss rate measured at <strong>150 kilograms per second</strong>.</li>
    <li>Outflow velocity observed at <strong>440 m/s</strong>.</li>
    <li>Upcoming observations scheduled for October 3, 2025, and March 16, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Between May 15 and September 23, 2025, astrometric data was collected from 227 observatories worldwide. This data indicated that the object's trajectory aligns with pure gravitational motion.</p>

<p>On August 6, 2025, the Webb Space Telescope provided further observations, revealing a significant mass loss rate. By August 27, the Gemini South telescope detected a faint tail extending from the object, indicating it was shedding material.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, Professor of Science at Harvard University, stated, “Our analysis compared the evolution in the observed sky positions of 3I/ATLAS to the trajectory expected from gravity alone.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two smaller interstellar objects had been recorded, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Models predict that smaller fragments, around 0.1 km (330 feet), should be more common than larger bodies. However, 3I/ATLAS is significantly larger than its predecessors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is scheduled to image 3I/ATLAS on October 3, 2025, which may provide further insights into its size and surface characteristics. Additionally, the Juno spacecraft will pass near the object on March 16, 2026, potentially measuring its brightness and surface activity.</p>
