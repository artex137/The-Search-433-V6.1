      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Makes Its Closest Earth Approach This Week</h2>

<p>This week, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth for its closest flyby, set to occur on December 19, 2025. The comet will pass within approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) of our planet, drawing attention from astronomers and space enthusiasts alike.</p>

<p>Authorities and scientists are preparing for this significant event. With the comet being the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, researchers are eager to study its features and gather insights into the early solar system and the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Visibility: Faint; may require telescopes of 8 inches or larger for observation</li>
    <li>Livestream event: December 18 at 11 p.m. EST (0400 GMT on December 19)</li>
    <li>Livestream host: Astrophysicist Gianluca Masi</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by astronomer Larry Denneau using the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, the comet has gained attention as it approaches Earth.</p>
<p>NASA has confirmed its status as a comet, stating that all evidence indicates it behaves like a comet and originated from beyond our solar system. This confirmation has dispelled various theories, including speculation about its nature as an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “All evidence indicates it behaves like a comet and originated from beyond our solar system,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s Associate Administrator.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object noted to enter our solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The scientific interest surrounding these objects stems from their potential to provide valuable information about the universe and the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet nears its closest approach, astronomers will conduct observations to study its composition and behavior. This flyby presents a unique opportunity for researchers and enthusiasts to engage with the cosmos.</p>
