      <h2>NASA Confirms 3I/ATLAS: Ancient Interstellar Comet, Not Alien Craft</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS, a mysterious object passing through our solar system, is an ancient comet, not an alien spacecraft, following an international investigation. The announcement was made during a livestreamed briefing on <strong>October 30, 2023</strong>, from Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>

<p>This confirmation comes after weeks of speculation fueled by the lack of information during a recent U.S. government shutdown. The comet, which made its closest approach to Mars last month, has sparked global curiosity and theories about its origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: September 2023</li>
    <li>Nearest approach to Earth: Mid-December 2023, approximately <strong>167 million miles (269 million kilometers)</strong> away</li>
    <li>Initial detection: July 2023, by a telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: NASA, European Space Agency</li>
    <li>Instruments used: Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, various ground observatories</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The story of 3I/ATLAS began in <strong>July 2023</strong> when it was first detected by a telescope in Chile. The object, which displayed an unusual trajectory, captured the attention of scientists worldwide. In September, it made its closest approach to Mars, further intensifying interest and speculation about its nature. Following the U.S. government shutdown, NASA resumed communication and confirmed the object's identity as a comet on <strong>October 30, 2023</strong>.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We very much want to find signs of life in the universe,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s Associate Administrator. “But this object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet. And all evidence points to it being a comet.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We were quick to be able to say, ‘Yes, it definitely behaves like a comet,’” said Nicola Fox, head of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “We certainly haven’t seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time an interstellar object has intrigued scientists. In <strong>2017</strong>, the object known as ‘Oumuamua prompted similar speculation about its origins. The response to 3I/ATLAS has been characterized by enhanced scientific collaboration and communication, showcasing advancements in observational technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS will continue its journey through the solar system and is expected to exit back into interstellar space after its approach to Earth in mid-December. Scientists will continue to study the data collected from various instruments to learn more about this ancient comet and its origins.</p>
