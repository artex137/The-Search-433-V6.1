      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-02 16:41 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Shows 16-Hour “Heartbeat”</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected a rhythmic signal from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a 16.16-hour periodic pulse in its brightness. The findings emerged following observations made since its detection in July 2025, as researchers investigate the potential natural or technological origins of this unusual phenomenon.</p>

<p>The discovery has sparked an urgent scientific debate. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has emphasized the importance of understanding whether the observed variability is due to natural cometary activity or indicates something more extraordinary. The light curve of 3I/ATLAS has shown a consistent pattern, raising fundamental questions about the source of the signal.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The periodic pulse in brightness lasts 16.16 hours.</li>
    <li>Amplitude of light variation measured at about 0.3 magnitudes.</li>
    <li>A Hubble Space Telescope photograph taken on July 21 showed a glowing halo of dust and gas.</li>
    <li>The nucleus's effective radius may be as large as 23 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Material from the comet could travel 25,600 kilometers during each cycle.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers first detected comet 3I/ATLAS, leading to ongoing observations. Subsequent findings reported a periodic brightness pulse of 16.16 hours, which has generated significant interest among scientists regarding its origins. On July 21, a Hubble Space Telescope image revealed that most light originates from a surrounding halo rather than the nucleus itself.</p>
<p>Researchers have shifted focus from the nucleus to the coma, where jets of material have been observed. These jets exhibit behavior that may resemble a heartbeat, prompting further investigation into their nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The resulting coma would display periodic variability in its scattering of sunlight.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb emphasized that “none was systematically studied in the published literature,” highlighting the need for more observational evidence.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery follows a trend of increased interest in interstellar objects and their characteristics. Previous observations of comets have typically not shown such pronounced periodicity, making 3I/ATLAS a unique case in astronomical studies.</p>
<p>The debate surrounding the nature of these signals reflects broader questions about the potential for technologically advanced objects in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are calling for coordinated telescopic monitoring to obtain systematic, high-cadence imaging of 3I/ATLAS. This monitoring aims to determine whether the observed jets are influenced by solar illumination or exhibit characteristics inconsistent with known natural mechanisms.</p>
