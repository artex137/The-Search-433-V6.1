      <h2>Radio signals from comet 3I/Atlas confirm cold origin in the Milky Way after ice sublimation</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected radio signals from the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas on October 24, 2025, using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. The signals, captured at frequencies of 1,665 and 1,667 GHz, confirm the comet's natural activity following previous unsuccessful attempts in September. Discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS project in Chile, 3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar visitor to the Solar System, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it enhances understanding of the chemical composition of distant celestial bodies. The observation confirms that the comet's nucleus has undergone sublimation, releasing gases as it approaches the Sun. This process is crucial for studying the formation of worlds beyond the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detection date: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Telescope: MeerKAT, South Africa</li>
    <li>Signal frequencies: 1,665 and 1,667 GHz</li>
    <li>Current speed of 3I/Atlas: about 50 km/s relative to the Sun</li>
    <li>Distance to Earth in December 2025: approximately 270 million km</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached: October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun</li>
    <li>Next planned signal collection: March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS project in Chile. Following this, astronomers made multiple attempts to detect radio signals in September 2025, which were unsuccessful. The successful detection occurred on October 24, 2025, using the MeerKAT radio telescope. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, and emerged from the Sun's glare on October 31, 2025.</p>

<p>Observations on November 10, 2025, showed the comet's rounded, luminous shape and increased brightness as it accelerated. The European Space Agency's Juice mission is set to monitor the comet in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The signals confirm typical cometary activity and reinforce our understanding of interstellar objects,” said a representative from the MeerKAT project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar comet detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique hyperbolic orbit and high speed distinguish it from local comets. Previous studies have shown that interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas provide insights into the chemical makeup of the early solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>A new signal collection is planned for March 2026 as 3I/Atlas approaches Jupiter at a distance of 50 million km. The Juno probe will attempt to record waves between 40 and 50 MHz during this period.</p>
