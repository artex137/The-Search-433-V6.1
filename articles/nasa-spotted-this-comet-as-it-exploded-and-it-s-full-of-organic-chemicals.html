      <h2>NASA Observes Comet 3I/ATLAS Erupting with Organic Chemicals</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed releasing organic chemicals and large debris into space. The comet was caught flaring dramatically by NASA's SPHEREx space telescope following its closest approach to the Sun in December 2025.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected in the solar system. The findings provide scientists with a rare chemical snapshot of material formed around another star. The data collected since its discovery in July 2025 has expanded the understanding of cometary compositions and their implications for the origins of life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx has observed the comet’s activity since August 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the Sun occurred in December 2025.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx is managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</li>
    <li>Organic molecules identified include methanol, cyanide, and methane.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is ejecting relatively large fragments, not just fine dust.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025. NASA's SPHEREx telescope began observing the comet in August 2025, detecting its coma and initial chemical components. The comet reached its closest approach to the Sun in December 2025, where increased solar heating triggered significant activity. Observations in December revealed the comet erupting and releasing a variety of organic materials into space.</p>

<p>Carey Lisse, the lead of the study from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, noted the dramatic increase in brightness recorded two months after perihelion, indicating the time needed for solar heat to reach deeper layers of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Even water ice was quickly sublimating into gas in interplanetary space. Since comets consist of about one-third bulk water ice, it was releasing an abundance of new, carbon-rich material that had remained locked in ice deep below the surface,” said Carey Lisse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Phil Korngut of Caltech explained, “The comet likely developed a radiation-processed crust during its long passage through interstellar space. Once solar energy penetrated that crust, previously shielded ices began releasing what Korngut described as a ‘cocktail of chemicals’ that had not been exposed to space for billions of years.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system. Its discovery and subsequent observations contribute to the understanding of cometary bodies and their chemical compositions. Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects, Oumuamua and Borisov, had been identified.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS through the SPHEREx mission, which aims to gather more data on the comet and its chemical makeup as it travels through the solar system.</p>
