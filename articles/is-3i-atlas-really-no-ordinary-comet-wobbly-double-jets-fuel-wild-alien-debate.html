      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS really no ordinary comet? Wobbly double jets fuel wild alien debate</h2>

<p>Astronomers and space enthusiasts have turned their attention to 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object that has displayed a peculiar double jet structure as it navigates through our solar system. Recent observations have prompted speculation about its nature, with some theorizing it may be an alien probe rather than a typical comet. The object passed Earth earlier this month, but no contact was made.</p>

<p>This debate matters because it has implications for our understanding of interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial technology. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS might be a technologically controlled spacecraft, highlighting the need for scientific scrutiny and further observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object first identified by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>Recent images from the Hubble Space Telescope show a double jet structure.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has indicated that the object may be an artificial alien probe.</li>
    <li>The stronger jet forms an anti-tail directed toward the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed Earth earlier this month without making contact.</li>
    <li>Future observations from telescopes like Keck Observatory and the Very Large Telescope are planned.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, astronomers first observed a sun-facing jet from 3I/ATLAS, which was ten times longer than it was wide. This jet showed a 7-degree wobble in the rotation axis of the object, indicating its origin near the Sun-facing pole.</p>

<p>On December 12 and 27, additional images revealed a weaker jet, which aligned with the stronger sunward jet as the comet departed the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object could be a hostile spacecraft,” Loeb said, cautioning that world leaders should prepare for all potentialities.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest among both UFO enthusiasts and scientists. Named after the ATLAS survey that discovered it, the object has raised questions about the nature of interstellar travel and the characteristics of potential extraterrestrial technology. Loeb has emphasized the need for further investigation to ascertain the true nature of the jets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations are planned using advanced telescopes to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS. Researchers aim to conduct spectroscopic measurements to better understand the jets and the object's composition.
