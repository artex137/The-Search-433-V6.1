      <h2>Anna Paulina Luna wants imagery of passing comet, ‘interstellar visitor’ to solar system</h2>

<p>U.S. Representative <strong>Anna Paulina Luna</strong> has requested additional data and imagery of the comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, which passed approximately 130 million miles from Earth over the weekend. Luna sent her letter to acting NASA Administrator <strong>Sean Duffy</strong> on <strong>October 31</strong>, emphasizing the significance of the comet for understanding interstellar phenomena.</p>

<p>This matter has garnered attention as it may provide insights into possible interactions between interstellar objects and our solar system. Luna has expressed concerns regarding the delay in releasing information, suggesting that the ongoing government shutdown may be hindering scientific progress. She has urged NASA to enhance observations of the comet using its <strong>Juno mission</strong> near Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> passed within 130 million miles of Earth.</li>
    <li>Luna sent her letter to NASA on <strong>October 31</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet may contain ice and is primarily composed of nickel.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed this is the third interstellar comet to enter our solar system.</li>
    <li>Luna has a long-standing interest in unidentified flying objects.</li>
    <li>Sean Duffy stated there is no evidence of alien life associated with the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On <strong>October 31</strong>, Anna Paulina Luna sent a letter to NASA requesting more data on the comet 3I/ATLAS. This request followed the comet's recent passage through the solar system, which has sparked scientific interest due to its potential ice content and nickel composition.</p>

<p>In the days following, Sean Duffy responded to inquiries about the comet, clarifying that NASA's findings do not indicate any alien presence. The comet has been under study by NASA scientists, who are examining its characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,” Luna wrote to Duffy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” Duffy stated on X.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We should not hold science hostage to the shutdown politics of the day,” said Harvard professor <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>, praising Luna’s inquiry.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet's passage has been a topic of discussion within the scientific community, especially regarding its potential implications for understanding interstellar objects. Previous interstellar comets have raised questions about their origins and interactions with our solar system. The ongoing government shutdown has been cited as a factor affecting the timely release of scientific data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to continue its study of the comet, while Luna's call for additional observations may lead to further inquiries into the comet's characteristics. The agency has not disclosed a timeline for the release of additional imagery or data.</p>
