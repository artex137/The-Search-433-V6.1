      <h2>NASA's SPHEREx Mission Captures Detailed View of Interstellar Visitor 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's SPHEREx mission has successfully observed 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object detected within our solar system, providing significant insights into its composition. The observations occurred after 3I/ATLAS emerged from behind the Sun in December 2022, allowing scientists to analyze the object as it traveled through the solar system.</p>

<p>The SPHEREx mission aims to conduct a comprehensive all-sky survey to understand the origins and evolution of the universe. The recent observations of 3I/ATLAS demonstrate the mission's flexibility and advanced capabilities, which can lead to unexpected discoveries in space science.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mission:</strong> SPHEREx (Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer)</li>
    <li><strong>Interstellar Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Period:</strong> December 2022</li>
    <li><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Presence of water vapor, carbon dioxide, dust, and organic molecules</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments:</strong> Triple-mirror telescope observing in 102 infrared wavelengths</li>
    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Insights into the building blocks of life and conditions in other planetary systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in late October 2022 as it emerged from behind the Sun. This marked a critical opportunity for observation due to increased solar heating. SPHEREx captured images of the object's coma, which is formed from gas and dust as 3I/ATLAS approached the Sun.</p>

<p>Following its closest approach, the increased outgassing of 3I/ATLAS provided a chance for further analysis. Observations from SPHEREx and other telescopes have been crucial in understanding the object's internal composition and its system of origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The detection of organic molecules is particularly intriguing, as it suggests that the building blocks for life may be common throughout the galaxy,” said a NASA representative. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS are rare and travel at high speeds on unbound trajectories. Their detection allows scientists to study materials that did not form within our solar system, offering insights into the conditions and materials present in other planetary systems.</p>

<p>Prior observations of interstellar objects have provided valuable data about the formation and distribution of complex organic molecules in the cosmos, aiding in the understanding of the origins of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The SPHEREx mission will continue with its primary objective of surveying the entire sky, aiming to deliver more data that can enhance our understanding of cosmology and galaxy evolution. Ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS will further reveal information about its composition and origins.</p>
