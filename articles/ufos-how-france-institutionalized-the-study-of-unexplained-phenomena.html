      <h2>UFOs: How France Institutionalized the Study of Unexplained Phenomena</h2>

<p>In 1977, the French government established the Group for the Study of Unidentified Aerospace Phenomena (Gepan), now known as Geipan, in response to a surge of reports regarding unidentified flying objects. The organization operates under the French National Center for Space Studies (CNES) and is based in Toulouse.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it marks France's commitment to addressing UFO sightings through a scientific lens rather than through speculation and rumors. Geipan aims to provide a credible discourse on unexplained phenomena while engaging with the public and ensuring transparency in its investigations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Established:</strong> 1977</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Toulouse, France</li>
    <li><strong>Annual reports processed:</strong> Approximately 800</li>
    <li><strong>Categories of reports:</strong> A (explained) to D (unexplained)</li>
    <li><strong>Percentage of unexplained cases:</strong> 3% (down from 20% in the 1980s)</li>
    <li><strong>Notable cases:</strong> Trans-en-Provence (1981), Cussac meeting (1967)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1977, Geipan was created to study UFO phenomena scientifically. It was initially called Gepan and later became Sepra in 1988 before adopting its current name in 2005. The organization has evolved its methodologies over the years, incorporating human sciences to understand witness perceptions better.</p>

<p>Since 2008, Geipan has made its anonymized archives available online, enhancing public transparency. The group has seen a significant decrease in the percentage of unexplained sightings, attributing most cases to rational explanations such as satellites and space debris.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Credible public discourse was needed,” said Frédéric Courtade, director of GEIPAN since 2024.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The establishment of Geipan occurred during a period marked by Cold War tensions, where concerns over military advancements and potential spy activities were prevalent. The organization has since adapted its approach to include a broader understanding of human perception and cognitive biases related to sightings.</p>

<p>Historically, the classification of UFO reports has shifted significantly, with a notable decline in the number of unexplained cases over the decades. This change reflects advancements in technology and understanding of aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Geipan continues to analyze reports and enhance its methodologies to maintain trust with the public while providing clarity on unexplained phenomena. Future efforts may focus on further improving transparency and public engagement regarding UFO sightings.</p>
