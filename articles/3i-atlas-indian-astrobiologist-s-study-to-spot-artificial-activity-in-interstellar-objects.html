      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Indian astrobiologist’s study to spot 'artificial activity' in interstellar objects</h2>

<p>Mumbai: A new research paper by Indian astrobiologist Pushkar Ganesh Vaidya proposes a systematic method to identify signs of artificial activity in the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the inner Solar System. The study, published as a preprint on Zenodo, aims to provide a framework for analysis without claiming that 3I/ATLAS or any other interstellar object is artificial.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it establishes a data-driven approach to assess the nature of interstellar objects. Vaidya, who is the head scientist at the Indian Astrobiology Research Foundation (IARF), emphasizes the need for clear evaluation standards as global observatories prepare for increased detections of such objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua’ in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The research proposes an eight-point operational model for analyzing potential artificial activity.</li>
    <li>The study suggests using existing astronomical and planetary-science instruments for detection.</li>
    <li>The framework is designed to be repeatable, scalable, and adaptable for future interstellar detections.</li>
    <li>The work supports the Interstellar Object Contact Mission (IOCM-1) plan to communicate with potential extraterrestrial civilizations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was identified as an interstellar object as it entered the Solar System, marking it as a point of interest for astronomical research. The paper by Vaidya has been released to advance the understanding of such objects and their potential origins.</p>
<p>The proposed eight-point model includes indicators like trajectory control and environmental perturbations that can be observed with current technology. This framework is anticipated to aid in future studies of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By treating these encounters as scientific opportunities rather than mysteries, we can expand our understanding of both natural and potential artificial processes in space,” said Vaidya. “It’s about asking verifiable questions, not drawing premature conclusions.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study comes amid growing interest in interstellar objects, with advancements in observational technologies. New sky surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), are expected to increase the frequency of interstellar object detections.</p>
<p>Vaidya's work highlights the importance of establishing scientific standards for evaluating these discoveries, as the field of astrobiology continues to evolve.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interstellar object detections become more frequent, researchers will apply Vaidya’s framework to analyze new findings. The Interstellar Object Contact Mission (IOCM-1) is also set to progress, aiming to initiate communication efforts with potential extraterrestrial life.</p>
