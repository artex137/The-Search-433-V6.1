      <h2>China’s Tianwen-1 probe makes unprecedented record of comet 3I/ATLAS coming from deep space on Mars</h2>

<p>The Chinese probe Tianwen-1 has captured unprecedented images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from its orbit around Mars, marking the first time an object from outside the Solar System has been monitored from the Red Planet. The images were released by the National Space Science Center of China and represent a significant achievement in space exploration.</p>

<p>This milestone is important for the global scientific community as it provides crucial data about interstellar objects. The Tianwen-1 mission enhances long-range observation capabilities and contributes to the international effort to study the composition and behavior of rare cosmic visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Approximately 29 million kilometers from Mars</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Estimated at 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Observation date:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> National Space Science Center of China, European Space Agency (ESA), NASA, United Arab Emirates Space Agency</li>
    <li><strong>Mission launch:</strong> July 2020</li>
    <li><strong>Orbital entry:</strong> February 2021</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was initially identified by ground-based observatories in July. Planning for the observation began shortly after this confirmation, involving extensive simulations to predict the comet's exact orbit and low luminosity. The Tianwen-1 probe was launched in July 2020 and entered Mars orbit in February 2021.</p>
<p>The probe's instruments were adapted to capture images of the comet, which included adjustments to the high-resolution HiRIC camera. Engineers conducted rigorous telemetry tests to ensure data integrity during transmission from nearly 30 million kilometers away.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The achievement of the Tianwen-1 mission not only expands long-range observation capabilities, but also enriches the international effort to analyze the composition and behavior of these rare cosmic visitors,” said a representative from the National Space Science Center of China.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation of comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader trend in space exploration, where multiple agencies collaborate to study celestial phenomena. The data collected from the Tianwen-1 mission, combined with contributions from ESA and NASA, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
<p>Previous missions have focused on planetary exploration, but capturing an interstellar comet represents a significant shift in objectives for space agencies worldwide.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The knowledge gained from the observation of 3I/ATLAS will inform future missions, including the planned Tianwen-2 mission, which aims to collect samples from asteroids. This mission is expected to improve space navigation and data collection techniques for deep space exploration.</p>
