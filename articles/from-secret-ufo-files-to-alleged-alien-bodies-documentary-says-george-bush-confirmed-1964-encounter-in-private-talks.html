      <h2>From Secret UFO Files To Alleged Alien Bodies: Documentary Says George Bush Confirmed 1964 Encounter In Private Talks</h2>

<p>A new documentary titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> alleges that former US President George H.W. Bush privately confirmed details of a 1964 alien encounter during discussions with a Pentagon-linked astrophysicist. The film features an interview with Dr. Eric Davis, who served as an advisor to the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP).</p>

<p>This documentary has sparked renewed interest in UFO phenomena and the implications of government secrecy on national security. Authorities are now facing calls to disclose more information regarding UFO incidents, as some lawmakers express concern that undisclosed knowledge may pose risks to national safety.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The documentary claims George H.W. Bush disclosed an alien encounter during private talks in 2003.</li>
  <li>Dr. Eric Davis alleges three alien spacecraft approached a US military base in 1964.</li>
  <li>One craft reportedly landed, and a non-human entity interacted with military personnel.</li>
  <li>The film discusses a purported top-secret government initiative known as the “Legacy Program.”</li>
  <li>Claims of injuries from unidentified anomalous phenomena are detailed by Dr. Gary Nolan.</li>
  <li>Former US lawmakers, including Marco Rubio and Kirsten Gillibrand, appear in the documentary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1964, three alien spacecraft allegedly approached a US military base, with one landing on the tarmac. During private conversations in 2003, George H.W. Bush reportedly recounted this event to Dr. Eric Davis. The documentary presents Davis's claims about the encounter and discusses the “Legacy Program,” which is said to involve the recovery of alien vehicles and bodies.</p>

<p>In 1988, a UFO crash in Russia is also mentioned, where alleged alien remains were recovered. The documentary features various experts, including Davis and quantum physicist Hal Puthoff, discussing the existence of multiple types of extraterrestrials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is naive to assume presidents are fully briefed,” said former Senator Marco Rubio in the documentary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Senator Kirsten Gillibrand emphasized, “Unidentified objects may be advanced technology from adversarial nations like China or Russia.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This documentary comes amid a growing interest in UFOs and government transparency. Previous incidents and reports have raised questions about the extent of government knowledge and the potential implications for national security. The secrecy surrounding these matters has prompted calls for more open investigations and disclosures from authorities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UFO phenomena continues, investigations into past incidents may gain momentum. Lawmakers are expected to push for greater transparency and accountability regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
