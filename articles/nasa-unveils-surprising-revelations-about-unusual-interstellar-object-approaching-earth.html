      <h2>NASA unveils surprising revelations about unusual interstellar object approaching Earth</h2>

<p>On August 28, 2025, NASA has revealed new findings about a mysterious object, known as 3I/ATLAS, which is approaching Earth. The object, the largest interstellar entity ever identified, is estimated to be approximately 7 miles (11.2 kilometres) wide and is travelling at a speed exceeding 41 miles per second. Experts have described it as ‘unnatural,’ raising initial concerns about its potential threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it expands our understanding of interstellar objects. NASA and other organizations have classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet, set to make its closest approach to the Sun around Halloween before heading back into deep space. The James Webb Space Telescope has been instrumental in studying its composition, revealing unusual characteristics that may provide insights into its origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Estimated Size: 7 miles (11.2 kilometres) wide</li>
    <li>Speed: Exceeding 41 miles per second</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to the Sun: Around Halloween 2025</li>
    <li>Composition: 8-to-1 ratio of carbon dioxide to water vapour in coma</li>
    <li>Previous Interstellar Objects: Oumuamua (2017), Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, NASA first identified the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Initial analyses raised concerns about its nature and potential threat. As research progressed, the James Webb Space Telescope began studying the object’s composition, leading to the discovery of its unusual carbon dioxide dominance.</p>

<p>As of August 2025, NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet, despite some speculation from experts like Harvard physicist Avi Loeb regarding its possible origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unique composition of 3I/ATLAS raises intriguing questions about its origins and the processes that shaped it,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While some may speculate about its nature, we classify it as a comet based on our observations,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the identification of previous interstellar objects, Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. These findings have sparked interest and debate within the scientific community about the origins and nature of such objects.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS's unusual composition, particularly the significant presence of carbon dioxide, distinguishes it from typical cometary bodies, which usually have a higher water vapour content.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Further analysis of its composition and trajectory will help scientists better understand interstellar objects and their origins.</p>
