      <h2>Illinois Family Looking for Northern Lights, Sees UFO Instead</h2>

<p>A family in Scales Mound, Illinois, reported seeing an unidentified flying object (UFO) instead of the anticipated Northern Lights on the night of January 19, 2026. They captured video evidence of the strange light, which they described as a pulsating purple orb.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it adds to the growing number of UFO reports in the region, especially during periods of heightened solar activity. The National UFO Reporting Center has noted an uptick in such encounters, prompting interest from both enthusiasts and authorities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: January 19, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: Near Scales Mound, Illinois</li>
    <li>Type of object: Pulsating purple orb</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Family members, including a child</li>
    <li>Reported to: National UFO Reporting Center</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the evening of January 19, 2026, a family went outside in Scales Mound to observe the Northern Lights, which had been visible in the area due to recent solar storms. After a short time, they noticed an unusual light in the northeastern sky.</p>
<p>The family described the object as a purple orb that moved quickly, vanished, and reappeared, all while pulsating and making no sound. They determined that it was not a conventional aircraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“My son and I went out to see if we could see the aurora borealis tonight as we heard it would be visible after dark. After a few moments a purple orb appeared, NE of our home and nothing else was visible in the sky,” the family reported.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It moved very quickly around the sky, would disappear then come back and was pulsating. It was definitely not a plane or a rocket and made no sound,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Recent solar storms have led to increased visibility of the Aurora Borealis in Illinois, drawing attention from local residents. The National UFO Reporting Center has documented a rise in UFO sightings during such astronomical events, indicating a potential correlation between solar activity and public interest in aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and UFO enthusiasts are likely to continue monitoring reports from the public. The family has submitted their video evidence to the National UFO Reporting Center for further investigation.</p>
