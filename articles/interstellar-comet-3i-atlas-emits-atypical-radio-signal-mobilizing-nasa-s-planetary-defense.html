      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS emits atypical radio signal, mobilizing NASA’s planetary defense</h2>

<p>NASA has mobilized its planetary defense team in response to the detection of atypical radio wave emissions from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first identified on July 1, 2025, using the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. The comet, traveling at approximately 100,000 km/h, is the third known interstellar object to enter the Solar System.</p>

<p>This development has drawn significant interest from the global scientific community. The radio signals detected are believed to be natural emissions from the comet, prompting experts to intensify monitoring and analysis to understand its unique characteristics and behavior. Scientists from various institutions, including the European Space Agency (ESA) and the University of Hawaii, are involved in this extensive research effort.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet travels at approximately 100,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Minimum approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Radio signal detected on October 24, 2025, at a frequency of 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>Comet's nucleus estimated between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) mobilized in August 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The ATLAS system detected 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025, initiating scientific interest in the comet's characteristics. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa recorded a radio signal from the comet, which added urgency to its monitoring. Following the detection, NASA's PDCO convened experts in August 2025 to assess the comet's behavior and establish a response protocol.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches Earth, advanced telescopes, including the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), have been scheduled for detailed analysis of the comet's chemical spectrum.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The activity of 3I/ATLAS is natural to the comet, ruling out external interference or artificial origins,” said a NASA spokesperson.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Continuous monitoring of the 3I/ATLAS trajectory ensures that any unexpected deviations would be promptly identified,” stated a representative from ESA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as a fragment ejected from another star system millions of years ago. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicates it will not return to the Solar System after its current passage, making this an exceptional opportunity for scientific study. Previous interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, exhibited different behaviors, highlighting the unique nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research teams will continue to analyze the radio signals and monitor the comet's trajectory as it approaches Earth. Detailed studies aim to enhance understanding of the chemical composition and behavior of interstellar objects, contributing to broader knowledge about planetary system formation.</p>
