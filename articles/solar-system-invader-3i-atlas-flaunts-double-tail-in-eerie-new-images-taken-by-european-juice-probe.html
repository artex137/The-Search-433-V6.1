      <h2>Solar System Invader 3I/ATLAS Flaunts Double Tail In Eerie New Images Taken By European Juice Probe</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through the solar system. The images reveal a striking double tail trailing behind the comet as it approaches its closest pass to Earth on December 19, 2023. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this cosmic event.</p>

<p>This comet is significant because it is the third interstellar object observed in our solar system. The European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice). These efforts aim to gather insights into the comet's composition and trajectory, providing valuable information about celestial bodies that originate outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass within 270 million kilometres (167 million miles) of Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Hubble captured images of the comet on November 30, 2023, from 178 million miles (286 million kilometres) away.</li>
    <li>Juice observed the comet in early November from 41 million miles (66 million kilometres) away.</li>
    <li>Most data from the Juice flyby will reach Earth between February 18 and 20, 2024.</li>
    <li>Juice was launched in April 2023 and is scheduled to arrive at Jupiter in July 2031.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023, prompting a global effort to study the object before it exits the solar system. Initial observations by Hubble provided detailed images of the comet's shape. On November 30, Hubble conducted another imaging session, revealing clearer details of the comet from a distance of 178 million miles (286 million kilometres).</p>

<p>In early November, the ESA's Juice mission, while on its way to study Jupiter, captured images of 3I/ATLAS from approximately 41 million miles (66 million kilometres) away. This observation revealed significant activity on the comet's surface due to solar heating.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches its closest pass to Earth on December 19, scientists continue to analyze the data collected from both Hubble and Juice.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This early glimpse has proven scientifically significant, revealing heat-driven activity on the comet resulting from its solar encounter,” said a member of the Juice mission team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected in our solar system. Its discovery has spurred interest in studying objects that originate from outside our solar neighborhood. The ongoing observations aim to enhance our understanding of such rare celestial visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are awaiting further data from the Juice mission, expected to arrive between February 18 and 20, 2024. This data will include high-resolution images that may provide additional insights into the comet's origins and characteristics.</p>
