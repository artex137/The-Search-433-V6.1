      <h2>New images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveal twin tails ahead of December flyby</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have been captured by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (Juice), revealing its twin tails as it approaches Earth for a close flyby on December 19th. The comet was observed from distances of 178 million and 41 million miles from Earth, respectively.</p>

<p>The observations are critical for scientists looking to study the gases and space dust associated with 3I/ATLAS to better understand planetary system formation. The comet, which exhibits a streamlined shape and electric azure hue, has a plasma tail and a dust tail, characteristics that provide insight into its behavior and origin. The images come just before the comet's trajectory will take it behind the Sun from Earth's perspective.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19th.</li>
    <li>Hubble and Juice have captured images from distances of 178 million and 41 million miles.</li>
    <li>The comet has a plasma tail made of electrically-charged gas and a dust tail of solid particles.</li>
    <li>Juice will send back high-resolution images from February 18th to 20th.</li>
    <li>This is a rare opportunity to study a comet from outside our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Hubble and Juice have observed 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. The comet's visibility will peak on December 19th, after which it will move behind the Sun from Earth's vantage point. Juice will provide additional images and data in February 2024, offering more insights into the comet's chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is one of the only chances in human history to observe these kinds of images directly,” said a spokesperson from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its interstellar origin, behaving similarly to comets from our solar system. Previous discussions have suggested that the comet could potentially be a UAP, with claims from Harvard's Arvi Loeb indicating a 30-40% chance of this possibility. However, no evidence has substantiated these claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As December 19th approaches, scientists and astronomers will closely monitor 3I/ATLAS, preparing for its peak visibility. Further analysis will follow the high-resolution images sent by Juice in February, which may enhance understanding of the comet's origins and composition.</p>
