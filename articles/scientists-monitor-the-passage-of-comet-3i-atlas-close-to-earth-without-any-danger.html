      <h2>Scientists monitor the passage of comet 3I/Atlas close to Earth without any danger</h2>

<p>On Friday, December 19, 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas reached its closest proximity to Earth, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers. Experts from NASA and several international observatories have confirmed that there is no risk or threat to the planet or its inhabitants.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study a celestial object originating from outside the Solar System. Authorities have mobilized a global network of telescopes to monitor the comet continuously, ensuring that any potential impacts are assessed accurately.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Minimum distance from Earth: 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Core size: Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed: Greater than 200,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): October 29, 2025, at 1.36 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Expected passage near Jupiter: 2026</li>
    <li>Monitoring agencies: NASA, ESA, and a network of global observatories</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile. It entered the Solar System from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. Its closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 29, 2025, marking the beginning of its most active phase. The comet is expected to continue its journey towards the outer regions of the Solar System before heading back to interstellar space.</p>

<p>Observations have revealed that the comet exhibits a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its origin from another star system. This trajectory is distinct from elliptical comets that regularly orbit the Sun. The comet has been actively monitored by a global network of telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the Gemini North telescope.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no perceptible risk or threat to the planet or terrestrial life,” said experts from NASA and international observatories, dispelling rumors circulating on digital platforms.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third object confirmed to originate from outside the Solar System, following the previous interstellar comets ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Both of these comets passed through the Solar System without causing any observable changes on Earth.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/Atlas is particularly important as it may contain primordial material dating back billions of years, providing insights into the formation of star systems in the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it travels towards the outer Solar System. Observations will focus on its composition and behavior, with further data expected to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
