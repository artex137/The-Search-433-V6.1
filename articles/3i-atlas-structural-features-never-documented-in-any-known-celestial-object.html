      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Structural Features Never Documented In Any Known Celestial Object</h2>

<p>On November 22, 2025, amateur astronomer Efraín Morales Rivera captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, revealing unprecedented structural features that challenge existing theories of cometary physics. The object, discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025, is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>The findings from Rivera's images have prompted intensive international scrutiny, as scientists investigate the implications of 3I/ATLAS's unique morphology and behaviour. Authorities have activated U.S. planetary defence co-ordination protocols, although they have confirmed that the comet poses no collision threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Imaging Date: November 22, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (approximately 270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Perihelion Passage: October 29, 2025, at 1.36 AU from the Sun</li>
    <li>Nearby Venus: November 3, 2025, within 97 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Upcoming Close Approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026, at 53.4 million kilometres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. The comet passed perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 AU from the Sun. On November 3, it approached Venus within 97 million kilometres. Efraín Morales Rivera captured significant images of the comet on November 22, 2025, which revealed its unique structural features.</p>
<p>Following these observations, U.S. planetary defence protocols were activated, although officials confirmed the comet does not pose a threat to Earth. The next significant event will be its close approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The scientific implications of an object that appears to violate established models of cometary structure and behaviour are profound,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects. Previous visitors, such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have already raised questions about the nature of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. The anomalies observed in 3I/ATLAS, particularly its lack of a dust tail and its unusual gas emissions, further complicate existing models of cometary behaviour.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026, seeking to understand its unique properties and the implications for our understanding of comets. Further observations and analyses are expected to provide more insight into this unprecedented celestial object.</p>
