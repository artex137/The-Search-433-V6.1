      <h2>3I/ATLAS Visible from Earth: Are We on the Brink of a Cosmic Revelation?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is now visible from Earth, according to a report by the New York Post. Astronomer Qicheng Zhang has confirmed that the comet can be viewed with small telescopes, marking a significant phase in its journey across the universe.</p>

<p>This visibility is important for both amateur and professional astronomers, as it allows for closer observation of the comet. Zhang noted that the comet's visibility is enhanced because it is rising early during morning twilight. Authorities are encouraging those interested to use telescopes to observe this celestial event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently visible with small telescopes.</li>
    <li>Visibility began at the start of the month.</li>
    <li>Qicheng Zhang is the astronomer who photographed the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet appears as a "fuzzy dot" in images.</li>
    <li>Optimal viewing conditions include a clear sky and a low eastern horizon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the month, Qicheng Zhang took a photograph of comet 3I/ATLAS, confirming its visibility through small telescopes. Zhang indicated that the comet is becoming increasingly visible as it rises during morning twilight.</p>

<p>As observers look to the skies, Zhang has emphasized that while the comet may not appear impressive at first, it will become a more noticeable feature in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is easily visible with small telescopes now,” said Qicheng Zhang to the New York Post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“All you need is a clear sky and a very low eastern horizon…It won’t look impressive, it’s just a smudge, but it will be an increasingly visible smudge over the next few days,” Zhang added in an article by Live Science.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous comets have captured public interest due to their rare appearances and the scientific insights they provide. Comet 3I/ATLAS's visibility has prompted discussions among astronomers and enthusiasts, highlighting the importance of celestial events in understanding our universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, observers are encouraged to monitor its visibility in the coming days. No further details regarding its trajectory or potential impact have been disclosed.</p>
