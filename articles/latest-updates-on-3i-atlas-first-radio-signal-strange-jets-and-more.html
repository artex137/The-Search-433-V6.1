      <h2>Latest updates on 3I/ATLAS: First radio signal, strange jets and more</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed several mysterious features since emerging from the Sun's glare, with significant developments including the detection of its first radio signal and observations of strange jets. The comet became visible in the morning sky after reaching perihelion on October 29-30, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the comet's behavior and characteristics after billions of years in space. Astronomers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS, which has shown changes due to space radiation, while ground-based and space telescopes continue to capture images of its evolving tail.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29-30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The MeerKAT radio telescope detected the first radio signal on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images show a growing tail and multiple jets extending up to half a million kilometres.</li>
    <li>At least seven distinct jets have been observed, including anti-tails directed toward the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023. The comet reached perihelion on October 29-30, 2025, and the first radio signal was detected by the MeerKAT radio telescope on October 24, 2025. This discovery was announced on November 8, 2025, revealing the presence of hydroxyl radicals in the comet's emissions.</p>
<p>As astronomers continued to observe 3I/ATLAS, they noted the growth of its tail and the appearance of multiple jets. The comet's features have sparked intrigue among scientists, who are studying its behavior and changes as it travels through space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor, noted, "3I/ATLAS displays a large glowing halo extending out to half a million kilometres, with at least seven distinct jets." </blockquote>
<blockquote>Researchers from Belgium and the USA stated that 3I/ATLAS is now a "battered and bruised version of itself" after billions of years in space.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations of comets have shown similar behaviors, but the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have raised questions among scientists. The discovery of the radio signal adds a new dimension to our understanding of interstellar objects. The comet's changes due to space radiation highlight the effects of a long journey through the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Further studies are planned to analyze its jets and emissions, and researchers will investigate the implications of the detected radio signals.</p>
