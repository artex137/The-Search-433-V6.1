      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Avi Loeb Decodes Exocomet’s Hubble Images Captured During Its Rare Full Moon Phase</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has analyzed six images of the interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, captured by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope during its rare “full moon phase” on January 22 or 23, 2026. The images reveal a brightness surge as the comet aligned with the Sun-Earth axis. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it provides new insights into the structure and behavior of 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object identified in the solar system. NASA’s Hubble captured the images during a time of heightened brightness, revealing complex features of the comet’s halo and jet system. The findings may have implications for understanding the nature of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: January 22 or 23, 2026</li>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Images Captured: Six by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope</li>
    <li>Brightness Surge: Observed during full moon phase</li>
    <li>Jet System: Includes four jets, with one prominent anti-tail</li>
    <li>Mini-jets: Three, separated by 120 degrees</li>
    <li>Wobble Period: Every 7.2 hours by +/- 20 degrees</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered a full moon phase on January 22 or 23, 2026, aligning with the Sun-Earth axis. During this time, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope captured six images of the comet, revealing significant details about its structure.</p>
<p>Loeb and his collaborator, Toni Scarmato, processed the images using the Larson-Sekanina Rotational Gradient filter. The analysis showed a glowing halo around the comet, elongated in the direction of the Sun, and a system of jets, including an anti-tail and three mini-jets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We still do not know the nature of the anti-tail that allows it to penetrate hundreds of thousands of kilometers through the Solar wind and radiation without being deflected away from the Sun,” said Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered in our solar system, following <strong>1I/Oumuamua</strong> in 2017 and <strong>2I/Borisov</strong> in 2019. Each of these objects has provided unique insights into the composition and dynamics of interstellar bodies.</p>
<p>The presence of jets and anti-tails in comets is not uncommon, but the features observed in 3I/ATLAS raise questions about their formation and behavior in the context of interstellar travel.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further research is planned to investigate the nature of the anti-tail and the mini-jets of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb has proposed several hypotheses regarding their composition, which may guide future studies.</p>
