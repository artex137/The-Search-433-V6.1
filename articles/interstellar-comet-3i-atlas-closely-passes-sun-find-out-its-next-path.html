      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Closely Passes Sun; Find Out Its Next Path</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS has recently completed its closest pass by the Sun, approximately 126 million miles (203 million kilometers) away. The comet will remain observable from Earth for several more months, with predictions that it will become visible again starting November 11, 2023, in the predawn sky.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency reported that 3I/ATLAS is on a trajectory out of our solar system. It is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023, at around 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) distant. Authorities have confirmed there is no risk posed to our planet by this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: 126 million miles (203 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Next visibility from Earth: November 11, 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023, at 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Age estimate: Between 3 billion and 11 billion years old</li>
    <li>Recent approach to Mars: Within 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Brightness: 10,000 to 100,000 times dimmer than Mars</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023. In October, the comet made a close approach to Mars, coming within approximately 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) of the planet. During this time, the ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured images of the comet.</p>

<p>On November 11, 2023, astronomers expect the comet to become visible again to observers on Earth. It will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023, at around 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) distant.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no risk posed to our planet by this interstellar object,” according to the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third interstellar object recorded to pass through our solar system. The comet provides a unique opportunity to study materials that are fundamentally different from those typically found in our solar system’s comets. The estimated age of the comet, between 3 billion and 11 billion years, offers insight into materials from its formation, in contrast to the solar system's estimated age of 4.6 billion years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations of 3I/ATLAS are planned by ESA’s Juice spacecraft, which may gather more data on the comet as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>
