      <h2>3I/ATLAS Is Pulsing Every 16.16 Hours: What Does This Mean For Callisto?</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected a heartbeat-like pulse from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which brightens and dims every 16.16 hours. This phenomenon has intrigued researchers and sparked speculation about its effects on Jupiter's moon Callisto. However, NASA has stated that the flicker is purely optical and poses no threat to Jupiter, its moons, or the wider Solar System.</p>

<p>The object, first detected on 1 July 2023 by the ATLAS sky-survey project, has been observed to exhibit this rhythmic brightness change. Scientists emphasize that the changes are due to reflected sunlight and not a change in the object's mass, orbit, or energy output. The brightening and dimming are common among comets, but recent analysis suggests that rotation alone may not explain the observed effects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Detection date: 1 July 2023</li>
    <li>Pulsation period: 16.16 hours</li>
    <li>Nucleus size estimate: up to 2.8 km in radius</li>
    <li>Observation method: Hubble Space Telescope</li>
    <li>Current status: No threat to Jupiter or its moons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>1 July 2023: 3I/ATLAS is first detected by the ATLAS sky-survey project.</p>
<p>21 July 2023: NASA publishes Hubble Space Telescope observations indicating that most light from 3I/ATLAS comes from its coma, not its solid nucleus.</p>
<p>Current: Researchers investigate the possibility of periodic jets of gas and dust causing the brightness changes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The pulsing does not affect Jupiter or its moon Callisto in any way. It is purely a light phenomenon, not a change in size, mass or trajectory,” NASA stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The simplest explanation is still the most likely,” said comet specialists regarding the observed brightness changes.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed, providing a unique opportunity to study the chemistry and behavior of bodies formed around distant stars. Researchers have noted that such 'outgassing' behavior is typical among comets and can produce strong, periodic brightness changes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers are seeking more continuous, long-duration observations, essentially 'time-lapse' sequences, to confirm if the brightening events correspond to specific regions rotating into sunlight. These observations may strengthen the jet-driven explanation for the brightness pulses.</p>
