      <h2>A new ‘Great Comet’ may be visible in broad daylight – here’s when to see it</h2>

<p>A newly discovered comet, C/2026 A1 (MAPS), is expected to make a close approach to the Sun in early April 2026. Astronomers discovered the comet on January 13, 2023, in the Atacama Desert, and it has generated excitement due to its potential brightness and visibility, even in daylight.</p>

<p>The significance of this discovery lies in the comet's classification as a member of the Kreutz sungrazing family, known for producing some of the most spectacular comets in history. Authorities, including NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, are monitoring the comet's trajectory and brightness as it nears the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> C/2026 A1 (MAPS)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> January 13, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Location:</strong> Atacama Desert</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> 120,000 km</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Visibility:</strong> Early to mid-April 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Potential Brightness:</strong> Could be visible in broad daylight</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 13, 2023, a team of four amateur astronomers identified comet C/2026 A1 (MAPS) using a remotely operated telescope in the Atacama Desert. Following its discovery, astronomers recognized it as part of the Kreutz sungrazing group.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches the Sun in early April 2026, it will pass within 120,000 km of the Sun's surface. Observations have indicated that the comet has been steadily brightening, suggesting it may be a larger fragment of a comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If the comet survives its closest approach to the Sun, it could put on a great show in early to mid-April,” said Professor Jonti Horner, an astrophysicist at the University of Southern Queensland.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Kreutz sungrazing comets have a history of producing bright and visible comets in the sky. Notable examples include the Great Comet of 1965 and the Great Comet of 1882, both of which were visible in daylight. The current trajectory of C/2026 A1 (MAPS) aligns with the historical patterns of these remarkable comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As astronomers continue to monitor C/2026 A1 (MAPS), they will assess its brightness and stability as it approaches perihelion. The potential for a dazzling display in the evening sky, or even in daylight, remains contingent on the comet's ability to withstand the intense heat of the Sun.</p>
