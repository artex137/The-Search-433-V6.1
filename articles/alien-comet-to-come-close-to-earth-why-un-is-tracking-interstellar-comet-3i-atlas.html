      <h2>Alien comet to come close to Earth: Why UN is tracking interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), under the guidance of the United Nations, has initiated a global campaign to track interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest distance to Earth on December 19, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>This campaign is significant as it aims to enhance the precision of comet detection and astrometry, which is critical for identifying near-Earth objects. NASA is supporting this effort, which involves more than 80 observatories worldwide. Authorities have emphasized that there is no immediate risk of collision, and the campaign serves as a strategic exercise to strengthen planetary defense methodologies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Observatories Involved:</strong> Over 80 worldwide</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign Start:</strong> October 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Observation:</strong> Late June 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Participant Count:</strong> 171 in the opening session, 100 active contributors by December 9, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in late June 2025. It was incorporated into the IAWN observing schedule in October 2024, coinciding with the finalization of campaign plans. As the comet continues its approach, it has prompted a series of workshops and virtual meetings organized by IAWN to improve observation techniques.</p>

<p>By December 9, 2025, the campaign reported a strong level of engagement, with 100 contributors actively involved in tracking the comet. This collaborative effort has fostered improved technical capacity and coordination among global observatories.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The primary aim of the project is to tackle the obstacles in accurately determining comet positions,” said a spokesperson for IAWN.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Insights gained through ongoing observations of comet 3I/ATLAS are anticipated to inform improved protocols for future monitoring of similar interstellar objects,” the spokesperson added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its interstellar origins but also for its adherence to typical comet behavior, displaying water vapour and carbon dioxide as it approaches the Sun. This phenomenon allows astronomers to evaluate established detection methods effectively.</p>

<p>Previous efforts to track comets have faced challenges, particularly with the variability in the coma—the cloud of gas and dust surrounding the comet—that complicates astrometric calculations and the prediction of orbital paths.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN campaign will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with ongoing observations expected to enhance future protocols for tracking interstellar objects.</p>
