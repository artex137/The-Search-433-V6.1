      <h2>Lauren Boebert vows to pursue ‘truth about UFOs’ as she bids for re-election</h2>

<p>Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert has launched her campaign for a fourth term in the U.S. House, promising to pursue “the truth about UFOs,” according to an email from her re-election campaign sent to potential donors. The announcement comes as Boebert aims to retain her seat during the November 2026 midterms.</p>

<p>This campaign pledge highlights Boebert's focus on unidentified flying objects, also known as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), amid ongoing discussions about government transparency. Boebert's campaign claims that the public deserves clear answers about UFOs, which she asserts have been shrouded in secrecy by government officials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Boebert's re-election campaign announcement was sent via email to potential donors.</li>
    <li>The midterm elections are scheduled for November 2026.</li>
    <li>Boebert won her second term in Congress in 2022 by a margin of 546 votes.</li>
    <li>She moved to a more conservative district for the 2024 election.</li>
    <li>Boebert's focus on UFOs has included previous statements made during congressional hearings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 13 November 2024, Boebert participated in a congressional hearing on UAPs, where she inquired about the possibility of underwater alien bases. Her questioning indicated a longstanding interest in UFOs.</p>
<p>In 2022, she secured her second term in Congress by defeating Adam Frisch. To avoid a rematch with Frisch, Boebert relocated to a more solidly conservative district, winning her third term in 2024 against Trisha Calvarese.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For decades, our government has shrouded the truth about UFOs in a veil of secrecy,” Boebert's campaign message stated. “I SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! The American people aren’t children to be spoon-fed half-truths or dismissed with vague excuses.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Democratic political analyst Andy Boian described Boebert's campaign message as “almost a cry for help,” suggesting she may be struggling to gain support.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Boebert's focus on UFOs is not new, as she has previously expressed interest in alien phenomena during congressional hearings. Her comments often reflect a broader trend among some politicians to engage with conspiracy theories and unverified claims.</p>
<p>In the political landscape, unusual campaign messages can signal desperation for funding or voter support, particularly as candidates approach critical election periods.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Boebert’s campaign is expected to continue emphasizing her commitment to uncovering information about UFOs as the midterm elections approach. Further developments may arise as she seeks to engage with prospective voters and donors.</p>
