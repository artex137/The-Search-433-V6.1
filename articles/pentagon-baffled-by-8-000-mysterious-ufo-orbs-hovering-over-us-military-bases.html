      <h2>Pentagon baffled by 8,000 mysterious UFO orbs hovering over US military bases</h2>

<p>The Pentagon is investigating over 8,000 sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), specifically small metallic orbs, reported across the United States from December 2022 to June 2025. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has received 422 reports of these orbs, primarily observed between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. near military installations in New York, California, and Arizona. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to these sightings.</p>

<p>This situation is significant as it raises national security concerns. Military officials are eager to understand the nature of these orbs, which have been observed moving at high speeds and hovering silently. The AARO has dismissed many sightings as natural phenomena but acknowledges that several cases remain unexplained due to insufficient data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>More than 8,000 UFO sightings reported from December 2022 to June 2025.</li>
    <li>422 reports specifically describe metallic orbs.</li>
    <li>Majority of sightings occur between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m.</li>
    <li>Notable locations include military bases in New York, California, and Arizona.</li>
    <li>21 of 757 UFO cases released by AARO between May 2023 and June 2024 remain unresolved.</li>
    <li>Witnesses include civilians, pilots, and military personnel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2024, a witness reported seeing two metallic objects hovering over Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn. This sighting followed various reports from military personnel and civilians of orbs appearing near military installations.</p>

<p>From December 2022 to June 2025, the crowdsourced platform Enigma documented over 8,000 sightings of UFOs, with a focus on 422 metallic orb reports. The Pentagon's AARO has been actively investigating these claims, aiming to clarify the nature of the sightings.</p>

<p>In 2022, military drone footage captured a metal sphere flying in broad daylight in the Middle East, further complicating the investigation into these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If these videos don't prove that aliens exist, then they're evidence that a rival foreign power could be doing stuff in our backyard,” said Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, former director of AARO.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Strange orb sightings have been reported worldwide, including incidents from Puerto Rico and Europe during World War II. The Pentagon and civilian organizations, such as the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), have been cataloging these occurrences for decades. Recent theories suggest that these orbs could be surveillance devices from foreign powers, given their agility and ability to evade radar.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO continues to investigate these sightings. Officials are focusing on gathering more data to understand the nature and origin of these mysterious orbs. Further analysis of the Buga Sphere, a metallic object recovered in Colombia, is also underway.</p>
