      <h2>The UFO story most Nova Scotians DON’T know</h2>

<p>On the night of October 12, 1960, an unidentified flying object reportedly appeared over Shelburne, Nova Scotia, according to UFOlogist Chris Styles. Styles has dedicated decades to uncovering details about this incident, which has faded from public memory despite the significant evidence he claims to have found. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to the event.</p>

<p>The incident is notable because it highlights a lesser-known chapter in Nova Scotia's history of UFO sightings. Styles has emphasized the importance of bringing this story to light, particularly since it involves firsthand accounts that have remained undisclosed for over 60 years. Authorities have not initiated any formal investigations into this incident, as it has not been widely recognized.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: October 12, 1960</li>
    <li>Location: Shelburne, Nova Scotia</li>
    <li>Researcher: Chris Styles</li>
    <li>Involvement: Eyewitness account from a person close to Styles</li>
    <li>Status: No formal investigation initiated</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 12, 1960, an object was reported in the skies over Shelburne. Chris Styles has spent decades researching this incident and claims to have uncovered significant evidence that supports the occurrence of a UFO sighting. He has also revealed that someone close to him witnessed the event firsthand.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I have uncovered irrefutable evidence that something monumental occurred in the Shelburne harbour that night,” said Chris Styles.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Styles continues to advocate for the recognition of the Shelburne UFO incident and aims to share more information as he uncovers it. No formal steps have been announced by any authorities regarding an investigation into this historical event.</p>
