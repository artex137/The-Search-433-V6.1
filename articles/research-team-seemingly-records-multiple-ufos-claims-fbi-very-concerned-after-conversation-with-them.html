      <h2>Research Team Captures Footage of Multiple UFOs in New York</h2>

<p>Nightcrawler Research, a data-focused UFO investigation team, has reported capturing footage of three unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in New York. The sightings occurred on July 5 and involved objects that disrupted camera performance during recording, according to team member John Tedesco.</p>

<p>The FBI and other federal agencies have taken notice of the team's efforts. Tedesco stated in a recent interview that the FBI is "very concerned" about the reported sightings. This development underscores the ongoing interest and scrutiny surrounding UFO phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
