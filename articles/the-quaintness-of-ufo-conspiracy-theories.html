      <h2>The quaintness of UFO conspiracy theories</h2>

<p>Former US president Barack Obama has expressed his belief that aliens might exist, although he has not personally seen them. He made these comments during a podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen last week. Obama stated that there are no aliens being housed in Area 51, a classified US Air Force base, and emphasized, “There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president.” In response to Obama’s remarks, former president Donald Trump has not taken a definitive stance on the existence of extraterrestrial life but has reportedly expressed frustration over the disclosure of what he considers ‘classified information’. To address concerns regarding UFOs, Trump announced that the State Department will begin the process of identifying and releasing government files related to aliens and extraterrestrial life.</p>
