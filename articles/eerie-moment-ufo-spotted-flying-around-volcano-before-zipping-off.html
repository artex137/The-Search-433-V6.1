      <h2>Eerie moment 'UFO' spotted flying around volcano before zipping off</h2>

<p>Footage has emerged of a suspected UFO hovering over the Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico on Thursday, as the glowing object was seen floating above the crater before suddenly disappearing at high speeds. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the sighting.</p>

<p>The sighting has captured the attention of UFO enthusiasts and local authorities have yet to comment on the origin of the object. The National Center for Disaster Prevention noted that the volcano had experienced multiple low-intensity eruptions on the same day, prompting warnings for the public to maintain a safe distance from the area.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on Thursday, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Location: Popocatepetl volcano, Puebla and Morelos, Mexico.</li>
    <li>Altitude of Popocatepetl: 5,426 metres (17,802 feet).</li>
    <li>19 low-intensity eruptions reported on the day of the sighting.</li>
    <li>12-kilometre exclusion zone established around the crater.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday, a webcam captured footage of a glowing object hovering over the Popocatepetl crater. The volcano is known for its frequent activity, and on the same day, the National Center for Disaster Prevention reported 19 low-intensity eruptions. The object was seen monitoring the crater before it rapidly ascended and disappeared.</p>

<p>Earlier, UFO expert Jaime Maussan suggested that Popocatepetl acts as an "inter-dimensional portal," implying that the volcano could allow for intergalactic travel. His claims stemmed from studies indicating the presence of magnetic storms beneath the volcano.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The University of Bergen in Norway discovered that under the volcano there are magnetic storms necessary to be able to generate X-points - or regions of electron diffusion - and be used to create a Dimensional Portal,” Jaime Maussan said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a recent crash of an unidentified aircraft near Area 51, which has sparked speculation among UFO enthusiasts. The crash on September 23 led to a military investigation and the establishment of a temporary flight restriction in the area.</p>

<p>Last year, Maussan claimed that no man-made object could withstand the extreme temperatures of a volcano, which can reach around 1,000 degrees Celsius.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any further investigations regarding the UFO sighting. The National Center for Disaster Prevention continues to monitor the volcanic activity and has urged the public to respect the exclusion zone.</p>
