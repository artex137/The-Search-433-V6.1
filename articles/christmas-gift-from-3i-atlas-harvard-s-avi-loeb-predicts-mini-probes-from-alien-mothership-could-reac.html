      <h2>Christmas gift from 3I/ATLAS? Harvard’s Avi Loeb predicts ‘mini-probes’ from ‘alien mothership’ could reach Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has reached its perihelion today, October 29, 2025, at approximately 11:47 Universal Time (UT), passing 1.36 Astronomical Units (AU) or about 203 million kilometers from the Sun. The object is currently positioned almost directly opposite Earth and will not be visible again until early December 2025, according to NASA.</p>

<p>This celestial event has garnered global attention due to speculation from Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who suggests that 3I/ATLAS could release “mini probes” before Christmas. Loeb has drawn interest with his claims about the object’s potential technological nature, prompting scientists to monitor its behavior closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at 11:47 UT.</li>
    <li>The object is currently 203 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Nasa predicts it will reappear from behind the Sun by early December 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2025, at 267 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Loeb’s research team is monitoring for unusual activity in the coming months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>October 29, 2025: 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion, the closest point to the Sun.</p>
<p>November 3, 2025: The object will pass 97 million kilometers from Venus, potentially observable by the European Space Agency’s Juice mission.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: 3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth at 267 million kilometers.</p>
<p>March 16, 2026: The object will approach 54 million kilometers from Jupiter, where NASA’s Juno spacecraft may attempt imaging and radio scans.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Will 3I/ATLAS send mini-probes towards Earth as Christmas gifts to humanity?” Loeb speculated in his essay titled “The Acid Test of 3I/ATLAS at Perihelion.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Perihelion constitutes the acid test of 3I/ATLAS… We will know the nature of 3I/ATLAS better in the coming months,” Loeb concluded.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Its unusual motion and composition have led to speculation that it may be something other than a natural comet. Scientists are closely observing the object for clues about its origin and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the Solar System, scientists will monitor its behavior closely, especially during its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Further observations will help determine the nature of the object and any potential technological signatures it may exhibit.</p>
