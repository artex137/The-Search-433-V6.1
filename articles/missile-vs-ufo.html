      <h2>Missile vs. UFO: U.S. Drone Fires at Unidentified Object</h2>

<p>A U.S. drone has fired a Hellfire missile at a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen, according to a video released by Congress. The missile reportedly bounced off the unidentified object, which has raised questions among military experts. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the incident.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights ongoing concerns regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and the military's engagement with such objects. Authorities are now reviewing the circumstances surrounding the incident and assessing the implications for national security and defense protocols.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred off the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>A U.S. drone fired a Hellfire missile at a glowing orb.</li>
    <li>The missile bounced off the object, according to the video evidence.</li>

    <li>Congress has released the video of the incident.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, Congress has released footage showing a U.S. drone engaging an unidentified flying object off the coast of Yemen. The drone fired a Hellfire missile at the object, which did not result in a successful strike as the missile bounced off. This incident has prompted discussions among veterans and military experts regarding the nature of UAPs.</p>

<p>Veterans have testified about their experiences with various unidentified objects, including triangles, cubes, and Tic Tacs. They claim that the government has suppressed reports and retaliated against whistleblowers who have attempted to bring attention to these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’m no military expert, but that’s not business as usual,” said an anonymous source commenting on the missile's failure to engage the object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident adds to a growing list of reported encounters with UAPs by military personnel. Previous incidents have raised concerns about the government's transparency regarding such phenomena and the potential implications for national security. The military's approach to UAPs has evolved, with increased scrutiny and calls for accountability from veterans and advocacy groups.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident, examining the video evidence and gathering testimonies from military personnel involved. Further discussions in Congress may also address the need for clearer policies regarding UAP encounters.</p>
