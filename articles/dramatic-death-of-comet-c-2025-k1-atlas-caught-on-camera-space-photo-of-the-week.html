      <h2>Dramatic death of Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) caught on camera</h2>

<p>The Gemini North telescope has captured images of Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) breaking apart as it emerged from behind the sun in October 2025. The comet, located approximately 220 million miles (354 million kilometers) away in the constellation Pisces, was first discovered in May 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's disintegration.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights the volatile nature of comets during close solar encounters. Astronomers have noted that such occurrences can provide valuable insights into the structure and behavior of these celestial bodies. The Gemini North telescope, located on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, has played a crucial role in documenting this phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered on May 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet approached its closest point to the sun on October 8, 2025, at a distance of 31 million miles (50 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>The breakup of the comet was observed in early November 2025.</li>
    <li>The images of the comet's disintegration were shared on January 28, 2026.</li>
    <li>Gemini North telescope is located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered in May 2025. It made its closest approach to the sun on October 8, 2025. Following this event, the comet initially emerged intact. However, by early November 2025, the comet's nucleus began to break apart due to extreme solar heating, which caused jets of gas and dust to be released.</p>

<p>The Gemini North telescope captured images of the comet breaking apart in late 2025, revealing three distinct fragments. These images were shared publicly on January 28, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Most comets either survive or never emerge from behind the sun, but Comet K1 did — and in just the right place for telescopes across the world to image its spectacular breakup,” said an astronomer involved in the observation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is one of many comets that have been observed breaking apart as they encounter the sun. This phenomenon is not uncommon, as the intense heat and gravitational forces can weaken a comet's structure. Previous comets have also experienced similar fates during their solar approaches, providing astronomers with critical data on cometary behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the disintegration of Comet K1, astronomers are preparing to observe Comet C/2026 A1 (MAPS), which is set to make a close approach to the sun on April 4, 2026. This comet may also face similar challenges during its solar encounter, and its behavior will be closely monitored.</p>
