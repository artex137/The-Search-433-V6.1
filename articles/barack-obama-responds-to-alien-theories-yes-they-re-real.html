      <h2>Barack Obama Responds to Alien Theories: ‘Yes, They’re Real’</h2>

<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama has addressed the question of extraterrestrial life in a recent interview, stating, “They’re real,” during a segment on The Late Late Show with James Corden. Obama, who served as President from 2009 to 2017, made these remarks while discussing unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) on October 26, 2023.</p>

<p>Obama's comments are significant as they highlight ongoing government investigations into UAPs and the public's growing curiosity about the existence of extraterrestrial life. His remarks come amid increasing scrutiny and interest in reports of unidentified objects observed by military personnel.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Obama stated, “They’re real,” during an interview on October 26, 2023.</li>
  <li>He clarified that he has not seen aliens and there is no secret facility at Area 51.</li>
  <li>In a 2021 report, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence analyzed 144 UAP incidents from 2004 to 2021.</li>
  <li>Only one of the 144 incidents was conclusively explained; the rest remain unresolved due to insufficient data.</li>
  <li>As of 2023, 41% of Americans believe some UFO sightings are alien spacecraft, a record high since 1973.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, the U.S. Air Force initiated Project Blue Book to investigate UFO sightings, concluding most were misidentified phenomena or hoaxes. The project, which ended in 1969, left about 701 cases unexplained.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report on UAPs, identifying 144 incidents from military personnel over a 17-year span. The report stated only one incident was explained, with the rest lacking sufficient data for conclusions.</p>
<p>On October 26, 2023, Barack Obama addressed the topic of aliens and UAPs during an interview, reiterating the lack of definitive evidence regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There’s no underground facility. Unless there’s this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the President of the United States,” Obama said, emphasizing skepticism toward conspiracy theories.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don’t know exactly what they are,” he added during the interview.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Public interest in UFOs has grown significantly in recent years. According to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey, about 65% of Americans believe intelligent life exists on other planets. The conversation about UAPs has shifted from mere speculation to a more serious inquiry into national security.</p>
<p>In 2021, a preliminary report revealed that the U.S. government does not have all the answers regarding UAPs, leading to increased calls for transparency and further investigation into aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAPs are ongoing, with NASA and the Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) expected to release further updates. The lack of definitive answers continues to fuel public interest and curiosity about the mysteries of the skies.</p>
