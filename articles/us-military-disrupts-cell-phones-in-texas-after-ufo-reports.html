      <h2>US military disrupts cell phones in Texas after UFO reports</h2>

<p>Widespread cell phone disruptions have begun across Texas as the US military conducts testing of anti-drone systems near Fort Hood, which could affect thousands of Americans. The disruptions, which started on February 2, are expected to continue through February 27, coinciding with recent UFO sightings near El Paso.</p>

<p>The military has warned that the testing could degrade GPS accuracy for aircraft, drones, and consumer devices in major cities including Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. This comes just days after a security incident in El Paso led to an abrupt airspace shutdown, initially attributed to a party balloon, but which has raised questions among UFO researchers and witnesses.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Disruptions began on February 2 and are scheduled to continue until February 27.</li>
    <li>Affected areas include Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and parts of Oklahoma City.</li>
    <li>The airspace over El Paso was closed at 11:30 p.m. MT on February 10.</li>
    <li>The FAA initially announced the airspace shutdown would last for ten days.</li>
    <li>The military is testing anti-drone systems designed to interfere with GPS signals.</li>
    <li>Witnesses have reported UFO sightings in the El Paso area on multiple occasions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 2, the US military began testing anti-drone systems at Fort Hood, leading to cell phone disruptions across Texas. On February 10, the FAA closed airspace over El Paso at 11:30 p.m. MT due to a security incident. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a large object releasing smaller objects near El Paso International Airport shortly before the closure.</p>
<p>Following the shutdown, the FAA described the object as a party balloon, but this explanation has been met with skepticism from UFO researchers and some witnesses. Reports of unusual aerial sightings continued to emerge from the area, prompting further investigation and concern.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The military is intentionally creating GPS-denied conditions to train forces and evaluate how systems perform when signals are blocked or unreliable,” a military spokesperson stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a series of unusual aerial sightings in the US, particularly in regions close to military installations. The FAA's abrupt airspace shutdowns have drawn public scrutiny, especially when initial explanations have changed rapidly. The military conducts regular counter-drone training at Fort Hood, which has implications for both civilian air traffic and public perception of aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The military plans to continue its testing schedule as scheduled, while the FAA has urged pilots experiencing GPS disruptions to report any anomalies. Investigations into the UFO sightings in the El Paso area are ongoing, as authorities seek to clarify the nature of the objects reported by witnesses.</p>
