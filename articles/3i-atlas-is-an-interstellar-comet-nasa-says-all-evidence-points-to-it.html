      <h2>3I/ATLAS Is An Interstellar Comet - NASA Says 'All Evidence Points To It'</h2>

<p>NASA has announced that Comet 3I/ATLAS is confirmed as an interstellar comet, according to statements made by associate administrator Amit Kshatriya and Dr. Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA Science. The announcement was made during a press briefing on [date not disclosed], where they also revealed a new image captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it enhances our understanding of the origins of comets and their pathways through the solar system. NASA officials are currently analyzing data from the MRO to further investigate the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and its interstellar journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Confirmed as interstellar by NASA</li>
    <li>Statements made by Amit Kshatriya and Dr. Nicky Fox</li>
    <li>New image released from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
    <li>Date of announcement: [date not disclosed]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has tracked Comet 3I/ATLAS since its discovery. The comet's trajectory has been analyzed, leading to the conclusion that it originates from outside our solar system. This data has been collected over a series of observations conducted by various NASA missions.</p>

<p>Additional details regarding the comet's path and characteristics are being compiled as scientists continue to study the newly released images from the MRO.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “All evidence points that 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet,” said Amit Kshatriya during the press briefing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The new image from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter provides valuable insights into the comet’s structure,” noted Dr. Nicky Fox.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects is rare, with 3I/ATLAS being one of the few identified to date. Prior to this, the first confirmed interstellar object, 'Oumuamua, was detected in 2017, sparking interest in the study of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>NASA has been actively monitoring potential interstellar objects to better understand their origins and compositions, which could shed light on the formation of our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the data collected from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and other missions. Further studies are expected to provide more detailed information about Comet 3I/ATLAS and its interstellar journey.</p>
