      <h2>3I/ATLAS: NASA Calls It a Comet, Harvard Scientist Avi Loeb Suggests Alien Technology</h2>

<p>The scientific debate over the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has intensified, as Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has accused NASA of ignoring evidence that suggests the object may be artificial. While NASA maintains that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, Loeb argues that specific anomalies warrant further investigation into its origins. This discourse is occurring as the object approaches Earth, with significant celestial events expected in December 2023.</p>

<p>This matter is crucial as it may reshape our understanding of interstellar objects and the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. Authorities are currently engaged in a high-stakes dialogue over the nature of 3I/ATLAS, with Loeb challenging NASA to provide a scientific explanation for the anomalies surrounding the object. The debate raises questions about the classification of celestial bodies and the implications for astrobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 170 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet.</li>
    <li>Loeb identifies anomalies including a retrograde orbit and a rhythmic luminosity variation.</li>
    <li>The object is described as possibly the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Nasa states that the object has a coma consistent with known cometary behaviour.</li>
    <li>Loeb has called for the publication of unedited raw data regarding 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to have a close approach to Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet based on spectral analysis. In contrast, Avi Loeb has publicly challenged this classification, citing anomalies that suggest the object may be artificial. Recent observations have indicated that 3I/ATLAS exhibits a rhythmic luminosity, which Loeb describes as a 'heartbeat' signal. This has prompted further scrutiny of NASA's conclusions.</p>

<p>Loeb has urged NASA to conduct a more rigorous investigation and to share unedited data regarding the object. He emphasizes the importance of monitoring 3I/ATLAS, particularly during its anticipated close approach to Jupiter in March 2026. This event could provide critical evidence regarding the object's origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Even if this explanation turns out to be wrong, we must take it seriously because of its huge implications to society. Admitting that there are mysterious facts about 3I/ATLAS endows us with the curiosity to learn something new,” Loeb stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While it displays unusual features, none of those anomalies point to evidence of artificial origin,” NASA officials have maintained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This debate over 3I/ATLAS is not the first instance of contention between scientists regarding celestial objects. The classification and interpretation of interstellar phenomena have historically led to differing opinions within the scientific community. The current discourse reflects broader trends in astrobiology and the increasing interest in potential extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions continue, NASA is expected to maintain its position on the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Meanwhile, Loeb and other researchers will likely persist in calling for further investigation into the object's anomalies, especially as it approaches Jupiter in 2026.</p>
