      <h2>Two Cosmic Mysteries: 3I/ATLAS Approaches Sun as 12P/Pons-Brooks Sends Signals</h2>

<p>Space watchers are observing significant developments as the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun while the Halley-type comet 12P/Pons-Brooks emits unusual radio signals. These phenomena have captured the attention of astronomers worldwide as they study the implications for understanding cometary physics.</p>

<p>The discoveries surrounding 3I/ATLAS and 12P/Pons-Brooks are critical to advancing scientific knowledge about the solar system's formation and the behaviour of cosmic materials. Authorities, including the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, are actively analyzing data from telescopes to unravel the mysteries posed by these comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object approaching the Sun.</li>
    <li>Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks has emitted unusual radio signals, as reported by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory.</li>
    <li>12P/Pons-Brooks released over five tonnes of water vapour every second at its closest approach of one astronomical unit.</li>
    <li>Ammonia has been detected for the first time in 12P/Pons-Brooks.</li>
    <li>NASA researcher Martin Cordiner has studied the isotopic signature of water in Halley-type comets.</li>
    <li>Future studies could improve planetary defence and guide the design of cometary sample collection missions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS nears the Sun, astronomers have noted its trajectory and spectral emissions, prompting further investigation. The Shanghai Astronomical Observatory reported radio signals from 12P/Pons-Brooks in 2024, coinciding with its closest approach to the Sun. Observations have revealed that the comet's surface reacts to solar heating, indicating significant activity.</p>

<p>Research teams have modelled water production during the comet's outbursts, finding that 12P/Pons-Brooks exhibits more activity than other Halley-type comets. The detection of ammonia molecules suggests the presence of chemical reservoirs beneath the surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These results could further our understanding of the composition and activity of Halley-type comets,” researchers concluded.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA researcher Martin Cordiner stated, “Our new results provide the strongest evidence yet that at least some Halley-type comets carried water with the same isotopic signature as that found on Earth.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discoveries about 3I/ATLAS and 12P/Pons-Brooks reflect ongoing research into the origins and evolution of comets. Previous studies have suggested that comets may have played a role in delivering essential ingredients for life on Earth. The current findings bolster this theory by providing new insights into the chemical processes occurring in these ancient celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, while further analysis of 12P/Pons-Brooks' signals is expected to yield additional insights. These findings may enhance future planetary defence strategies and inform the design of exploratory missions to collect cometary materials.</p>
