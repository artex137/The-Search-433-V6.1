      <h2>Where We Might Find Aliens in the Next Decade</h2>

<p>Scientists are currently engaged in multiple efforts to search for extraterrestrial life, with significant developments expected within the next decade. These searches are taking place on Mars, icy moons of our solar system, and in the atmospheres of exoplanets. Results could reshape our understanding of life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>This search for alien life is not just a speculative endeavor; it involves systematic scientific processes. Authorities, including NASA, are deploying advanced technology to explore potential habitats. The implications of these findings could fundamentally alter humanity's perspective on its existence in the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA's Perseverance rover is collecting samples from Jezero Crater on Mars.</li>
    <li>The Mars Sample Return mission aims to return samples to Earth in the early 2030s.</li>
    <li>Potential evidence of life on Mars could come from interactions between rocks and water.</li>
    <li>Scientists are also investigating icy moons like Europa and Enceladus for signs of life.</li>
    <li>Funding challenges have affected the Mars Sample Return mission, particularly due to budget cuts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the mid-20th Century, astronomers initiated the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) by looking for radio signals. Over the years, significant advancements have occurred, including the discovery of Mars's dry surface and the identification of its past habitability.</p>
<p>Currently, NASA's Perseverance rover is actively collecting samples from Mars, with the goal of returning these samples to Earth in the early 2030s. This mission faces funding difficulties but remains a priority for researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If we were to find life on the icy moons, we would be sure this is a different genesis of life from Earth,” says Susanne Schwenzer, a planetary scientist at The Open University in the UK.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I think in 10 years we’ll have some evidence about whether there’s anything organic on some nearby planets,” says Lord Martin Rees, the UK astronomer royal.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The search for alien life has evolved significantly since early attempts to find extraterrestrial intelligence. Initial beliefs about Mars hosting life have shifted as scientists have confirmed its desolate environment. Today, Mars remains a focal point for exploration, alongside the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn, which are thought to harbor conditions conducive to life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations will continue as NASA and other agencies work to secure funding for the Mars Sample Return mission. The scientific community anticipates crucial findings in the coming years that may provide insights into the existence of life beyond Earth.</p>
