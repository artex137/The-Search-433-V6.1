      <h2>Tennessee Congressman Doubles Down On Notion That There Are 'Five Or Six' Underwater Alien Bases</h2>

<p>Tennessee Congressman Tim Burchett has reiterated his claims that the United States government possesses knowledge of underwater alien bases. Burchett made these remarks on Thursday in Washington D.C., following a hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>This assertion raises questions about government transparency regarding UAPs and possible extraterrestrial activity. Burchett suggests that there are “entities” located at five or six deep-water sites on Earth, indicating that the government may be withholding information from the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Congressman Tim Burchett has claimed the existence of underwater alien bases.</li>
    <li>Burchett stated there are “five or six” deep-water sites with entities.</li>
    <li>He emphasized the need for transparency regarding UAP sightings.</li>
    <li>Burchett has previously alleged government cover-ups related to UFOs since at least 2023.</li>
    <li>Burchett expressed skepticism about the Pentagon's openness regarding military contractors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday, following a hearing on UAPs, Congressman Burchett made his latest claims about underwater alien bases in Washington D.C. He highlighted the discrepancy between reported UAP speeds and conventional military capabilities.</p>

<p>Burchett has been vocal about his beliefs regarding UAPs and government secrecy since at least 2023, suggesting that the government has been concealing significant findings related to UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What if these are entities that are here on this Earth, have been on this Earth for who knows how long?” Burchett asked. “We have a higher propensity of sightings around these five or six, I believe, deep-water areas.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the Pentagon’s handling of information, Burchett stated, “Oh, it’s 100% what they do. They pass it on, and we can’t FOIA it because it’s just outside of our purview.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Burchett has a history of making controversial claims regarding UAPs, alleging that the government is not forthcoming about its findings. His assertions about underwater alien bases tap into a long-standing narrative about extraterrestrial life and government cover-ups.</p>

<p>Previous discussions around UAPs have highlighted the need for greater transparency from military and government agencies regarding unidentified sightings and encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Burchett's claims may prompt further discussions in Congress about the need for transparency regarding UAP investigations and military operations related to unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
