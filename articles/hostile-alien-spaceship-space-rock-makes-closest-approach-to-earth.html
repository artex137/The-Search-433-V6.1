      <h2>'Hostile alien spaceship' space rock makes closest approach to Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as Comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, flying by at a distance of approximately 170 million miles. The Manhattan-sized comet was first spotted by Hawaii's ATLAS survey earlier this year.</p>

<p>This event has generated significant interest due to speculation surrounding the comet's origin and characteristics. Authorities and scientists have been closely monitoring the object, with NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) providing updates on its behavior and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>First spotted:</strong> 2025 by Hawaii's ATLAS survey</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Manhattan-sized</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> NASA, ESA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected earlier in 2025 during routine observations by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii. As the comet approached, scientists began to analyze its trajectory and characteristics. On December 19, it made its closest pass to Earth, drawing attention from both the scientific community and the public.</p>

<p>As the comet neared, discussions arose regarding its unusual luminosity and trajectory, leading to various theories about its nature, including claims by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggesting it could be an artificial probe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity, and would possibly require defensive measures to be undertaken (though these might prove futile),” said a scientific paper co-authored by Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Speculation surrounding Comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked debates about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and artificial objects in space. While some experts have raised concerns, mainstream scientists from NASA and ESA have dismissed these theories, stating there is no evidence of propulsion or structure, attributing the comet's behavior to standard cometary activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS exits our solar system, scientists will continue to analyze data collected during its approach. Further studies may provide insights into the characteristics of interstellar objects and their implications for future space exploration.</p>
