      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows no signs of extraterrestrial technology</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown no evidence of extraterrestrial technology, according to recent studies conducted by researchers at the Green Bank Telescope. The findings were released on December 31, 2025, following observations made on December 18, 2025, the day before the comet's closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it addresses widespread speculation about the comet potentially containing signs of advanced alien civilizations. The Breakthrough Listen program, which aims to detect signs of extraterrestrial life, has confirmed that no technosignatures have been detected from 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted with the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope.</li>
    <li>Data collection included over 471,000 candidate signals, narrowed down to nine events.</li>
    <li>No technosignatures detected, consistent with other studies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, and quickly attracted attention due to speculation regarding its nature. On December 18, 2025, researchers conducted radio observations at the Green Bank Telescope as part of the Breakthrough Listen program, aiming to identify any signals indicating extraterrestrial technology. The comet made its closest approach to Earth the following day, December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>After analyzing the data, scientists found that the nine candidate signals were the result of radio frequency interference, not evidence of alien technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our survey concludes that there are no isotropic continuous-wave transmitters above 0.1W at the location of 3I/ATLAS,” the study authors stated. “For comparison, a cell phone is an approximately isotropic continuous-wave transmitter at a level of ∼1W.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object (ISO) to be observed entering our solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The previous ISOs have also sparked speculation regarding their origins and characteristics, but studies have consistently found no evidence of alien technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Data collection will continue using various telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope. Researchers remain vigilant in their search for future ISOs and potential technosignatures, although it is currently deemed unlikely that further evidence of extraterrestrial technology will be found from 3I/ATLAS.</p>
