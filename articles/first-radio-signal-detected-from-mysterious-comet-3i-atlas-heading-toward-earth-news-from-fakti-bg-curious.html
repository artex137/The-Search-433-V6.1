      <h2>First radio signal detected from mysterious comet 3I/ATLAS heading toward Earth</h2>

<p>On October 24, 2025, scientists detected the first radio signal from the comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently heading toward Earth, according to The Astronomer's Telegram. The signal was received by the MeerKAT radio telescope located in South Africa. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first successful detection of radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS, which was identified as a comet from another solar system. Authorities, including scientists from Harvard University, are preparing for further observations. The Juno spacecraft is scheduled to attempt a detection of a low-frequency radio signal from the comet on March 16, 2026, during its flyby of Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>First radio signal detected on October 24, 2025.</li>
<li>Signal received by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</li>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
<li>Diameter of the comet's coma is approximately 24 kilometers.</li>
<li>Estimated age of 3I/ATLAS is over 7.5 billion years.</li>
<li>Previous attempts to detect emissions began on September 28, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, as an interstellar object. Scientists made several attempts to detect its radio emissions, with initial efforts starting on September 28, 2025. On October 24, the MeerKAT radio telescope successfully detected the first radio signal from the comet.</p>
<p>In September, Harvard University scientist Avi Loeb reported that 3I/ATLAS had undergone an “anomalous evolution,” indicating a change in color. This finding has raised interest in the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of this radio signal is a significant breakthrough in our understanding of interstellar comets,” said Avi Loeb, a scientist from Harvard University. “We look forward to further observations as 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being potentially the oldest comet ever observed, at over three billion years older than the Sun. Its discovery contributes to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar objects and their behavior as they travel through our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Juno spacecraft is set to attempt a low-frequency radio signal detection from 3I/ATLAS on March 16, 2026, as it passes by Jupiter. Scientists will continue to monitor the comet for further developments and data collection.</p>
