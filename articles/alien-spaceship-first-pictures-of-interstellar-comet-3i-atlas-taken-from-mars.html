      <h2>Alien spaceship? First pictures of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas taken from Mars</h2>

<p>In an extraordinary astronomical event, the Chinese Mars orbiter Tianwen-1 has captured the first close-up images of Comet 3I/Atlas as it made a close flyby of Mars on October 3, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as Comet 3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. The images, which reveal a bright yet faint cometary nucleus surrounded by a glowing coma, provide new insights into this rare interstellar visitor. According to reports, NASA has not yet provided clear answers regarding the comet's nature, despite the online speculation about it being an "alien spaceship."</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet passed within approximately 28 million kilometers (0.19 AU) of Mars.</li>
    <li>The images were captured by the Tianwen-1 orbiter, which has been orbiting Mars since 2021.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is several hundred meters to under a kilometer across.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble and Webb Space Telescopes, along with the European Space Agency’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, have also observed the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered by ATLAS in Chile. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, coming within about 28 million kilometers of the planet. The Tianwen-1 orbiter captured images of the comet during this flyby, revealing its faint characteristics. The images were released on November 6, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Far from an alien spaceship, Comet 3I/Atlas's ghostly appearance is a cosmic messenger from deep space,” said a representative from the Chinese space agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is notable for its hyperbolic trajectory and active gas emissions, which distinguish it from typical comets originating in the Solar System. The event highlights China's increasing role in Mars exploration and interstellar science, contributing valuable perspectives to the study of celestial bodies from the Martian vantage point.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to release additional images of Comet 3I/Atlas once the US government shutdown lifts. Scientists worldwide are eager to analyze the data collected from both Mars and Earth-based observations.</p>
