      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS found releasing water in space far from the Sun, NASA, ESA confirm</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected water on comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, as it approached Mars on October 3. This is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system.</p>

<p>The discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge of comet behavior, particularly at great distances from the Sun. The European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express observed the comet during its closest approach, which was approximately 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometres) from Mars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet passed within 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometres) of Mars.</li>
    <li>It travels at nearly 130,000 miles per hour (210,000 kilometres per hour).</li>
    <li>Researchers detected a release of about 40 kilograms of water every second.</li>
    <li>Approximately 8% of the comet's surface is actively venting vapour.</li>
    <li>This finding was confirmed by researchers from Auburn University and NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars, prompting observations by the European Space Agency.</p>
<p>Prior to this, between July and mid-August, researchers noted a sharp increase in hydroxyl emissions, indicating the presence of water vapour.</p>
<p>This study, led by Zexi Xing, utilized NASA's equipment to confirm the water signature on the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Each interstellar comet that has come by so far has been a surprise. ‘Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was carbon monoxide-rich, and now ATLAS is shedding water where we didn’t expect it,” said lead researcher Zexi Xing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The finding of water on 3I/ATLAS is notable because it is occurring at a distance three times farther from the Sun than Earth, where conditions are typically too cold for normal sublimation. This suggests that interstellar comets may behave differently from those originating within our solar system.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar comets, including ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, exhibited different chemical compositions, highlighting the variety among these celestial visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study comet 3I/ATLAS to better understand its composition and behavior, particularly how it sheds water at such a great distance from the Sun.</p>
