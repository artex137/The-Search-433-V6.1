      <p class="byline">Published 2026-01-17 16:32 UTC</p>

      <h2>NASA’s TESS abruptly pivots to watch interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS — what it’s looking for</h2>

<p>NASA has announced that its Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will temporarily halt part of its observing schedule to track the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. This decision was made public on January 17, 2026, with no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This shift in focus is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA will calibrate the data collected from the comet and make it publicly available immediately, according to agency officials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of announcement:</strong> January 17, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Comet designation:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First spotted:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the sun:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth at closest approach:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 170 million miles) on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed at first observation:</strong> 137,000 miles per hour; increased to 153,000 mph at perihelion</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Expected to be visible from Earth with a small telescope through spring 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. It made its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2025, before passing Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 170 million miles. NASA confirmed the comet's interstellar origin due to its hyperbolic orbit.</p>
<p>Following its closest solar pass, TESS has shifted its observing schedule to monitor the comet's activity and changes in brightness as it moves away from the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The data collected from this comet will be calibrated and made publicly accessible following the mission’s usual protocols,” NASA stated in their announcement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is a very precious opportunity to catch 3I/ATLAS live,” said Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project in Italy, describing the comet's visibility.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS provide valuable insights into the materials that formed around other stars. This can help scientists understand the development of planets and smaller bodies in other solar systems. Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also drawn significant interest from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the sun. The data set will be made publicly available, allowing researchers to analyze and compare the comet's characteristics with other comets formed in our solar system.</p>
