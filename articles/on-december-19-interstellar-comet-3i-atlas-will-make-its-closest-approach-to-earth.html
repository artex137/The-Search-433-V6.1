      <h2>On December 19, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers. There are no reported risks of impact or threats to the planet during this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This approach provides a unique opportunity for astronomers to study the comet's composition. Space agencies have continuously monitored 3I/ATLAS since its discovery in July 2025, allowing for in-depth research on this cosmic visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 270 million kilometers (1.8 astronomical units)</li>
    <li>Speed: Exceeding 200,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest point to the Sun): October 2025</li>
    <li>Expected encounter with Jupiter: 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile. Initial observations confirmed its cometary activity, including the formation of a coma and tail. The comet reached perihelion in October 2025, exhibiting significant cometary characteristics.</p>

<p>Throughout November 2025, space telescopes captured images of the comet, revealing a reddish coma and signs of dust. Continuous observations have allowed scientists to refine their understanding of the comet's speed and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The approach of 3I/ATLAS offers an unprecedented chance to study an interstellar object and learn more about the materials in other star systems,” said a representative from the ATLAS astronomical research system.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to transit the Solar System, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Each discovery enhances our understanding of the variety of objects that traverse the Milky Way.</p>

<p>The comet is estimated to be billions of years old, potentially older than the Solar System itself. Its composition may provide insights into planet formation in different environments across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach to Earth, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey towards Jupiter in 2026, where its trajectory will shift slightly due to the planet's gravitational influence before it is ejected into interstellar space.</p>
