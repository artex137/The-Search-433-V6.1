      <h2>Not All Ice Escaping From Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Forms The Same Shape</h2>

<p>A recent analysis of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has revealed significant changes experienced by the comet before and after its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, according to NASA. The comet reached perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, at a distance of 203 million kilometers (126 million miles), approximately 36 percent further than the average distance between Earth and the Sun.</p>

<p>This analysis matters because it provides new insights into the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS, which has not approached a star in at least 10 million years, and possibly billions. NASA has released images captured by the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) during the comet's journey, allowing scientists to study its ice distribution and shape.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: 203 million kilometers (126 million miles)</li>
    <li>Observations conducted by SPHEREx in August and December 2023</li>
    <li>Next survey planned for April 2026</li>
    <li>Ice composition includes water, nitrides, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2023, SPHEREx began observing 3I/ATLAS as it approached the Sun. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023. Following this, additional observations were made in December, contributing to a better understanding of the comet's changes.</p>

<p>The analysis of the December data is ongoing, with scientists noting that it is not a complete study yet. The final results will be produced before 3I/ATLAS passes through SPHEREx's survey pattern again in April 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The spectrophotometric measurements reported here are from a preliminary analysis. A more full-up treatment will be produced before 3I/ATLAS passes through SPHEREx’s planned survey pattern again in April 2026,” the authors wrote.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This analysis of 3I/ATLAS is part of ongoing research into the behavior and composition of comets. The insights gained from this comet may help scientists understand the history of our Solar System and the materials that formed it. Previous studies have indicated that comets can provide valuable data about the early conditions of planetary formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS, with a more comprehensive study expected before the next survey in April 2026. Further observations will likely enhance the understanding of the comet's evolution and its interaction with solar radiation.</p>
