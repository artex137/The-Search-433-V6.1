      <h2>Studying a distant visitor: What we know about Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), has been discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) station in Chile in July 2025. This comet, which poses no threat of impact, will pass through our Solar System and continue its journey through the galaxy.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it offers a rare opportunity to study material from beyond our Solar System. Dr. Bryce Bolin, a research scientist at Eureka Scientific Incorporated, has led studies on this interstellar comet. He has previously studied all three known interstellar objects, providing insight into their characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Chile (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System)</li>
    <li>Current brightness: approximately 17th to 18th magnitude</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: around 1 kilometre</li>
    <li>Observable until: late August to early September 2025</li>
    <li>Future observations: James Webb Space Telescope planned</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was first spotted by the ATLAS station in Chile. The comet has been observed using various telescopes, including the Keck Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope. These observations have provided information on its brightness and potential composition.</p>
<p>Dr. Bolin has noted that the comet will pass close to the orbit of Mars, presenting an opportunity for spacecraft at Mars to observe it. The comet will become less visible as it approaches solar conjunction in early September 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects provide one of our only opportunities to observe material coming into our Solar System from somewhere else entirely,” said Sarah Al-Ahmed, host of Planetary Radio.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s just mind-blowing,” Dr. Bolin stated. “The difference between theory and what we actually observe can be quite large.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to be discovered, following 1I/Ê»Oumuamua in October 2017 and 2I/Borisov in August 2019. The study of these objects contributes to our understanding of planetary systems beyond our own and the formation of celestial bodies in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are planned using the James Webb Space Telescope to analyze the comet's gas emissions and physical characteristics. Researchers aim to gather more data before it becomes less visible due to solar conjunction.</p>
