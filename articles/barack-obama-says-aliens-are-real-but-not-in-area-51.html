      <h2>Barack Obama Says Aliens Are Real, but Not in Area 51</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life during an interview with journalist Brian Tyler Cohen, published on Saturday. Obama stated, “They’re real,” while dismissing conspiracy theories surrounding Area 51.</p>

<p>This statement is significant as it aligns with current discussions regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and ongoing testimonies before the House Oversight and Government Reform Task Force. Authorities are facing increasing pressure to provide transparency regarding military encounters with UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interview conducted by Brian Tyler Cohen, published on Saturday.</li>
    <li>Obama confirmed aliens are real but stated they are not housed in Area 51.</li>
    <li>Military veterans have testified about UAPs at recent congressional hearings.</li>
    <li>Dylan Borland described a triangular aircraft observed at Langley Air Force Base in 2012.</li>
    <li>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna criticized the Defense Department for a lack of transparency regarding UAPs.</li>
    <li>Rep. Eric Burlison presented video evidence of an MQ-9 Reaper striking an unidentified orb in October 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the interview, Obama responded to Cohen's direct question about the existence of aliens. He affirmed their reality while specifically mentioning that they are not located in Area 51. This exchange occurred in a light-hearted manner, concluding with laughter.</p>

<p>In September 2025, Air Force veteran Dylan Borland testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Task Force, detailing his encounter with a triangular aircraft at Langley Air Force Base in 2012. He reported experiencing workplace retaliation after submitting his report to the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).</p>

<p>Additionally, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna voiced concerns over the Defense Department's transparency regarding UAP incidents during the same hearings, asserting that the American public deserves access to this information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States,” Obama said during the interview.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The American people are not fragile and do not need to be shielded like children from reality,” Rep. Luna stated regarding the lack of transparency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I’m not going to speculate what it is. But the question is, why are we being blocked from this information?” Rep. Burlison asked while presenting video evidence.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Obama's remarks come in the wake of a growing public interest in UAPs and government transparency. Recent testimonies have revealed concerns among military personnel about their encounters with unidentified objects, leading to calls for more open investigations.</p>

<p>The AARO has maintained that it has found no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial activity, despite numerous reports and testimonies from military veterans.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating UAP incidents, with ongoing congressional hearings aimed at increasing transparency regarding military encounters. Further testimonies and evidence may be presented in the coming months as the task force pursues its inquiry.</p>
