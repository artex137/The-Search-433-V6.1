      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Flyby: How Close Did It Get and Its Future Trajectory</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed through our solar system, coming closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 1 a.m. EST, located around 168 million miles away. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of just three objects known to have entered our solar system from interstellar space. NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth, as its distance is over 700 times that between Earth and the moon. Observatories and skywatching events have been encouraged for those wishing to view the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 1 a.m. EST.</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 168 million miles.</li>
    <li>Not visible to the naked eye; viewable through telescopes.</li>
    <li>Visible direction: east to northeast, under the star Regulus in the constellation Leo.</li>
    <li>Livestream event hosted by the Virtual Telescope Project on December 19, starting at 11 p.m. ET.</li>
    <li>Trajectory: hyperbolic, not bound by the sun's gravity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025. It reached its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2025, coming within about 130 million miles of the sun, inside the orbit of Mars. After passing behind the sun, it re-emerged in early December. The comet had its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and will continue its hyperbolic trajectory out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa has stressed that the comet poses no threat to Earth—this number is still more than 700 times the distance between the Earth and the moon.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system. Its discovery highlights the ongoing interest in interstellar objects and their origins, contributing to our understanding of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue on its trajectory out of the solar system, with no expected changes to its path. Observers are encouraged to take advantage of potential viewing opportunities through telescopes and livestreams.</p>
