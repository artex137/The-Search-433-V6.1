      <h2>Vice President JD Vance Declares Commitment to UFO Investigation</h2>
<p>Vice President JD Vance has publicly committed to investigating UFOs and extraterrestrial life during his term in office, stating this in an interview that aired on November 3, 2025. Vance, who described himself as a "UFO lunatic," aims to explore classified government files related to unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) before the next election.</p>

<p>This initiative comes amid growing interest among high-ranking officials in the Trump Administration, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who also seek answers regarding UFOs. Vance's comments reflect a significant push for transparency concerning government knowledge of extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Vance has expressed a desire to investigate UFOs during his term in office.</li>
    <li>He declared himself a "UFO lunatic" during a podcast interview.</li>
    <li>Vance plans to explore government files on UAPs before the next election.</li>
    <li>Other officials, including Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, have shown interest in UFO investigations.</li>
    <li>No verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial life has been publicly presented.</li>
    <li>A documentary titled "The Age of Disclosure" is set to be released in late November, alleging government secrecy on UFOs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2025, Vance announced plans to take time off during the congressional recess to investigate UFO-related files. He later reiterated his commitment to uncovering the truth about UFOs in an interview with Miranda Devine on November 3, 2025.</p>
<p>During the interview, Vance mentioned that other members of the Trump Administration, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, share his interest in the subject. Gabbard has previously stated her belief in the existence of UFOs and noted ongoing investigations into unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is the crazy person inside of me. All of us put the tinfoil hat on from time to time. I can’t allow myself to become so busy that I spend the next three years and I don’t get to the bottom of this,” said Vance in the interview.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Even presidents have been operating on a need-to-know basis, but that begins to ramp out of control,” Rubio claimed in the upcoming documentary.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The renewed interest in UFOs comes after a series of congressional hearings on UAPs, where military personnel and civilians have reported sightings. However, skeptics argue that the lack of peer-reviewed scientific data and reliance on anecdotal evidence raises doubts about the validity of these claims.</p>
<p>Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has echoed Vance's sentiments, linking biblical texts to modern UFO sightings and suggesting that some encounters may involve "interdimensional" beings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Vance plans to delve into the investigation of UFOs and UAPs throughout his term, with a focus on transparency and public awareness. The documentary "The Age of Disclosure" is expected to provide more insights into government actions and claims regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>
