      <h2>NASA explains why the new HiRISE image of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas looks fuzzy while amateur astronomers capture clearer views</h2>

<p>NASA has faced criticism after its live press event on November 21, 2025, where it provided images of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas that many viewers found disappointing. The images were blurry and basic, leading to frustration among sky watchers who had anticipated clearer visuals following a delay due to a government shutdown.</p>

<p>The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS observatory in Chile, has drawn significant attention due to its unusual features. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has identified 12 peculiar aspects of 3I/Atlas, including its trajectory and chemical composition. NASA’s inability to deliver high-quality images has raised questions about the capabilities of its equipment and the nature of the comet itself.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of discovery: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Press event date: November 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: ATLAS observatory, Chile</li>
    <li>NASA instruments used: HiRISE, MAVEN, STEREO, SOHO, Psyche, Lucy</li>
    <li>Key critic: Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS observatory discovered comet 3I/Atlas. Following its discovery, the comet gained attention for its unusual features. After a delay caused by a government shutdown, NASA held a press event on November 21, 2025, to release images of the comet. However, the images were criticized for being fuzzy and indistinct.</p>

<p>In response to the backlash, NASA explained that its spacecraft are not designed to capture fast-moving, faint objects like 3I/Atlas from vast distances. They noted that their instruments are primarily built for imaging brighter and closer celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa stated, “Our spacecraft was not designed to capture fast-moving, faint interstellar objects from huge distances.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb remarked, “Obvious facts might be covering up bigger questions that need attention.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>NASA has a history of capturing high-quality images of celestial objects, primarily focusing on planets and other nearby bodies. The disappointment surrounding the images of 3I/Atlas highlights the challenges faced when observing fast-moving, distant comets. Loeb’s emphasis on the need for deeper scientific inquiry reflects ongoing debates in the astronomical community about the nature of such interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the data from its observations of 3I/Atlas. Meanwhile, discussions surrounding the comet's unusual features and the adequacy of current imaging technology are expected to persist among scientists and amateur astronomers alike.</p>
