      <h2>Mysterious Object 3I/ATLAS May Have Emitted a Signal, Scientist Claims</h2>

<p>In a recent blog post, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, currently moving through our solar system, may have emitted the famous “Wow! Signal” detected by the Ohio State University’s Big Ear radio telescope in 1977. This claim raises questions about the origins of the signal and its potential connection to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>The Wow! Signal, which lasted for 72 seconds, has puzzled scientists for decades, as it has never been detected again. Loeb's theory posits that 3I/ATLAS, which was approximately 600 astronomical units away from Earth at the time of the signal, could be the source. This possibility has prompted renewed interest in the object, which has already captivated researchers due to its unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The Wow! Signal was detected on August 15, 1977.</li>
    <li>Loeb estimates the probability of alignment between the signal and 3I/ATLAS to be about <strong>0.6 percent</strong>.</li>
    <li>Loeb suggests a power source of <strong>0.5 to 2 gigawatts</strong> would be required for the signal to originate from 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The Arecibo Observatory's "Arecibo Wow!" project is re-analyzing the 1977 signal.</li>
    <li>The aim is to archive all data from the Big Ear telescope by <strong>2027</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1977, the Big Ear radio telescope detected a strong radio signal, which was later dubbed the Wow! Signal. The signal has been a subject of speculation regarding its origins, remaining a mystery for over four decades. In July 2023, 3I/ATLAS was observed as it traversed the solar system. Recently, Loeb linked the timing and direction of the object to the Wow! Signal, suggesting a possible connection.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If the ‘Wow! Signal’ originated from 3I/ATLAS, how powerful was the transmitter?” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We aim to archive and share all data from the Big Ear telescope by 2027, marking the 50th anniversary of the Wow! Signal.” - Méndez, Planetary Habitability Laboratory</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Wow! Signal has been a focal point in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence since its detection in 1977. Researchers have explored various theories regarding its origin, with many favoring natural astrophysical explanations. The ongoing work by the Arecibo project aims to provide a clearer understanding of the signal while acknowledging the continued mystery surrounding it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb has called for increased observation of 3I/ATLAS using radio telescopes to determine if it emits any signals, particularly around the hyperfine line of hydrogen. The scientific community continues to evaluate his theory while the Arecibo project works to finalize its analysis of the Wow! Signal by 2027.</p>
