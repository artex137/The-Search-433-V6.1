      <h2>Mysterious ‘alien’ comet 3I/ATLAS set to reach closest point to Earth in just hours as object’s ‘heartbeat’ changes</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, coming within 170 million miles of the planet while travelling at 130,000 miles per hour. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This event has garnered attention from scientists and amateur astronomers alike. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have stated that there is no evidence to suggest the comet is artificially constructed or contains any form of extraterrestrial life. However, some researchers have raised questions about its unusual behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will come within 170 million miles of Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at a speed of 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed there are no technosignatures detected from the comet.</li>
    <li>Independent researcher Andrew Collins has reported a "heartbeat" from the comet that follows a 15.48-hour cycle.</li>
    <li>Collins' findings suggest this cycle aligns with ancient timing systems from Chinese and Indian civilizations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered near our solar system in July. On November 19, NASA held a press conference declaring the object a comet, stating there was no evidence of intelligent life associated with it. As the comet approaches Earth, new data from Spain’s Two-Meter Twin Telescope has revealed changes in its "heartbeat" cycle.</p>

<p>Collins has tracked the comet using both Earth-based and space telescopes since its discovery, noting that the comet has exhibited rhythmic bursts every 16.16 hours, which has since shifted as it nears Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The many anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS strongly hint that it is not a mundane comet but something that could be described as a directed comet,” said Andrew Collins.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It is just nonsense,” said Professor Chris Lintott from the University of Oxford, regarding claims of the comet being anything other than a typical comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time a celestial object has sparked debate among scientists about its origin and behavior. Past incidents have included discussions on the nature of other comets and asteroids. The scientific community remains divided on how to interpret unusual findings in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. NASA and ESA have committed to gathering data to better understand the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>
