      <h2>UFO or Military Tech? Explosive New Footage from U.S. Congress Raises Eyebrows</h2>

<p>A recent U.S. Congressional hearing has revealed a video showing a missile hitting an orb-like object off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. The footage, recorded by an MQ-9 drone, shows the missile striking the object without any visible effect, prompting renewed discussions on government transparency regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>This development has intensified scrutiny of the U.S. government’s handling of UAP investigations. Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) has stated that the hearing aims to expose government cover-ups and provide answers to the public. The video is part of an ongoing investigation into UAPs and raises questions about what additional information may be concealed within government databases.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video recorded on October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Object struck by missile from an undisclosed source</li>
    <li>Witness: U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins</li>
    <li>Previous encounter reported by Wiggins in 2023 off the coast of California</li>
    <li>Congressional hearing highlighted by Representatives Anna Paulina Luna and Eric Burlison</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a video captured by an MQ-9 drone shows a missile striking an orb-like object off Yemen. The missile appears to have no effect on the object, which continues on its path. The U.S. Congressional Unidentified Aerial Phenomena hearing, where the footage was presented, has prompted discussions about government transparency and the withholding of information regarding UAPs.</p>

<p>In 2023, U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins reported a separate encounter involving a Tic Tac-shaped object off the coast of California. He described the object as self-luminous and stated it exhibited unusual movement patterns that defy conventional aircraft capabilities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That’s a hellfire missile smacking into that UFO, and bouncing right off—and it kept going,” said UAP journalist George Knapp, emphasizing the perplexing nature of the footage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It kept going, and it looked like the debris was taken with it,” noted Representative Eric Burlison, raising concerns about the withholding of such footage from the public.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The federal government has been hiding information from Americans for decades,” Representative Anna Paulina Luna stated, reflecting the growing sentiment for transparency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent UAP hearings have sparked intense debate over the U.S. government's role in managing information about aerial phenomena. The discussions have included calls for greater accountability and transparency, not only regarding UAPs but also concerning other government secrets. The release of the missile footage is part of a larger effort to uncover truths that have remained obscured for years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations into UAPs continue, Congress is expected to further examine the implications of the footage and other testimonies. The bipartisan task force aims to enhance public trust by ensuring transparency in government dealings related to UAPs and other sensitive topics.</p>
