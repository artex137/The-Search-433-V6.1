      <h2>Breakthrough Listen Searches Comet 3I/ATLAS for Technosignatures</h2>

<p>During comet 3I/ATLAS's closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, the Breakthrough Listen project conducted a search for signs of technosignatures, or evidence of alien communications. The comet approached Earth at a distance of 1.7 astronomical units (AU), approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) away.</p>

<p>This search is significant as it marks a continued effort to understand interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial life. Scientists have focused on 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar visitor detected by humanity, since its discovery by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System on July 1, 2025. The project aims to gather data that could enhance our understanding of the comet and its origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Breakthrough Listen project utilized the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope for observations.</li>
    <li>The search for technosignatures was conducted on December 18, 2025, less than 24 hours before closest approach.</li>
    <li>The observations covered frequencies ranging from 1 to 12 GHz.</li>
    <li>Scientists found nine events that warranted further inspection but ruled them out as radio-frequency interference (RFI).</li>
    <li>The nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be around 1 km in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The following events outline the key developments regarding comet 3I/ATLAS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>July 1, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.</li>
    <li>December 18, 2025: The Breakthrough Listen project observes 3I/ATLAS using the Green Bank Telescope.</li>
    <li>December 19, 2025: 3I/ATLAS reaches its closest distance to Earth at 1.7 AU.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Unlike 1I/‘Oumuamua, 3I/ATLAS exhibits mostly typical cometary characteristics, including a coma and an unelongated nucleus,” the Breakthrough Listen team stated. “There is currently no evidence to suggest that ISOs are anything other than natural astrophysical objects.” 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “We used four receivers (L, S, C, and X) spanning frequencies of 1 - 12 GHz. At closest approach, the GBT is sensitive to transmitters with an EIRP of approximately 0.1 W, more sensitive than all previous observations,” explained the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and another unidentified object. Scientists continue to study such objects to learn more about their origins and characteristics. The study of technosignatures remains a topic of interest in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Data from the Breakthrough Listen project has been made available to the public, allowing for further analysis. Ongoing studies will continue to explore non-gravitational accelerations and other characteristics of 3I/ATLAS as more observations are conducted.</p>
