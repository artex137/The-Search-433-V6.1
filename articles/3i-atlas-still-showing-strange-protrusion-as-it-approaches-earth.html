      <h2>3I/ATLAS Still Showing Strange Protrusion as It Approaches Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 13, coming within 167 million miles. Astronomers have monitored the object, believed to be a comet, for several months as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<p>This event provides astronomers with a unique opportunity to observe 3I/ATLAS closely. Both ground- and space-based telescopes will focus on the object, which has exhibited an unusual protrusion known as an “anti-tail.” This feature, which points towards the Sun instead of away from it, has sparked interest and debate among scientists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 13, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 167 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>First observed by:</strong> NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location of observation:</strong> Teerasak Thaluang telescope, Rayong, Thailand</li>
    <li><strong>Notable feature:</strong> Anti-tail pointing towards the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope first observed 3I/ATLAS on July 21, 2023. Since then, astronomers have documented the object's unusual features, including its anti-tail. On December 13, 2023, 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>Following its perihelion, or closest pass of the Sun, astronomers have continued to observe 3I/ATLAS, noting the persistence of the anti-tail. A significant image from the Teerasak Thaluang telescope has confirmed its presence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Its nature is a mystery because gas and micrometer-dust particles are expected to be pushed away from the Sun by solar radiation pressure and the solar wind, creating the appearance of a tail,” said Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“All these things are consistent with a comet nucleus of typical size or smaller, sublimating in sunlight and blowing out dust particles,” stated UCLA astronomy professor David Jewitt.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The appearance of an anti-tail is not commonly observed in comets. Astronomers have debated the implications of this feature, with some suggesting it might indicate unusual behavior for a celestial object of this type. The scientific community has previously documented similar phenomena in other comets, but the claims regarding 3I/ATLAS remain contentious.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to gather data and analyze its features. Observations from December 13 and beyond may provide further insights into the nature of the object and the validity of the various hypotheses regarding its behavior.</p>
