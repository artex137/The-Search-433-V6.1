      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows collapse signs from solar heat as it nears perihelion in 2025</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed initial signs of collapse on Thursday, October 30, 2025, during its closest approach to the Sun, approximately 210 million kilometers away. NASA and European Space Agency astronomers are monitoring the comet, which is expected to reach perihelion at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides valuable data regarding the chemical composition of comets from outside the Solar System. Experts have noted that the solar heat is accelerating the sublimation of volatile ices, resulting in jets of gas and dust. As the comet nears perihelion, instability is expected to increase, with potential for core fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Current speed exceeds 60 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Core size is estimated to be under one kilometer in diameter.</li>
    <li>Comet has released dust equivalent to an initial tail of millions of particles.</li>
    <li>Brightness varies between magnitudes 12 and 14, requiring equipment of at least 200 millimeters aperture for viewing.</li>
    <li>Comet is expected to exit the Solar System with up to 20% mass loss.</li>
    <li>Minimum distance from Earth will be 1.8 AU or 270 million kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet has been on a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin. As it approached the Sun, increased solar heat caused the comet to show signs of instability, leading to material ejections. Observations recorded emissions of carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, and nickel vapor, creating a greenish-blue glow around the comet.</p>

<p>As of October 30, 2025, experts have observed an elongated coma and rising surface temperatures, resulting in cracks and potential fragmentation of the core.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Rising solar temperature causes surface cracks in the core, leading to sudden material ejections,” experts noted, highlighting the comet's instability.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object visited, following 1I/Ê»Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous observations of 2I/Borisov showed similar outbursts resulting in smaller fragments, indicating a pattern in the behavior of interstellar comets under solar influence. The unique composition of 3I/ATLAS, including rare organic molecules, sets it apart from local Solar System comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After reaching peak heat on October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS is expected to dim as it moves away from the Sun, complicating ground observations until November. NASA and ESA will continue to analyze data in real time to monitor the comet’s behavior and potential fragmentation.</p>
