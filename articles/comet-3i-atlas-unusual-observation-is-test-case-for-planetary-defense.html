      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Unusual Observation is ‘Test Case’ For Planetary Defense</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has made an unusual observation of comet 3I/ATLAS using data from its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) spacecraft, marking a significant advancement in planetary defense efforts. The comet, which was first discovered on July 1, made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this observation.</p>

<p>This observation is important because it enhances the accuracy of predictions regarding the comet's trajectory. The ESA has stated that this approach provides valuable insights for monitoring asteroids and comets near Earth, even though 3I/ATLAS does not pose any danger. Richard Moissl, head of the Planetary Defence Office at the ESA, emphasized the coordination between agencies to ensure effective monitoring.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>During its closest phase, the comet passed approximately 29 million km from Mars on October 3.</li>
    <li>The ESA’s TGO conducted observations between October 1 and 7, 2023.</li>
    <li>Future visibility of the comet from Earth is expected in December 2023.</li>
    <li>ESA's Juice mission has also performed observations of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. The ESA's TGO began focused observations of the comet from its orbit around Mars between October 1 and 7. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, coming within approximately 29 million km. The closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 29. The comet is expected to be visible from Earth again in December 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“With no risk for Earth and several weeks available for preparation, it was possible to get all needed parties together in time to plan and schedule the observations without haste or risk to the space missions,” Richard Moissl, head of the Planetary Defence Office at the ESA, told Newsweek.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“By looking at the comet from a very different point in the solar system and combining them with the measurements taken from Earth, the knowledge about the position at a specific time can be significantly increased,” Moissl added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation represents the first time that astrometric measurements from a spacecraft orbiting another planet have been officially submitted to the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database. The ESA has been working on improving its monitoring capabilities for potentially threatening objects, and this exercise with 3I/ATLAS serves as a model for future efforts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ESA plans to continue observing comet 3I/ATLAS as long as it is visible, allowing for further study of its coma and composition. Additional measurements are scheduled with ESA’s Juice mission in the coming weeks, although data transmission rates may affect the timeline.</p>
