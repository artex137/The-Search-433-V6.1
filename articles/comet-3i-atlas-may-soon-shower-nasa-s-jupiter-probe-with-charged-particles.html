      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS May Soon Shower NASA’s Jupiter Probe with Charged Particles</h2>

<p>The Europa Clipper spacecraft may soon encounter charged particles from the ion tail of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, according to predictions from European researchers. This unique alignment between the spacecraft, the comet, and the sun is expected to occur between October 30 and November 6, 2023.</p>

<p>This event could provide important insights into the composition of 3I/ATLAS, which is considered an unusual comet. However, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown poses challenges for activating the spacecraft's instruments in time for the predicted measurements.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS perihelion: October 29, 2023, at a distance of 126 million miles (200 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper's distance from the sun: approximately 186 million miles (300 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Predicted observation window: October 30 to November 6, 2023</li>
    <li>Current status: Europa Clipper in cruise mode, many instruments inactive due to government shutdown</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>October 29, 2023: Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches its perihelion, coming closest to the sun.</p>
<p>October 30 to November 6, 2023: Expected alignment allows Europa Clipper to potentially sample charged particles from the comet's ion tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The ability to distinguish cometary ions based on their heavier composition, particularly water-group ions, could reveal significant differences between 3I/ATLAS and comets from our solar system,” said Samuel Grant from the Finnish Meteorological Institute.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as it is an interstellar comet, believed to be a time capsule formed billions of years ago. Comets typically develop two distinct tails: a dust tail that follows their trajectory and an ion tail formed by particles ejected into space as they approach the sun. The charged particles from the ion tail are propelled by solar wind, always pointing away from the sun. The Europa Clipper is designed to study Jupiter's environmental effects and is equipped to measure these charged particles.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>If the government shutdown continues, scientists may struggle to activate Europa Clipper in time for the predicted encounter with 3I/ATLAS. Future missions, including the European Space Agency's Comet Interceptor planned for 2029, aim to further enhance our understanding of cometary materials.</p>
