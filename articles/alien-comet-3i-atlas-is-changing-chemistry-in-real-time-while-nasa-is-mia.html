      <h2>Alien Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Changing Chemistry in Real Time While NASA Is MIA</h2>

<p>Santiago, Chile – The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is undergoing a significant chemical transformation as it moves through our solar system, with nickel gas giving way to iron. This unprecedented event is occurring while NASA remains sidelined due to the U.S. government shutdown.</p>

<p>The ongoing observations of comet 3I/ATLAS are crucial for understanding the formation of planetary systems. European observatories, particularly the Very Large Telescope (VLT) using the UVES spectrograph, are documenting the comet's evolving chemistry. Scientists have detected nickel (“Ni I”) emission lines from distances of 3.14 to 2.14 astronomical units (AU), while iron (Fe I) lines appear only after the comet crosses approximately 2.64 AU, marking a sudden and unique shift in the comet's composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently being observed from Santiago, Chile.</li>
    <li>Nickel gas is transitioning to iron gas as the comet approaches the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA is unable to participate in observations due to the U.S. government shutdown.</li>
    <li>Observations are conducted primarily by European teams at the Very Large Telescope.</li>
    <li>The distance at which nickel emissions are observed ranges from 3.14 to 2.14 AU.</li>
    <li>Iron emissions begin to appear once the comet reaches about 2.64 AU.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been traveling through the solar system, with significant observations made as it approaches the Sun. The comet has shown nickel emissions at varying distances, with iron emissions detected only after crossing a critical distance of 2.64 AU. This chemical shift is unprecedented and may provide valuable insights into cometary and interstellar chemistry.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to observe how a comet’s chemistry evolves under solar influence,” said a lead scientist involved in the study.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“American scientists are largely cut out of this cosmic moment,” noted another researcher, emphasizing the impact of the government shutdown on NASA’s capabilities.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The chemical shift observed in 3I/ATLAS is unprecedented in comet studies and may not occur again. Past observations of other comets have not reported such a dramatic transition from nickel to iron, making this event particularly significant for scientists studying the formation of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>European teams will continue to observe comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, with hopes of gathering more data before the comet moves out of reach. The shutdown of NASA's operations leaves American scientists unable to participate in this critical research phase.</p>
