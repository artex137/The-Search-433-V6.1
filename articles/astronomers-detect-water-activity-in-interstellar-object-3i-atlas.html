      <h2>Astronomers Detect Water Activity in Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected hydroxyl (OH) gas, a chemical fingerprint of water, from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS using the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope aboard NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The detection occurred during observations on July 31 and August 1, 2025, and again on August 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first time an interstellar comet has shown evidence of water activity at a distance where solar-system comets typically remain inactive. Authorities are now analyzing the findings to better understand the chemical and physical evolution of interstellar comets as they approach the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of discovery: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Observation dates: July 31, August 1, and August 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Water-loss rate: approximately 40 kg per second</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun during observation: nearly three times farther than Earth</li>
    <li>Lead researcher: Professor Dennis Bodewits, Auburn University</li>
    <li>Publication date of findings: September 30, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Following this, a global characterization campaign was initiated to study its brightness, morphology, and spectral properties. Observations conducted on July 31 and August 1, 2025, revealed hydroxyl gas, indicating water activity. Additional observations on August 19 confirmed the findings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Detecting water is a major breakthrough for understanding how interstellar comets evolve,” said Professor Dennis Bodewits. “It’s the chemical benchmark that anchors every comparison of volatile ices in a comet’s nucleus.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “When we detect water — or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH — from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” Bodewits added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Dr. Zexi Xing, a postdoctoral researcher at Auburn University. “‘Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn’t expect it.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This finding builds on previous discoveries of interstellar objects, including 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Each of these comets has provided unique insights into the chemical diversity of planetary systems beyond our own. The detection of water in 3I/ATLAS suggests that the building blocks of comets can vary dramatically between star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data gathered from 3I/ATLAS to further understand the implications of water activity in interstellar comets and how it relates to the chemistry of planetary systems across the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
