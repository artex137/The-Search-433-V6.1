      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS May Be A 10-Billion-Year-Old Time Capsule From An Earlier Age Of The Universe</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has tracked the path of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which was spotted on July 1 speeding through the Solar System at nearly twice the velocity of previous interstellar visitors. The object, confirmed to be an interstellar comet, has a suspected nucleus of approximately 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) and a potential mass exceeding 33 billion tons.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it could provide insights into the formation of early planetary systems in the galaxy and universe. The study aims to trace the origins of 3I/ATLAS, which may be around 10 billion years old, making it a potential time capsule of cosmic history.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Date spotted: July 1</li>
  <li>Velocity: Nearly twice that of previous interstellar visitors</li>
  <li>Nucleus size: Approximately 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles)</li>
  <li>Potential mass: Over 33 billion tons</li>
  <li>Time frame of trajectory tracing: 10 million years</li>
  <li>Close encounters identified: 93 nominal encounters, 62 significant</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, astronomers first observed 3I/ATLAS in the Solar System. The object was confirmed as an interstellar comet shortly after its detection. Astronomers utilized data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission to simulate the comet’s trajectory through 10 million years, attempting to identify its origins based on past encounters with other stars.</p>

<p>In their analysis, the team found that none of the 93 nominal encounters significantly altered the comet's trajectory, suggesting its current path may not be influenced by nearby stars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What makes 3I/ATLAS unique is that it allows us to study the evolution of objects originating from other stellar systems – something we had only theorised about until now,” said Pérez Couto, a researcher at the Centre for Research in Information and Communication Technologies and team leader.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Each observation is like opening a window into the Universe’s past,” Couto added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal but not yet peer-reviewed, contrasts with earlier hypotheses suggesting 3I/ATLAS might originate from the thick disk of the galaxy. The new findings indicate it likely comes from the galaxy's thin disk, aligning with the idea that it may have been ejected from a primordial planetesimal disk or an exo-Oort cloud.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further study of 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects is necessary to draw more definitive conclusions about their origins and significance in understanding the early universe.</p>
