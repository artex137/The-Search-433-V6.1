      <h2>3I/ATLAS Sparks Global Alarm: Truth Behind the Mysterious Interstellar Object Now Targeted by NASA and UN Teams</h2>

<p>A newly discovered interstellar object, named 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), has captured global attention after NASA confirmed it as the third known visitor from beyond our Solar System. The object was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study material from beyond the Solar System. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are coordinating efforts to track the object, which will reach its closest approach to the Sun on October 30 at approximately 1.4 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, and is expected to remain more than 1.8 AU from Earth, or about 270 million kilometres away.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>First spotted: July 1, 2025, in Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 1.8 AU (270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Nucleus size: under 5.6 kilometres wide</li>
    <li>CO₂ levels: unusually high, with low water-ice activity</li>
    <li>Estimated exit from the Solar System: early 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile first observed 3I/ATLAS. NASA confirmed its interstellar origin shortly after, noting its hyperbolic trajectory. Scientists have since monitored the object, with its closest approach to the Sun scheduled for October 30, 2025. NASA and ESA have coordinated to track the comet's path, and the JWST team plans to continue monitoring it after its solar perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The simplest explanation remains that it's a comet,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, addressing concerns about the object’s unusual characteristics.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tom Statler, a senior scientist at NASA's Planetary Science Division, stated, “It looks like a comet, it does comet things—the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows in the path of previous interstellar objects, such as ʻOumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019, which also passed through the Solar System. The arrival of these objects has raised interest in the potential for discovering more interstellar visitors, especially with new telescopes becoming available for research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and international observatories will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS until it leaves the Solar System in early 2026. The JWST plans to conduct further spectroscopic studies to gather more data about the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>
