      <h2>Alien, UFO or what? Mysterious lights leave cows ‘hypnotised’: Probe turns confidential due to national security</h2>

<p>On the night of August 14, residents in Candioti, a farming town in Argentina’s Santa Fe province, reported mysterious white lights with violet flashes hovering above a nearby field around 10 PM. Upon arrival, a police officer observed cows circling the lights as if hypnotised, while horses panicked and crashed into fences. The glowing object disappeared suddenly, leaving no trace or damage. Two months later, the case was classified by national security authorities.</p>

<p>This incident has raised concerns among locals, who are puzzled by the sudden classification of the event as a matter of national security. Authorities have sealed the police report, leading to speculation and curiosity about the nature of the lights and their implications.</p>
