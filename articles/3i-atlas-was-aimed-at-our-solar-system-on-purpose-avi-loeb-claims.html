      <h2>3I/Atlas Was 'Aimed' at Our Solar System on Purpose, Avi Loeb Claims</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, was spotted on July 1 by a telescope in Chile. Harvard theoretical physicist Professor Avi Loeb has suggested that its trajectory indicates it may have been intentionally directed towards Earth, raising questions among the scientific community.</p>

<p>This claim matters because it challenges the prevailing view that 3I/ATLAS is merely a natural phenomenon. Loeb argues that the object's unusual brightness and trajectory warrant further investigation into its origins. While most astronomers consider it a random comet, Loeb believes its characteristics suggest a more complex explanation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of discovery: July 1</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: Chile</li>
    <li>Potential size: Comparable to Manhattan Island</li>
    <li>Statistical rarity: Expected to appear once every 10,000 years</li>
    <li>Trajectory alignment probability: 1 in 500</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by a small telescope in Chile. Following its detection, Loeb analyzed its brightness and size, suggesting it could be significantly larger than previous interstellar objects. He also examined its trajectory and concluded that its alignment with the solar system's plane was statistically improbable, leading him to propose that it may have been deliberately aimed at Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object may have been aimed towards the inner solar system,” Loeb stated in a separate paper exploring the idea of an intentional trajectory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following 'Oumuamua and another unnamed object. The discovery of such objects has sparked renewed interest in studying interstellar visitors and their implications for understanding our universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further research is expected to explore the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory. Scientists will continue to debate its origins and whether it presents evidence of intentional design or remains a natural cosmic phenomenon.</p>
