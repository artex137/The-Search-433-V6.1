      <h2>From US to Australia, mysterious 3I/ATLAS spaceship pushes countries into urgent space-threat drills</h2>

<p>A wave of planetary defense drills has occurred worldwide in response to the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, with exercises taking place in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, South Korea, and Brazil. These drills have raised concerns among scientists and defense analysts due to their timing and scale, as officials maintain that such exercises are routine.</p>

<p>The urgency of these drills stems from the unpredictable behavior of 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited unusual characteristics such as anti-tail jets, strange pulsations, and persistent non-gravitational acceleration. Authorities are coordinating their efforts to enhance global planetary defense systems, with the European Space Agency leading the initiatives, followed closely by other nations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has displayed behavior that cannot be fully explained.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency conducted a three-day simulation involving mission control and ground-based observation networks.</li>
    <li>Japan executed a fast-tracked asteroid-impact exercise within two days of the ESA's simulation.</li>
    <li>The US Space Force moved a high-altitude orbital tracking drill originally set for late 2026 to an earlier date.</li>
    <li>Countries like Australia, South Korea, and Brazil also engaged in similar operations.</li>
    <li>Government sources indicate a political window for advancing defense technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The international response to 3I/ATLAS has unfolded as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The European Space Agency initiated a three-day planetary defense simulation.</li>
    <li>Japan followed with its asteroid-impact exercise, including civilian and military partners.</li>
    <li>The US Space Force expedited its orbital tracking drill, originally scheduled for late 2026.</li>
    <li>Other nations, including Australia, South Korea, and Brazil, joined in the defense drills.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behavior of 3I/ATLAS has raised eyebrows among scientists and defense analysts,” said a spokesperson from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This situation has created a rare political window for advancing technologies that usually encounter resistance,” noted a government source.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS has prompted a reevaluation of planetary defense strategies. Previous incidents involving unidentified celestial objects have led to calls for improved detection and monitoring systems. The current situation has spurred nations to collaborate more closely on defense initiatives.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the situation develops, governments are expected to continue enhancing their planetary defense capabilities. The International Asteroid Warning Network is integrating classified sensor intelligence to analyze non-standard hyperbolic bodies, with further drills anticipated in the coming months.</p>
