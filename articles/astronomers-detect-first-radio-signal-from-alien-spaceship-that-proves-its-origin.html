      <h2>Astronomers detect radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected radio signals from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it travels through our solar system. The signals were recorded on November 4, 2023, using South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope. There have been no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This discovery has raised discussions about the object's origins, with Harvard professor Avi Loeb suggesting it could be more than a naturally formed comet. NASA has dismissed claims of alien involvement but is under pressure to release high-resolution images of the comet, which is currently not visible from Earth. Experts expect to make renewed observations when the comet becomes visible in early December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Detection date: November 4, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: South Africa, MeerKAT radio telescope</li>
    <li>Surface temperature: approximately 7°C</li>
    <li>Diameter: up to six miles</li>
    <li>Expected visibility from Earth: early December 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS first appeared on astronomers' radars in July 2023. Since then, it has been the subject of significant scientific interest, especially regarding its potential origins. On November 4, astronomers recorded radio waves from the object, suggesting the presence of hydroxyl radicals, which indicate cometary activity.</p>
<p>The object reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, leading to a temporary disappearance behind the Sun and a change in color that has been noted by scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have to be open to other possibilities, such as an alien mothership,” said Avi Loeb, expressing concern over NASA's dismissal of alien theories.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The specific wavelength absorption is actually linked to the presence of hydroxyl radicals,” according to the Astronomer's Telegram report on the findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous observations of 3I/ATLAS have indicated the presence of water, with claims that water was being ejected from the comet. The latest findings suggest that solar radiation is breaking down this water, contributing to the formation of hydroxyl radicals.</p>
<p>This object is believed to be one of the oldest of its kind, potentially originating from an alien star system up to seven billion years ago.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has been urged to release high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS, but due to the ongoing government shutdown, those images have not yet been made available. Experts plan to conduct further observations when the comet becomes visible in December.</p>
