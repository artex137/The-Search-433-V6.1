      <h2>Harvard’s Avi Loeb softens stance on 3I/ATLAS, says comet ‘most likely natural’</h2>

<p>On December 20, 2025, Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> stated that the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> is most likely a natural body, softening his earlier speculation that it could be an alien probe. The comet passed its closest approach to Earth this week, approximately 170 million miles away, before continuing its trajectory out of the Solar System.</p>

<p>This clarification is significant as it reflects a shift in the scientific community's understanding of 3I/ATLAS, which has been characterized as an unusually large comet. Authorities and researchers are expected to continue studying the object to uncover more about its unique characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> December 20, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Cambridge, Massachusetts</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> 170 million miles from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Notable figures:</strong> Avi Loeb, Michio Kaku</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth this week, allowing scientists to observe the comet more closely. Loeb has since revised his earlier views regarding the object's origins, stating that it is most likely a natural comet rather than an alien artifact.</p>

<p>On December 20, 2025, Loeb appeared on Elizabeth Vargas Reports and discussed the comet's characteristics, noting its peculiarities and the need for further research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “So far, so good. 3I/ATLAS did not manoeuvre or display any unusual activity when it came closest to Earth.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb added, “At this point, given all the data that we have, I would agree that it’s most likely natural, but there are still a lot of things we don’t understand about it.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Michio Kaku highlighted the comet’s age, suggesting it could be as old as seven billion years, unlike most comets that are typically three to four billion years old.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community has been examining 3I/ATLAS since its discovery due to its unusual features and potential implications for our understanding of the cosmos. The idea that it could be an alien probe generated significant media attention and public interest. However, the consensus has shifted towards viewing it as a natural celestial body.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further studies on 3I/ATLAS to better understand its chemical makeup and the anomalies observed, as well as its implications for the study of other celestial bodies.</p>
