      <h2>Astrophysicist claims interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could have the power to create planets</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object moving through our solar system, and a new theory suggests it could assist in planet formation. This object, which entered from deep space and will eventually exit, exhibits unusual brightness and a rapid spin rate. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The implications of this discovery could reshape our understanding of planet formation. NASA has been asked to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun on October 31, 2023, amid concerns raised by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna and Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. NASA has dismissed any invasion threats associated with the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery of 3I/ATLAS announced in October 2023.</li>
    <li>Object is moving through the solar system and will pass the Sun on October 31, 2023.</li>
    <li>Research presented by professor Susanne Pfalzner at the Europlanet Science Congress.</li>
    <li>NASA has denied that 3I/ATLAS is an alien craft.</li>
    <li>Potential implications for understanding planet formation around massive stars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as it entered the solar system. Since its discovery, scientists have been analyzing its properties, leading to various theories about its nature and potential role in planet formation.</p>
<p>On October 31, 2023, 3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun, a moment that has prompted heightened interest from both scientists and the public.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects may be able to jump-start planet formation, in particular around higher-mass stars,” said professor Susanne Pfalzner. “Higher-mass stars are more efficient in capturing interstellar objects in their discs.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA has stated, “3I/ATLAS is simply a comet, not an alien mothership.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery comes amid ongoing research into the formation of planets. Typically, planet formation occurs through accretion, where small particles stick together over millions of years. However, recent findings suggest that captured interstellar bodies could provide a stable core for material to accumulate, thus accelerating the planet-building process.</p>
<p>NASA's recent announcement regarding potential biosignatures found by the Perseverance rover on Mars has also contributed to the excitement surrounding extraterrestrial research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, with scientists eager to gather more data on this unique interstellar object and its potential implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>
