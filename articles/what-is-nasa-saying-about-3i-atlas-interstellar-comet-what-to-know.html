      <h2>What is NASA saying about 3I/ATLAS interstellar comet? What to know</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered by the ATLAS telescope, is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. NASA officials have confirmed that the comet poses no danger to our planet.</p>

<p>This rare cosmic event has captured public interest and sparked speculation, including conspiracy theories suggesting it may be an alien spacecraft. NASA has actively dispelled these theories, emphasizing the comet's natural origins and the scientific significance of its journey through our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is projected for December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>Initial discovery occurred in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>NASA has released new images of the comet on November 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach speeds of up to 153,000 mph as it approaches the sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be visible with small telescopes until spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in July 2025. Initial observations indicated it was an unknown asteroid approaching Earth's orbit. Follow-up observations confirmed its interstellar origin and classified it as a comet.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2025, the comet came within 130 million miles of the sun, just inside the orbit of Mars. NASA released a series of images on November 19, showcasing the comet's characteristics and activity.</p>

<p>As it approaches its closest point to Earth in December, scientists continue to monitor its trajectory and speed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” said Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object discovered, following Comet Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. Its detection has reignited interest in the study of interstellar objects and their implications for understanding the universe.</p>

<p>The fascination with 3I/ATLAS has also been fueled by various conspiracy theories, notably one proposed by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, suggesting it could be an alien technology. However, NASA has maintained that the evidence supports its classification as a natural comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and eventually exits the solar system. The agency plans to provide updates on its trajectory and characteristics as new data becomes available.</p>
