      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS set for closest Earth approach in December</h2>

<p>Astronomy enthusiasts are preparing for the approach of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which will pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet, which has not been associated with any injuries or fatalities, offers a unique opportunity for scientists and skywatchers to observe a celestial object from beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third confirmed interstellar object in history. Experts say the approach provides a rare chance for observation and research. NASA is utilizing its real-time simulator, Eyes on the Solar System, to track the comet's trajectory, further engaging both the scientific community and the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass within 170 million miles of Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was first detected racing through space at a speed of 137,000 mph.</li>
    <li>It made a close pass of the Sun on October 30, 2025, coming within 130 million miles.</li>
    <li>The estimated size of the comet's nucleus ranges from 1,400 feet to 3.5 miles wide.</li>
    <li>NASA confirms it is visible in the pre-dawn sky through telescopes or high-end binoculars.</li>
    <li>The comet will remain observable through spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers confirmed that 3I/ATLAS originated outside our solar system. The comet was first detected as it travelled at a remarkable speed. Following this, it made a close pass of the Sun on October 30, 2025, before its upcoming approach to Earth.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet is expected to reach its nearest point to Earth, providing a significant opportunity for observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is an extraordinary chance to observe an object formed around another star,” said a NASA researcher. “These encounters are exceedingly rare in human history.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We certainly haven’t seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” stated Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, during a November press conference.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The appearance of 3I/ATLAS follows a growing interest in interstellar objects, highlighting their rarity and the scientific questions they pose. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have sparked considerable debate and interest among astronomers and the public alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor and study 3I/ATLAS leading up to its closest approach. Observations will provide valuable data on the chemistry and structure of interstellar comets, enhancing our understanding of these celestial phenomena.</p>
