      <h2>Brian Cox shuts down alien speculation around interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Brian Cox has rejected claims of alien involvement regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, detected by NASA on July 1, 2025. The comet is only the third known interstellar body to enter the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's discovery.</p>

<p>This debate highlights a clash between prominent scientists over the interpretation of 3I/ATLAS. While Avi Loeb from Harvard suggests the comet may be an artificial object created by advanced intelligence, Cox insists it is a natural phenomenon. The ongoing discussion reflects differing views on the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the importance of scientific evidence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected by NASA on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar body in the solar system.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims there is a 30 to 40 percent chance it is not a natural object.</li>
    <li>Loeb has assigned the object a 'four' on his “Loeb Scale” of extraterrestrial likelihood.</li>
    <li>Brian Cox emphasizes that the comet is entirely natural in origin.</li>
    <li>The comet is composed of carbon dioxide, water ice, and space dust.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA detected 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Following its discovery, scientists confirmed its interstellar origin, indicating it came from beyond the Sun's gravitational influence. Avi Loeb later published a paper proposing that the comet might be a technological artefact, sparking public interest and debate. In response, Brian Cox utilized social media to counter the speculative claims, asserting that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS is a comet… It is entirely natural in origin,” Brian Cox stated on X.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is a 30 to 40 percent chance this isn’t a natural object,” Avi Loeb told LADbible.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS mirrors previous discussions on interstellar objects, particularly regarding the implications of extraterrestrial life. Avi Loeb has often argued that the scientific community is too quick to dismiss the possibility of alien technology, while critics, including Cox, advocate for a focus on empirical data. This ongoing dialogue emphasizes the tension between speculative theories and established scientific principles.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory through the solar system, scientists will study the object further. Current research supports the conclusion that it is a comet, but the conversation about its nature and implications is likely to persist.</p>
