      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS grows visible tail in live Gemini images</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shown a visible tail for the first time, according to new images captured during a public educational session at the Gemini South observatory in Cerro Pachón, Chile on August 27. This development has reignited interest among astronomers regarding the object's classification as a comet.</p>

<p>The discovery indicates that 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting characteristics typical of comets, such as a broad coma and a tail that extends approximately 1/120th of a degree in the sky, pointing away from the Sun. Observations were made using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) as part of a public outreach initiative by NSF NOIRLab, aimed at connecting scientists with the public. This session also provided valuable data on the comet's spectrum, which can reveal information about its composition and behavior as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object travels at a speed of 60,000 km/second.</li>
    <li>The visible tail was first observed on August 27, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will approach Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>This is the third interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects include ʻOumuamua (2017) and Comet 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025, capturing the attention of astronomers due to its unusual trajectory, indicating it originated from outside the solar system. On August 27, 2023, during a public session at the Gemini South observatory, scientists observed the object developing a visible tail and coma.</p>
<p>As the object continues on its path, it is expected to come close to Mars on October 3, 2023, offering further opportunities for observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We were excited to see the growth of the tail, suggesting a change in the particles from the previous Gemini images, and we got our first glimpse of the chemistry from the spectrum,” said Karen Meech, astronomer at the University of Hawai‘i Institute for Astronomy, and leader of the program.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system, following the noteworthy discoveries of ʻOumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The presence of a tail and coma in 3I/ATLAS supports its classification as a comet, countering previous claims from some scientists, including Harvard's Avi Loeb, who suggested it could be an extraterrestrial spacecraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars and later the Sun. Data gathered from its spectrum will aid in understanding the object’s composition and changes as it travels through the solar system.</p>
