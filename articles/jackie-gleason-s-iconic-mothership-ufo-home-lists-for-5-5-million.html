      <h2>Jackie Gleason’s Iconic ‘Mothership’ UFO Home Lists for $5.5 Million</h2>

<p>Jackie Gleason’s famed estate, known as the Mothership, has hit the market for <strong>$5.5 million</strong> in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The circular home, designed by architect Robert Cika and completed in 1959, is a unique retreat that reflects Gleason’s fascination with UFOs and metaphysical theories.</p>

<p>The sale of the Mothership is significant due to its historical ties to the entertainment industry and its distinctive architectural style. The estate has previously attracted interest but has not sold since its last listing in 2018 for $12 million. The property is now listed with Corcoran’s Heidi Henshaw.</p>
