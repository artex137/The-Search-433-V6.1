      <h2>Alien comet 3I/ATLAS sweeps past Mars</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed just 30 million kilometres from Mars on October 3, 2025, after travelling through the inner solar system at speeds exceeding 200,000 kilometres per hour. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<p>The comet, discovered in early July, offers scientists a unique opportunity to study its composition and gain insights into the conditions surrounding the formation of its original star system. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have prepared their missions to capture images and data on the comet, which will soon be moving out of reach as it heads back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at over 200,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA missions aimed cameras at the comet during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to be visible from Earth in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>It will reach its brightest magnitude between October 30 and November 7, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered, marking its entry into the solar system. The comet has since travelled from near Jupiter's orbit and made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. During this time, multiple space missions have been monitoring the comet.</p>
<p>In late September and through most of October, 3I/ATLAS was obscured from view by the Sun. However, NASA's Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, along with ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, managed to capture images of the comet at its closest point to Mars.</p>
<p>As of now, the comet is anticipated to reappear in Earth's predawn sky by late October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS has not yet revealed itself in the Mars Express images, partly because these were taken with an exposure time of just 0.5 seconds,” the ESA stated in a press release on October 7.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Despite not being designed to capture something so far away, ExoMars TGO revealed the coma of gas and dust surrounding the icy-rocky nucleus,” the ESA explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is a rare visitor from interstellar space, providing a chance for astronomers to study its properties and learn about the environment from which it originated. As it moves away from the inner solar system, it will pass outside of Jupiter's orbit by March 2026, limiting the time available for observation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, official analyses from the NASA and ESA missions will be delayed. Observers are encouraged to prepare their telescopes for potential sightings of 3I/ATLAS in late October, when it may reach a brightness of up to magnitude 11.5, depending on conditions.</p>
