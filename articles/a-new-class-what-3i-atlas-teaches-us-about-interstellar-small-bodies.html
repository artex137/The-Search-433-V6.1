      <h2>'A new class': What 3I/ATLAS teaches us about interstellar small bodies</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has become the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our Solar System, following its discovery in 2023. Astronomers have identified its unique trajectory and composition, highlighting its origins beyond the Solar System. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to reshape our understanding of interstellar small bodies. According to astronomers, the discovery reinforces the notion that these objects are not rare occurrences but rather a common feature of the galaxy, with estimates suggesting trillions of such icy bodies may exist. Researchers are currently analyzing its chemical composition to gain insights into the formation of comets in extrasolar planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2023.</li>
<li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object after ‘Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
<li>The comet's trajectory indicates it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun.</li>
<li>Its chemical analysis shows a mix of H₂O, CO₂, CO, OCS, and trace nickel species.</li>
<li>3I/ATLAS has an eccentricity far above 1, confirming its interstellar origin.</li>
<li>The comet exhibits a low abundance of C₂ and C₃ molecules, indicating long-term exposure to radiation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Before 2017, astronomers had not identified any objects entering the Solar System from other stars. The discovery of ‘Oumuamua marked a significant breakthrough, followed by the identification of 2I/Borisov in 2019. In 2023, 3I/ATLAS was recognized as a new interstellar visitor, further confirming the existence of these celestial bodies.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS's trajectory has been shaped by gravitational encounters with other stars, distinguishing it from objects originating in the Oort Cloud. Its composition has been analyzed through spectroscopy, revealing significant chemical differences compared to previous interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar object is a sample from another solar system, delivered naturally to us,” said an astronomer involved in the study. “3I/ATLAS helps scientists refine models of comet formation in extrasolar environments.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discoveries of ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have set the stage for the analysis of interstellar bodies. These findings suggest that the galaxy may be populated with numerous icy comets, each offering a glimpse into the formation conditions of other planetary systems. The chemical diversity observed in 3I/ATLAS further supports the idea that these objects can vary greatly based on their origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to enhance their understanding of interstellar comets and their formation. Ongoing analysis aims to refine existing models of comet chemistry and structure in extrasolar environments.</p>
