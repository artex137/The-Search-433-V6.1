      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas’ speed of 57 km/s and hyperbolic route certify its interstellar origin</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is currently traveling through the Sistema Solar at a speed of 57 kilometers per second, confirming its interstellar origin as it follows a hyperbolic trajectory. This significant celestial event presents a unique opportunity for scientists to study materials from distant star systems.</p>

<p>The discovery of Comet 3I/Atlas marks a milestone as the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our cosmic environment. Researchers are utilizing this opportunity to gather data that could enhance our understanding of the dynamics of objects moving between stars. Observatories globally are tracking its route and predicting its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Speed: 57 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Trajectory: Hyperbolic, confirming interstellar origin</li>
    <li>Current status: Active observation by global observatories</li>
    <li>Significance: Third confirmed interstellar object</li>
    <li>Comparison: Faster than previous interstellar objects Oumuamua and Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has begun its journey through the Sistema Solar, reaching significant speeds that prevent it from being captured by solar gravity. The comet’s trajectory has been confirmed as hyperbolic, indicating it originated outside our solar system.</p>
<p>As it approaches the Sun, scientists are conducting precise calculations to predict its closest point, known as perihelion. The interaction with the Sun will last only a few weeks, after which the comet will continue its journey back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The study of 3I/Atlas provides crucial data for understanding the dynamics of objects moving between stars,” said a spokesperson from a leading astronomical observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/Atlas, the first interstellar object detected was Oumuamua in 2017, which exhibited unexpected acceleration attributed to water vapor emissions. The study of interstellar objects is essential for distinguishing their dynamics from those of solar system bodies, as they maintain velocities inherited from their galactic origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas and analyze its chemical composition through spectroscopic studies. These investigations aim to uncover more about the conditions in its home star system and contribute to our understanding of the universe’s chemical diversity.</p>
