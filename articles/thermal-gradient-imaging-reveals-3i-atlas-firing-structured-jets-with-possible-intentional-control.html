      <h2>Thermal-Gradient Imaging Reveals 3I/ATLAS Firing Structured Jets with Possible Intentional Control</h2>

<p>A new thermal-gradient image of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, captured on November 29, 2025, at 21:53 UTC in Rayong, Thailand, shows the object emitting jets that defy conventional comet physics, according to observer Teerasak Thaluang.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges established understandings of comet behavior and suggests that 3I/ATLAS may be exhibiting controlled actions. Authorities in the scientific community are now focused on analyzing the implications of these findings and what they may mean for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: November 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Rayong, Thailand</li>
    <li>Observer: Teerasak Thaluang</li>
    <li>Time of capture: 21:53 UTC</li>
    <li>Imaging technique: Larson–Sekanina filter</li>
    <li>Key phenomena observed: two collimated jets and a sunward anti-tail</li>
    <li>Next critical observation window: December 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The latest image of 3I/ATLAS was captured using a specialized filter that revealed structural details obscured by the coma. This image showed two distinct jets emerging in opposite directions and a sunward anti-tail, suggesting behaviors not typically associated with natural comets.</p>

<p>Previous observations of 3I/ATLAS have noted similar anomalies, including non-gravitational acceleration and periodic brightness changes, prompting scientists to consider the possibility of controlled propulsion mechanisms. The findings from the Thailand image add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the object does not behave like a typical comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist,</strong> noted that “the object’s pulsations cannot originate from rotation alone, because the nucleus is too small to produce brightness swings of tens of percent.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    Loeb further stated, “If the jet pulse direction remains stable rather than driven by the Sun, the mechanism is technological.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This latest imaging follows several observations from various locations, including Hawaii, Utah, Italy, and Spain, which have all reported unusual behaviors from 3I/ATLAS. The consistent pattern of structured jets and an anti-tail challenges the traditional view of cometary activity and raises questions about the object's nature.</p>

<p>The scientific community has been cautious in its interpretation, emphasizing the need for continued observation before drawing definitive conclusions about the object's purpose or origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, especially as it approaches its critical observation window on December 19, 2025. Further analysis of its jets and pulsations will be essential in determining whether the object is behaving like a natural phenomenon or exhibiting signs of intentional control.</p>
