      <h2>America's Most Renowned 'Prophet' Makes Startling Prediction About Alien 'Mothership'</h2>

<p>Brandon Biggs, a Christian pastor known for predicting the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, has shared a vision of an alien ship flying over the Vatican and Mayan temples in Mexico. Biggs revealed this vision in a YouTube video posted on October 15, 2025, claiming that a significant distraction is imminent, which will be visible across the ocean.</p>

<p>This prediction has sparked widespread interest and concern, as authorities and experts continue to monitor the object identified as 3I/ATLAS. NASA has stated that it is a comet and not an alien spacecraft, despite Biggs’ assertions that the object represents a threat from 'demonic spirits.'</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Who: Brandon Biggs, Christian pastor</li>
    <li>What: Vision of an alien mothership</li>
    <li>Where: Over the Vatican and Mayan temples in Mexico</li>
    <li>When: Vision shared on October 15, 2025</li>
    <li>Object in question: 3I/ATLAS, identified as a comet by NASA</li>
    <li>Upcoming event: 3I/ATLAS closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Biggs first shared his vision, claiming to see a mothership and smaller ships emerging from it. He indicated that this event would cause widespread fear and speculation about extraterrestrial life. His predictions gained traction after he accurately foresaw an assassination attempt on Trump in April 2025.</p>

<p>On October 15, 2025, Biggs reiterated his claims in a viral YouTube video, stating the vision was divinely inspired. He mentioned seeing 'demonic-looking lights' in the sky, which he believes will soon manifest.</p>

<p>NASA and other scientists have consistently maintained that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, set to make its closest approach to the sun later this month.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no such thing as aliens. You need to hear me. But there are going to be things in the sky that are going to scare everybody in the days ahead,” said Biggs in his video.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Matthew Genge, a planetary scientist from Imperial College London, stated, “Little green men certainly aren't responsible!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Biggs has gained notoriety for his previous predictions, including a warning about a shooting incident involving Trump. His recent vision about 3I/ATLAS aligns with ongoing discussions among scientists regarding the comet's nature, including speculation from Harvard Professor Avi Loeb about its potential origins.</p>

<p>Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be a technological mothership, a claim that has been met with skepticism from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the sun, scientists will closely monitor the object. The European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer will observe it on its closest approach. The results of these observations may clarify whether the comet disintegrates or behaves as theorized by some, including the possibility of releasing mini-probes.</p>
