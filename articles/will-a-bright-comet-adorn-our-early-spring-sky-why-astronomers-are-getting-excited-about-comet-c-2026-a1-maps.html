      <h2>Will a bright comet adorn our early spring sky? Why astronomers are getting excited about Comet C/2026 A1 (MAPS)</h2>

<p>A new comet, C/2026 A1 (MAPS), has been discovered by astronomers at the AMACS1 observatory in San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, on January 13, 2026. The comet is currently located approximately 191 million miles (308 million km) from the sun and shines faintly in the constellation of Colomba the Dove.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as C/2026 A1 (MAPS) belongs to the Kreutz group of comets, which are known for their potential to become bright objects as they approach the sun. Authorities and astronomers are monitoring the comet closely, as its trajectory and characteristics could provide insights into the behavior of similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2026 A1 (MAPS) discovered on January 13, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: AMACS1 observatory, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile</li>
    <li>Distance from the sun: 191 million miles (308 million km)</li>
    <li>Current magnitude: +17.8</li>
    <li>Affiliation: Kreutz comet family</li>
    <li>Pre-discovery image taken in December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 13, 2026, astronomers at the AMACS1 observatory discovered Comet C/2026 A1 (MAPS). The discovery was made using an 11-inch (0.28 meter) f/2.2 Schmidt telescope equipped with a CCD camera. Initial observations indicated that the comet was faint, with a magnitude of +17.8.</p>
<p>Subsequent observations confirmed that C/2026 A1 (MAPS) is a member of the Kreutz family of comets, which are known for their sun-grazing orbits. This discovery marks the first time a Kreutz comet has been identified so far from the sun, with a lead time of 11.5 weeks before reaching perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No inbound Kreutz comet has ever been discovered so far from the sun, with such a long lead time before reaching its closest point to the sun,” said a spokesperson from the AMACS1 observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Kreutz group of comets has a storied history, with origins tracing back to a large comet that fragmented centuries ago. Previous members of this group, such as the comets of 371 BC and 1106, have been documented in various historical sources, highlighting their significant brightness and visibility.</p>
<p>Since 1979, advancements in technology, including the use of coronagraphs on satellites like the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), have enabled astronomers to discover thousands of sungrazing comets, with over 3,500 identified as Kreutz sungrazers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet C/2026 A1 (MAPS) as it approaches the sun. Further observations will help determine its brightness and behavior, providing valuable data on the dynamics of Kreutz comets.</p>
