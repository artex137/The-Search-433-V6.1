      <h2>Vance: Will 'Get to the Bottom' of UFO Phenomenon</h2>

<p>Vice President JD Vance has expressed his interest in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during an appearance on Miranda Devine's "Pod Force One" podcast on October 30, 2025. Vance shared his thoughts on the topic alongside discussions about "spiritual forces" in the world, but did not disclose any specific incidents or sightings.</p>

<p>This discussion comes amid a broader interest in UFOs, particularly during the Trump administration. Authorities are examining the implications of unidentified aerial phenomena and the associated risks to national security. Vance stated he will "get to the bottom of this" in his future inquiries.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2025, the White House announced a task force to restore American airspace sovereignty, responding to concerns about unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and developing new drone detection technologies.

<p>On October 30, 2025, Vice President Vance discussed his UFO interest during a podcast, admitting to keeping an open mind about spiritual forces and the possibility of extraterrestrial existence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I'm a big believer that there are things out there that we can't explain. And so, if another person sees an alien, maybe I see an angel or a demon,” Vance said during the podcast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There's this crazy person inside me, and I'll put the tinfoil hat on from time to time,” he added, emphasizing his commitment to investigating the phenomenon.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in UFOs has grown significantly since the Trump administration's announcement of efforts to enhance airspace security. Previous discussions among government officials, including Secretary Rubio and Director Gabbard, have highlighted the need for transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
