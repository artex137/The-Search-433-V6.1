      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Know How Big Is The Interstellar Comet As It Approaches Closest To Earth On December 19</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will fly closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, with a minimum orbit intersection distance of 0.36 astronomical units (AU). The comet, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered on July 1, 2025. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This approach is significant as it marks the third interstellar visitor to the solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Authorities, including NASA and the Minor Planet Center (MPC), have monitored its trajectory and speed, which currently exceeds 61 km/s. The comet has been temporarily listed on the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP) while scientists confirm its trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>Date of discovery: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Minimum orbit intersection distance: 0.36 AU</li>
    <li>Current speed: 61 km/s</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size: Between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: Approximately 33 billion tons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. It reached its closest point to the sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.35 AU. The comet is expected to approach Earth on December 19, 2025, becoming a subject of interest for scientists and space enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, referred to the comet’s perihelion as a "black swan event" and noted that the comet exhibits several anomalies which could suggest it is more than just a comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the solar system has seen two other interstellar visitors: 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These events have heightened interest in the study of interstellar objects and their potential implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further studies will aim to confirm its trajectory and analyze its composition during its closest approach.</p>
