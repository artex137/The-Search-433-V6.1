      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery: Harvard Scientist Claims 'Wobbly' Comet Could Be an Alien Protection Craft</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, may be more than just a cosmic object. The comet, about 20-40 km across, passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 200 million km.</p>

<p>This discovery has sparked discussions among astronomers and the public about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb argues that its unusual features could indicate it is an engineered object rather than a natural comet. Authorities, including NASA and other scientific institutions, are analyzing data to better understand its behavior and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.35 AU (approximately 200 million km).</li>
    <li>The comet's diameter is estimated to be between 20-40 km.</li>
    <li>Hubble Telescope images from December 12 and 27 revealed a double jet structure.</li>
    <li>Loeb has identified at least eight anomalies in the comet's behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and entered the solar system on a hyperbolic trajectory. It reached its closest point to the sun (perihelion) on November 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 AU. On December 19, 2025, it passed Earth safely, prompting further observation and analysis.</p>

<p>In December 2025, Hubble images captured a double jet structure emerging from the comet, leading to renewed speculation about its nature. Loeb's analysis noted that the jets displayed unusual activity, suggesting a possible technological origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sunward jet might be utilized for protection against the solar wind, coronal mass ejections or sunlight,” said Loeb, emphasizing the possibility of advanced design.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Mainstream planetary scientists continue to favour a natural explanation,” noted NASA’s latest analysis, which attributes the comet's behavior to non-gravitational forces from asymmetric outgassing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar body to pass through the solar system, following &#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its behavior has been compared to these earlier objects, but it displays unique characteristics that have led to debates about its origins. Loeb's theories have attracted both support and criticism within the scientific community.</p>

<p>Previous discussions regarding interstellar objects have often revolved around natural phenomena, but the anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS have reignited interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers plan to conduct spectroscopic measurements of the jets' velocity profiles using major ground-based facilities like the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the Very Large Telescope in Chile. These observations are expected to clarify whether the comet's behavior aligns with natural processes or indicates advanced propulsion methods.</p>
