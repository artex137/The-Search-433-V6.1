      <h2>NASA detects anomalous structures on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS and sparks debate about their origin</h2>

<p>NASA has detected an anomaly in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on November 5, 2025, leading to intense discussions among astronomers about its composition and behavior. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, displayed an unprecedented inverted tail, known as an antitail, which disappeared shortly after, being replaced by a conventional tail measuring over 56,000 kilometers in length. The agency has confirmed that the comet will pass 270 million kilometers from Earth, posing no risk of impact.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it provides a unique opportunity to study materials from outside our solar system. Scientists have been closely monitoring the comet since it reached its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2025. The findings may lead to significant revisions in current astronomical models regarding cometary behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of anomaly detection: November 5, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed of the comet: 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Diameter of the comet's core: between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Next significant approach: March 2026, 50 million kilometers from Jupiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, calculations confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its origin is outside the solar system. On October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, its closest point to the sun. Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed bluish tones in the gas emissions, linked to carbon monoxide ionization. On November 3, NASA captured images of the antitail, which vanished by November 5, leading to the formation of a conventional tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The rapid transition of the comet's tail challenges conventional explanations based on gas sublimation," said a NASA spokesperson. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each of these objects has presented features that challenge existing astronomical models. The scientific community has noted the comet's unique characteristics, particularly its unusual acceleration and chemical composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, especially as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026. The gravitational influence of Jupiter could alter the comet's trajectory, providing additional data on gravitational interactions with high-speed objects.</p>
