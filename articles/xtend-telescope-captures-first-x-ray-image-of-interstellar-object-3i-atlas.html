      <h2>Xtend telescope captures first X-ray image of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The XRISM satellite's Xtend telescope has captured the first X-ray image of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, marking a significant milestone in astronomical observation. This detection provides initial insight into the behavior and composition of objects originating outside our solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it adds to the understanding of interstellar objects. Authorities, including the XRISM team, are analyzing the data to gather more information about the comet's characteristics and its interaction with the solar wind.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>Detection date: December 3, 2023</li>
    <li>Instrument: Xtend telescope onboard XRISM</li>
    <li>Developed by: ISAS/JAXA in collaboration with Japanese universities and research institutes</li>
    <li>X-ray emission observed: approximately 400,000 km around the comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1996, the first X-ray emissions from comets were documented with Comet Hyakutake. Subsequent observations confirmed this phenomenon in other comets. Despite these findings, the expected X-ray behavior of interstellar comets remained unobserved until the detection of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>Following the successful capture of the X-ray image, the XRISM team reconstructed comet-centered images from the data. They revealed faint X-ray emissions surrounding the comet, suggesting a diffuse cloud of gas emitting X-rays.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The emission observed could be the result of charge-exchange interactions between the gas released by comet 3I/ATLAS and the solar wind,” said a member of the XRISM team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this observation, attempts to detect X-rays from interstellar comets had been unsuccessful. The unique characteristics of interstellar comets, compared to their solar system counterparts, have been a subject of ongoing research.</p>

<p>The behavior of comets in the solar system has been documented, but understanding the properties of interstellar comets is still in its early stages.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The XRISM team will continue to improve data handling and analysis techniques. The initial findings are being used as a roadmap for future observations of interstellar comets and their interactions with the solar wind.</p>
