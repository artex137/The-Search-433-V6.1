      <h2>A Search For Coma In TESS Observations Of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Researchers have conducted a search for coma in the observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The study, which involved coadding over 9,000 images, was published in a report by IOP Science. No extended coma was detected in the images, indicating a lack of cometary activity as of the time of the study.</p>

<p>This research is significant because it helps clarify the activity levels of interstellar comets, specifically 3I/ATLAS. The findings suggest that while no extended coma was observed, the brightness of the comet might indicate the presence of coma in its central point-spread function. Scientists are now analyzing the implications of this data for understanding the comet's behavior and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study involved coadding over 9,000 TESS images.</li>
    <li>No extended coma detected in the observations.</li>
    <li>Brightness suggests possible coma presence in the central point-spread function.</li>
    <li>Dust ejection velocities, if sustained, are less than 10 m s<sup>−1</sup>.</li>
    <li>Published in a report by IOP Science.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The analysis began with the collection of data from TESS, where researchers coadded more than 9,000 images to investigate the comet's activity. The observations were compared to those of inactive objects, leading to the conclusion that no extended coma was detected.</p>
<p>Subsequent comparisons with data from the Hubble Space Telescope indicated that while there was no visible coma, the brightness could suggest some activity at the central point. Researchers have noted that if any activity occurred, it involved low-velocity dust ejection.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The radial profiles in both coadded groups are comparable to inactive objects, indicating that no extended coma was detected,” the researchers stated in their report.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study contributes to the broader understanding of interstellar comets and their characteristics. Previous observations of other comets have shown varying levels of activity, which can inform scientists about the formation and evolution of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue analyzing the data from TESS and Hubble to further understand the behavior of 3I/ATLAS and to refine their models of cometary activity.</p>
