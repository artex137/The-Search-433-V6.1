      <h2>Strange Video Emerges From US UAP Hearing</h2>

<p>On Tuesday, US Congress held a hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), where a video reportedly showing a missile hitting an unidentified object was presented. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the video.</p>

<p>This hearing is part of ongoing efforts by lawmakers to uncover information about UAPs and other government secrets. Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who led the hearing, emphasized the need for transparency regarding UAPs and other topics, stating that the federal government has concealed information from the public for decades.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: Tuesday, date not disclosed</li>
    <li>Location: US Congress</li>
    <li>Key figures: Representative Anna Paulina Luna, Representative Eric Burlison, U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins</li>
    <li>Video date: 30 October 2024</li>
    <li>Sources of video: Whistleblower, UAP journalist George Knapp</li>
    <li>Past incidents discussed: 2015 "Go Fast" video, USS Jackson sighting in 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the hearing, Representative Anna Paulina Luna opened with a statement about the need for truth and transparency regarding UAPs. She announced the formation of a bipartisan task force to investigate these phenomena, alongside other government secrets.</p>

<p>Representative Eric Burlison presented a video taken on 30 October 2024 by an American MQ-9 drone. The footage shows an orb off the coast of Yemen, which is reportedly struck by a missile from an unseen drone, yet appears unaffected.</p>

<p>U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins shared his account of witnessing a peculiar object while serving on the USS Jackson in 2023. He described a Tic Tac-shaped object that emerged from the ocean and accelerated rapidly without producing a sonic boom.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The federal government has been hiding information from Americans for decades. It is time to give Americans the answers they deserve.” - Representative Anna Paulina Luna</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That's a hellfire missile smacking into that UFO, and bouncing right off - and it kept going.” - George Knapp</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I’m not going to speculate what it is, but the question is why are we being blocked from this information?” - Representative Eric Burlison</blockquote>

<blockquote>“What I observed and what our crew recorded was not consistent with conventional aircraft or drones.” - Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing follows a series of discussions in Congress regarding UAPs and the government's response to sightings. The infamous "Go Fast" video from 2015 was previously investigated and deemed to depict a weather balloon, raising questions about the accuracy of various UAP reports.</p>

<p>Lawmakers are increasingly focused on transparency regarding UAPs, with further hearings planned to explore these phenomena and the implications for national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future hearings on UAPs are expected, as Congress aims to investigate further and potentially release more information to the public. The timeline for these developments is not disclosed.</p>
