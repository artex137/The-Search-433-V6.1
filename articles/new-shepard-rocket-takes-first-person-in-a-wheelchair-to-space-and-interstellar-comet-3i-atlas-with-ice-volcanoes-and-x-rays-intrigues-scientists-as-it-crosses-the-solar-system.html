      <h2>New Shepard rocket takes first person in a wheelchair to space, and interstellar comet 3I/Atlas intrigues scientists</h2>

<p>The New Shepard rocket from Blue Origin has launched its first passenger in a wheelchair, Micaela Benthouse, a German aerospace engineer, into space on Saturday at 11:17 a.m. Brasília time. At the same time, the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has passed through the solar system, raising hypotheses about ice volcanoes and unusual X-ray emissions.</p>

<p>This dual event highlights significant advancements in both space tourism and our understanding of celestial phenomena. Authorities are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics, as it is the third identified interstellar visitor to our solar system. Scientists are studying the comet to learn more about its origins and behavior, which may provide insights into the formation of distant regions in the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Launch time: 11:17 a.m. Brasília time</li>
    <li>Passenger: Micaela Benthouse, first person in a wheelchair to reach space</li>
    <li>Rocket: New Shepard, 16th suborbital flight by Blue Origin</li>
    <li>Comet: 3I/Atlas, discovered in July</li>
    <li>Comet's age: Estimated at 7 billion years</li>
    <li>NASA has officially dismissed claims of alien technology related to the comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The New Shepard rocket's launch was initially scheduled for Thursday but was postponed due to a pre-flight issue. The mission successfully lifted off on Saturday, marking a milestone in making space accessible to individuals with disabilities.</p>

<p>3I/Atlas has traveled through the solar system at high speed, following a hyperbolic trajectory that indicates it is not bound by the Sun's gravity. Initial studies have suggested that the comet may be older than the solar system itself, prompting interest from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The recent mission reinforces our goal to expand access to space tourism,” said Jake Mills, an engineer at Blue Origin. “The concept of who can go to space is changing.” 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The New Shepard rocket aims to make space tourism more inclusive, having previously accommodated passengers with hearing impairments. This launch demonstrates the ongoing efforts to broaden access to space experiences.</p>

<p>3I/Atlas's unique characteristics have sparked debate among scientists, especially regarding its composition and behavior. While initial reports speculated about alien technology, most experts have rejected these claims, focusing instead on its role in understanding interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor the comet as it travels through the solar system, gathering data that may enhance our understanding of interstellar objects. The Blue Origin team plans to further develop accessibility features for future space tourism missions.</p>
