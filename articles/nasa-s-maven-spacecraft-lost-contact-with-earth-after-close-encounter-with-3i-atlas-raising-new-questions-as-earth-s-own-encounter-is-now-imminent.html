      <h2>NASA’s MAVEN Spacecraft Loses Contact After Close Encounter with Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA’s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft has lost contact with Earth after operating normally in orbit around Mars, according to the agency. The loss of communication occurred in early December 2023, coinciding with the recent passage of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS through the Mars system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The unexpected communication failure has raised concerns within the scientific community. MAVEN is one of three orbiters monitoring Mars’ atmosphere, and its data is crucial for understanding the effects of solar radiation and space weather on the planet. NASA engineers are currently working to diagnose the issue and restore contact, but have yet to determine a definitive cause for the anomaly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Event:</strong> MAVEN spacecraft loses contact with Earth</li>
  <li><strong>Date:</strong> Early December 2023</li>
  <li><strong>Location:</strong> Mars orbit</li>
  <li><strong>Agency:</strong> NASA</li>
  <li><strong>Object of Interest:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early December 2023, NASA confirmed that MAVEN unexpectedly ceased communications with ground stations. The spacecraft had been operating normally prior to this incident. The timing coincides with the passage of 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object that is currently under scrutiny by scientists.</p>

<p>MAVEN is not designed to physically approach or interact with transient interstellar objects. However, it has provided significant data on various phenomena during its extended mission, including solar storms and energetic particle events.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Engineers are actively working to diagnose the anomaly and restore contact,” NASA stated regarding the MAVEN spacecraft.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The MAVEN spacecraft has been instrumental in monitoring Mars’ atmosphere and has contributed valuable data on unexpected phenomena. 3I/ATLAS is the most closely studied interstellar visitor since ‘Oumuamua, and its passage has heightened interest in the effects of interstellar objects on planetary atmospheres.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA engineers will continue efforts to restore contact with MAVEN and investigate the cause of the communication loss. Further updates are expected as the situation develops.</p>
