      <h2>Tracking 3I/ATLAS through space: How it compares to ‘Oumuamua</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, a newly detected comet, is being tracked by global telescopes after its discovery by the ATLAS telescope in Chile in July 2025. This object is notable for its size, speed, and active nature, making it a key subject for scientific study.</p>

<p>The comet is the third known object from outside our solar system, and scientists are closely monitoring it to uncover its mysterious origins and understand its unique characteristics. The comparison with ‘Oumuamua, the first interstellar visitor discovered in 2017, highlights the differences and significance of these celestial objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is approximately 10 kilometres wide.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> The comet travels at about 58 km/s.</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li><strong>Comet features:</strong> 3I/ATLAS has a bright coma and long tail, typical of comets.</li>
    <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> ‘Oumuamua was only a few hundred metres long and lacked a visible tail.</li>
    <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Monitored by NASA’s Hubble and ESA’s Mars Express, among other observatories.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile in July 2025. Since its discovery, it has been under continuous observation by a network of ground telescopes and space observatories.</p>
<p>As it approaches Mars and the Sun, scientists have observed its cometary activity, including gas jets and dust tails, indicating the presence of icy materials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is the brightest and largest known interstellar object so far,” said a spokesperson for the ATLAS project. “Its ongoing observations could uncover mysteries about its origin, evolution, and role in our cosmic environment.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, ‘Oumuamua was the first interstellar object detected, which sparked considerable interest due to its unusual shape and inert nature. The study of both objects contributes to a broader understanding of interstellar travel and the materials that may exist in deep space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it passes near Mars and the Sun, gathering data that may reveal insights into its composition and origins.</p>
