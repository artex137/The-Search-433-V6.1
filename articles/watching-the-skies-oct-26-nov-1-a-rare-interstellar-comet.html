      <h2>Watching the Skies: Oct. 26 – Nov. 1 | A Rare Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>BETHLEHEM, Pa. — A rare interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, is currently passing through our solar system, having been detected by an array of telescopes. The comet is not visible to the naked eye and poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it allows astronomers to study an object that does not follow a closed orbital path about the sun. Authorities are monitoring its trajectory closely, as it is expected to come within approximately 170 million miles of Earth later this year, which is still within the orbit of Mars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is classified as an interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>It was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently near its closest approach to the sun.</li>
    <li>NASA estimates it will pass within 170 million miles of Earth.</li>
    <li>It will not return to the solar system once it leaves.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope. Since then, astronomers have been tracking its path as it approaches the sun and moves through the solar system. Currently, it is nearing its closest approach to the sun, with its distance from Earth expected to be 170 million miles later this year.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It does not follow a closed orbital path about the sun,” said NASA regarding the classification of Comet 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of ongoing efforts by the ATLAS program, which aims to provide early warnings of potential collisions with Earth. This program was established following incidents like the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor explosion in Russia, which resulted in injuries due to breaking glass.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the solar system, gathering data and insights until it exits and does not return.</p>
