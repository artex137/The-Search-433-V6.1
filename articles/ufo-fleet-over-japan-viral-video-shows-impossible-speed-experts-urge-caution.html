      <h2>UFO Fleet Over Japan? Viral Video Shows 'Impossible' Speed, Experts Urge Caution</h2>

<p>A viral video claiming to show a fleet of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) streaking across Japan's night sky has sparked intense online debate. The video, posted earlier this week on social media platforms, shows multiple bright objects racing in formation before disappearing into the distance. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The Japanese government and Self-Defence Forces have not issued an official confirmation regarding the video. Experts caution that the footage likely depicts drones, aircraft, or optical illusions rather than extraterrestrial visitors. Analysts note that this incident aligns with a broader regional surge in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) reports across East Asia.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video posted on social media platforms, including X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube.</li>
    <li>Witnesses described lights as "faster than any jet" and "blinking in unison."</li>
    <li>No official confirmation from the Japanese government or Self-Defence Forces as of Friday.</li>
    <li>More than 80 Japanese lawmakers formed a parliamentary group in June 2024 to study UAPs.</li>
    <li>Japan's Self-Defence Forces are collaborating with US military officials on reporting protocols.</li>
    <li>Japan records hundreds of aerial anomalies each year, according to Popular Mechanics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Earlier this week, a video surfaced on social media, showing multiple bright objects in the night sky over Japan. Eyewitness accounts described the objects moving at incredible speeds, prompting widespread speculation about their origin.</p>

<p>In June 2024, Japan's parliamentary group was established to study UAPs, following a US Department of Defence report identifying East Asia as a hotspot for such sightings. This has heightened Japan's focus on investigating unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Leaving something unknown is a problem for national security,” said former Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada, emphasizing the need to understand potential foreign surveillance drones.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The combination of consumer-grade cameras, long exposure, and motion blur can easily make normal lights look like high-speed anomalies,” explained an aerospace researcher regarding the viral footage.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Japan has seen a growing interest in UAP and UFO research, spurred by both public fascination and official recognition of unexplained phenomena. The recent video highlights the challenges of distinguishing credible scientific evidence from viral misinformation.</p>

<p>Previously, Japan has detected suspected Chinese surveillance balloons and unregistered aircraft over its territory. This context raises questions about the nature of unidentified aerial sightings in the region.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Japan's Self-Defence Forces and civil aviation authorities will continue to assess the situation, including potential safety risks to commercial aircraft. Investigations into the viral video are ongoing, and analysts await further data from Japanese defence or weather agencies to confirm any sightings.</p>
