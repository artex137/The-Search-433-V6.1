      <h2>CIA says it will 'neither confirm nor deny' records on mysterious interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS—sparking new theories</h2>

<p>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has stated it will "neither confirm nor deny" the existence of records related to the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered in July 2025. This statement follows a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from ufologist John Greenewald Jr. for any assessments or reports referencing the comet.</p>

<p>This matter has garnered attention from astronomers and the public alike, particularly due to initial claims by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who suggested the comet could be alien technology. Despite scientific consensus classifying 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet, debates continue regarding its potential implications for national security and the nature of its origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb initially claimed it could be alien technology.</li>
    <li>The CIA's FOIA response did not confirm or deny records relating to 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Nasa has classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet of natural origin.</li>
    <li>Loeb has called for further investigation as the comet approaches Jupiter in March.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Avi Loeb proposed the idea that it could be an alien spacecraft due to its unusual size and orbit. In response to these claims, John Greenewald Jr. filed a FOIA request for CIA records regarding the comet. The CIA responded by stating it would "neither confirm nor deny" the existence of such records. As of now, NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet of natural origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb expressed his disappointment with NASA for not considering alternative possibilities, stating, "The ‘neither deny nor confirm’ response is the best way to keep the investigation of black swan events hidden from view."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb further stated, "Unless we check, we might never know if this swan is white or black."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This situation is not the first time claims of extraterrestrial technology have emerged. Previous incidents involving unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have sparked widespread debate and speculation. The classification of data related to 3I/ATLAS raises questions about transparency and the government's approach to potential threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter in March, astronomers and researchers will continue to investigate the comet's characteristics. Ongoing discussions regarding the CIA's classification of information may influence future inquiries into the object.</p>
