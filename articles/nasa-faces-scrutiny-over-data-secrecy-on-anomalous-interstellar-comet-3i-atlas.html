      <h2>NASA faces scrutiny over data secrecy on anomalous interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA is facing increasing pressure from scientists, campaigners, and U.S. lawmakers to release full observational data on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after the object exhibited unexpected behaviour during its closest approach to Earth last week, at a distance of approximately 267 million kilometres. This comet, the third confirmed object from interstellar space to enter the solar system, has prompted debates due to its unexplained trajectory changes and unusual physical features.</p>

<p>The scrutiny comes after astronomers reported that 3I/ATLAS deviated from its predicted orbit due to non-gravitational acceleration. Critics accuse NASA of lacking transparency, particularly regarding data that could enhance understanding of interstellar visitors and their interactions with the solar system. On 31 October 2025, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna formally requested specific data sets related to the comet, including images and measurements from various missions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on 21 December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has shown non-gravitational acceleration, indicating forces acting beyond gravity.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb calculated a radial acceleration of 1.1 × 10⁻⁶ astronomical units per day squared.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope network in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass within approximately 53 million kilometres of Jupiter on 16 March 2026.</li>
    <li>As of 27 December 2025, the comet was at magnitude 12 and fading.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the ATLAS telescope network in Chile first identified 3I/ATLAS. The comet approached Earth on 21 December 2025, prompting astronomers to report unusual trajectory changes. On 31 October 2025, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna requested data from NASA, leading to further scrutiny of the agency's transparency. Following a government shutdown, NASA released a set of images in November, which were criticized for their quality.</p>

<p>As the comet is set to pass near Jupiter on 16 March 2026, researchers warn that the opportunity to study it in detail is diminishing as it fades into deep space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,” said Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna in her request to NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb commented on the HiRISE image from 2 October, stating it amounted to little more than “a fuzzy ball of light” and criticized the quality of the data released by NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>NASA's data release policy states that data from taxpayer-funded missions should be made freely available through the Planetary Data System. A Change.org petition launched in November has gathered signatures urging NASA to release all raw and processed observations of 3I/ATLAS, citing the agency's commitment to open science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet continues to fade, the question remains whether NASA will release further, higher-quality data before it becomes too faint to analyze. Observations and investigations into the comet's unusual features are expected to continue as researchers seek additional insights.</p>
