      <h2>Italian observatory captures 3I/ATLAS’s bright tail under strong moonlight in 2025</h2>

<p>The Virtual Telescope Project in Italy has recorded an image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, on Monday, November 11, 2025. The comet was observed in Manciano, positioned 14 degrees above the eastern horizon, despite strong moonlight affecting visibility. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks continued global scientific interest in 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object from outside the Solar System. Astronomers have noted that the comet's elongated ionic tail remains visible even under a 61% lunar phase, with the Moon positioned 70 degrees away from the comet during the observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: November 11, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (269 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Initial discovery: July 1, 2025, in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Mass loss: Approximately 2 million tons from July to October 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. It was initially classified as an asteroid but confirmed as a comet on July 2 after observations revealed a coma and elongation. The Minor Planet Center assigned it the designation 3I, marking it as the third interstellar object.</p>

<p>The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, coming within 1.36 astronomical units of the Sun. Subsequent observations have shown a significant mass loss and changes in its surface due to cosmic radiation. The Virtual Telescope Project captured its ionic tail on November 11, 2025, utilizing robotic telescopes to combine multiple exposures.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The latest image from Italy’s Virtual Telescope Project has revealed something breathtaking — 3I/ATLAS glowing in the night sky with a massive, bright ion tail,” said a representative from the project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed after 1I/Ê»Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit and high velocity of over 58 km/s indicate an external origin, which has sparked interest in the scientific community. Previous observations have revealed significant changes to the comet's surface, including chemical compositions that suggest prolonged exposure to cosmic rays.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations are expected to continue as 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth. The comet will cross the ionic tail of Europa Clipper between October 30 and November 6, 2025. Astronomers predict it will be visible in small telescopes in November, with its brightness gradually fading into December.</p>
