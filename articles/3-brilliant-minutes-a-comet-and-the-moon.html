      <h2>3 BRILLIANT MINUTES: A comet and the moon</h2>

<p>GREEN BAY, Wis. — A new comet, named 3I/ATLAS, has been discovered entering our solar system. The comet was identified in July and is notable for being only the third object known to have originated from beyond our solar system. This event has sparked interest among astronomers and space agencies.</p>

<p>The discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study an object from outside our solar system. As it approaches the sun, researchers expect to gain insights into its composition and behavior. Meanwhile, NASA has announced plans for its Artemis 2 moonshot, which could launch as early as February, although the timeline for the Artemis 3 crewed moon landing has been pushed back past its initial 2027 target.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Only the third comet known to originate from beyond our solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA's Artemis 2 moonshot could launch in February 2026.</li>
    <li>Artemis 3 crewed moon landing is behind schedule.</li>
    <li>Two companies have been cited as responsible for the delays.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered Comet 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Since its discovery, scientists have been monitoring its trajectory and composition. In September 2025, NASA announced the potential launch date for the Artemis 2 mission, while also acknowledging delays in the Artemis 3 program.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have a visitor in our solar system,” said Brad, an astronomy educator. “This comet provides an exciting opportunity to learn more about the origins of such celestial objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of celestial objects that scientists are studying to understand the universe better. The delays in the Artemis 3 mission highlight ongoing challenges faced by NASA as it aims to return humans to the Moon.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue preparations for the Artemis 2 mission while addressing the delays affecting Artemis 3. Further updates on the comet's trajectory and insights from ongoing studies are expected as it approaches the sun.</p>
