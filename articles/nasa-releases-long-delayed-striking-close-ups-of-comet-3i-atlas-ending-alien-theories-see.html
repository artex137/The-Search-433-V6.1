      <h2>NASA releases long-delayed, striking close-ups of Comet 3I/ATLAS, ending ‘alien’ theories</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of comet 3I/ATLAS after a prolonged delay, showcasing the comet's unusual path and characteristics. The images were made public following a six-week shutdown in the U.S. that delayed the release of data collected since the comet's discovery on July 1, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant for scientists as 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA has utilized multiple spacecraft to capture detailed views of the comet, which provides rare material from another star system. Further observations are planned to gather more data from different angles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>The comet moves at a speed of 30,000 mph.</li>
    <li>NASA has employed twelve assets to gather images.</li>
    <li>The comet was last observed at a distance of 231–235 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>Images were captured by various missions, including Perseverance, MAVEN, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's missions have tracked comet 3I/ATLAS from its discovery to its current observations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>July 1, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered.</li>
    <li>September 11 to October 2, 2025: STEREO spacecraft followed the comet.</li>
    <li>October 2, 2025: HiRISE on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of the comet.</li>
    <li>October 4, 2025: Perseverance spacecraft obtained close-up images.</li>
    <li>October 9, 2025: MAVEN collected ultraviolet images.</li>
    <li>October 29, 2025: The comet brightened near perihelion.</li>
    <li>December 19, 2025: Comet will make its closest approach to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The inner Solar System acted like a large observatory during its passage,” NASA stated regarding the comet's observation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet holds carbon dioxide and water ice in large amounts,” a NASA scientist noted, emphasizing the significance of the comet’s composition.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable within the context of interstellar objects, being only the third such object observed in the Solar System. Its predecessors, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, sparked considerable scientific interest and speculation about the nature of interstellar visitors. The data from 3I/ATLAS may enhance understanding of the materials and conditions present in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS with additional spacecraft to gather more information about its composition and trajectory. Future observations are set to occur as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth in December.</p>
