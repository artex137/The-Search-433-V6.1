      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Alien Spaceship Theory is Dead—It Just Kept Cometing</h2>

<p>Speculation about comet 3I/ATLAS being an alien probe has been put to rest as the object has continued its trajectory through the Solar System. The comet passed its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, without any deviation from its expected path, according to the PUNCH mission's automatic tracking systems.</p>

<p>The failure of the comet to exhibit signs of artificiality is significant for astronomers. Theories suggesting that 3I/ATLAS could be an advanced spacecraft have been dismissed. Scientists are now focusing on the comet’s unique characteristics and the data it can provide about interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object tracked in our Solar System.</li>
    <li>The comet passed perihelion without any change in trajectory.</li>
    <li>It is currently located within the orbit of Mars.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency (ESA) plans to observe the comet from November 2 to 25, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be closest to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of 269 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Data from ESA’s JUICE mission is expected to be downloaded in February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed since its emergence from the Sun's glare by the PUNCH mission, a fleet of small satellites studying solar activity. The comet’s perihelion occurred recently, marking a critical moment for theories regarding its nature.</p>
<p>Following its perihelion, 3I/ATLAS has continued its journey, now heading out of the Solar System. Observations by ESA are planned for late November, with amateur astronomers set to have viewing opportunities in December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The alien spaceship theory, it seems, is dead,” said a representative of the PUNCH mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“JUICE will observe 3I/ATLAS between 2 and 25 November. We will be using five instruments... We are far away (0.5 Astronomical units), therefore, only remote sensing,” said Olivier Witasse, an ESA Project Scientist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Due to the position of JUICE with respect to Earth, the data rate is very low. We expect the data to be downloaded only in February 2026, so we need to be a bit patient,” Witasse added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object tracked in our Solar System, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS is noted for its high activity levels and potential ancient origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet continues its trajectory, scientists will gather and analyze data from both the PUNCH mission and ESA’s JUICE mission. Amateur astronomers can expect to observe 3I/ATLAS in December as it approaches Earth.</p>
