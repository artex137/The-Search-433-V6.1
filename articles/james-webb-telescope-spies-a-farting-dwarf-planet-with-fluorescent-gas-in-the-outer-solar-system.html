      <h2>James Webb telescope observes methane gas surrounding dwarf planet Makemake</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected faint traces of methane gas surrounding the dwarf planet Makemake, located in the outer reaches of the solar system, using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This discovery, reported in a study accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, marks only the second time gas has been detected on an object this far from Earth.</p>

<p>The findings suggest that Makemake, which orbits approximately 45 times farther from the sun than Earth, is more active than previously thought. Researchers aim to conduct follow-up observations to better understand the source and nature of the methane emissions, which may indicate geological activity on the dwarf planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dwarf planet Makemake measures approximately 890 miles (1,430 kilometers) across.</li>
    <li>Makemake is located about 45 astronomical units from the sun, in the Kuiper Belt.</li>
    <li>The study was uploaded to arXiv on September 8 and accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</li>
    <li>Temperature of the detected methane gas is approximately minus 387 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 233 degrees Celsius).</li>
    <li>Makemake was discovered in 2005 and has a small moon named MK2, measuring around 110 miles (175 kilometers) across.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2005, Makemake was discovered as part of the exploration of the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune filled with icy objects. Over the years, scientists have studied its surface, noting the presence of methane and ethane ice. On September 8, 2023, a new study utilizing JWST revealed faint concentrations of methane gas surrounding the dwarf planet, indicating potential geological activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Webb telescope has now revealed that methane is also present in the gas phase above the surface, a finding that makes Makemake even more fascinating,” said Silvia Protopapa, the study's lead author and researcher at the University of Maryland and the Southwest Research Institute in Texas.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, Pluto was the only known trans-Neptunian object to produce its own gas. Pluto's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen, with smaller amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. The dwarf planet Ceres, located in the asteroid belt, also exhibits a wispy atmosphere made of water vapor. These findings challenge the perception of Makemake as an inactive body in the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct follow-up observations using JWST to further investigate the source of the methane gas and its implications for the geological activity of Makemake. There are currently no planned missions to study Makemake or similar distant dwarf planets up-close.</p>
