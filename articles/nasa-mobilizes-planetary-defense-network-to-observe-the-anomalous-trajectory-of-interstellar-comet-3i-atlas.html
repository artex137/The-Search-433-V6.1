      <h2>NASA mobilizes planetary defense network to observe interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense teams to monitor interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile in July 2025. The activation, announced on December 30, 2025, follows unexpected changes in the comet's brightness and trajectory, although officials have stated there is no risk of collision with Earth.</p>

<p>This mobilization is significant as it serves as a crucial exercise to test global monitoring systems against celestial bodies with unpredictable characteristics. The data collected in the coming months will enhance planetary defense protocols for future threats, whether from solar or interstellar sources.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA announced the activation of its planetary defense network on December 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The observation campaign will run from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at speeds over 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits an unusual “antitail” and bursts of brightness.</li>
    <li>Initial reports indicate a 20% margin of error in position estimates due to the comet's activity.</li>
    <li>The observation involves collaboration with the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) and the European Space Agency (ESA).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile. Following its discovery, astronomers noted its unusual trajectory and brightness variations. On December 30, 2025, NASA announced the mobilization of its planetary defense teams to monitor the comet, marking the first time an interstellar object has been included in a formal simulation exercise.</p>
<p>The observation campaign began on November 27, 2025, and will continue until January 27, 2026, involving a global network of telescopes for continuous monitoring.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activation of our planetary defense protocol is a precautionary and training measure,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Our goal is to enhance our systems and ensure we are prepared for any future threats.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to be observed, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates it will not return to the solar system, making its study crucial for understanding the formation of celestial bodies outside our system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to gather data from the comet as it travels away from the solar system. The findings will inform future planetary defense strategies and improve tracking algorithms for similar celestial objects.</p>
