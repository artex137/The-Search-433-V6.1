      <h2>3I/Atlas Set to Pass Mars on October 3</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas will pass close to Mars on October 3, prompting space agencies worldwide to prepare their orbiters for observation. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This close encounter is significant for scientists studying the comet, which is the third interstellar visitor to our solar system. Space agencies, including NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and China's space agency, are gearing up to capture detailed images and data about 3I/Atlas as it approaches the red planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: October 3, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 29 million kilometres</li>
    <li>NASA spacecraft launched: 2005</li>
    <li>ESA orbiter Mars Express launched: 2003</li>
    <li>ESA orbiter ExoMars launched: nearly a decade ago</li>
    <li>China's Tianwen-1 mission launched: 2020</li>
    <li>Spatial resolution of HiRISE camera: 30 kilometres per pixel</li>
    <li>Estimated size of 3I/Atlas: approximately 1 kilometre (with some estimates up to 5 kilometres)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been on a trajectory toward Mars, with its closest approach scheduled for October 3, 2023. Space agencies have been actively preparing their orbiters to collect data and images during this event.</p>
<p>The HiRISE camera aboard NASA's orbiter is set to provide the clearest images of 3I/Atlas at a distance of 29 million kilometres. The ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars orbiters will also focus on the comet to gather additional information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The close approach of 3I/Atlas presents a unique opportunity for our instruments to gather data on this interstellar visitor,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are excited to use our spectrometers to measure the light spectrum from 3I/Atlas, which will help us understand its composition,” stated an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar comet confirmed to have entered our solar system. Its passage close to Mars is expected to provide valuable insights into the characteristics of interstellar objects. Previous observations of such comets have helped astronomers learn more about their origins and physical properties.</p>
<p>The scientific community is particularly interested in the tail of 3I/Atlas, which had not been detected for a long time. Recent images from the Gemini Telescope in Chile have shown the comet's tail, raising questions about its structure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the date approaches, space agencies will continue to prepare their instruments for the encounter with 3I/Atlas. Data collection and analysis will follow the close approach, with findings expected to contribute to ongoing research on interstellar objects.</p>
