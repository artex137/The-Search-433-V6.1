      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Green-Glowing Interstellar Visitor Nears Its Closest Earth Pass on Dec. 19, 2025</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, is currently passing through our solar system and will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet is approximately 1.8 astronomical units away, or about 270 million kilometres, which is nearly twice the distance between the Earth and the Sun. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This event is significant for scientists as it marks the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. NASA has stated that there is no danger to Earth from the comet. Researchers are closely monitoring the comet's activity, particularly its faint green glow caused by the interaction of sunlight with its icy nucleus, which releases gases and dust into its coma.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2025, at 1.8 astronomical units (270 million km).</li>
    <li>It was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope on July 1, 2025, from Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet's speed reached approximately 153,000 mph (246,000 km/h) at perihelion.</li>
    <li>New observations show a shift in color from red to faint green due to diatomic carbon emissions.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed there is no danger to Earth from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Subsequent observations revealed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is a one-time visitor from another star system. The comet reached perihelion in late October 2025, at which point it was closest to the Sun. As it continued its path, scientists noted a change in its color and monitored its interactions with the solar wind, culminating in its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "NASA says there is no danger to Earth," the agency stated in its current “quick facts” regarding the comet.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of two previous interstellar objects: 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of interstellar comets is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems beyond our own. The unique properties of 3I/ATLAS, including its chemical composition and behavior under solar influence, provide valuable insights into the materials present in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, researchers will continue to gather data from various observatories and spacecraft. The information collected will help scientists understand the comet's composition and the conditions in interstellar space, as this opportunity will not present itself again.</p>
