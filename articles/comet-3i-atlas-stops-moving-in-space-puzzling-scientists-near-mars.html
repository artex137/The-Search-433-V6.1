      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas stops moving in space, puzzling scientists near Mars</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has stopped its movement for several days near Mars' orbit, as detected by NASA equipment in October 2025. The comet, located approximately 27 million kilometers from Mars, has raised questions among scientists due to its unexpected behavior.</p>

<p>This phenomenon challenges existing laws of physics, particularly regarding hyperbolic trajectories. As researchers investigate the implications, they are revising celestial mechanics models to account for this anomalous event, which may indicate the presence of unknown forces affecting the comet's motion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas has halted movement near Mars' orbit.</li>
    <li>Detected approximately 27 million kilometers from Mars.</li>
    <li>The pause lasted several days in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Estimated to be about 10 billion years old.</li>
    <li>Next perihelion expected on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet will pass Venus in November 2025 and Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, the 3I/Atlas comet was observed to stop moving, a behavior not consistent with known orbital mechanics. NASA confirmed that there were no instrumental failures in the records.</p>
<p>Following the observation, scientists began analyzing spectroscopic data and noted subtle vibrations within the comet's nucleus. This has led to potential hypotheses regarding its interaction with magnetic fields or interstellar plasma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The event is a direct challenge to our current understanding of orbital theories,” said a NASA spokesperson. “The kinetic energy of the comet should have prevented any pause in its motion.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object to visit the Solar System. Its unique composition, including a high concentration of carbon dioxide and low water content, suggests it formed in a cold region of a distant stellar system. The discovery of metallic grains on its surface supports the idea of a complex internal structure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue studying the 3I/Atlas as it moves toward its perihelion. Further analysis of its chemical composition and behavior will contribute to understanding the forces at play and may lead to revisions in orbital simulation software to include non-gravitational interactions.</p>
