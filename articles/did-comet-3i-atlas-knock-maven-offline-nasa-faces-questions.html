      <h2>Did comet 3I/ATLAS knock MAVEN offline? NASA faces questions</h2>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has reported that its MAVEN spacecraft, which has been orbiting Mars since 2014, has gone offline following its close encounter with comet 3I/ATLAS on December 4, 2025. The spacecraft lost contact with all NASA ground stations after coming within 1,800 miles of the comet.</p>

<p>This incident raises concerns about the health of MAVEN and the potential impact of comet 3I/ATLAS on space operations. NASA has not yet reestablished communication with the probe, which recently reemerged within view of Earth. Scientists suspect that MAVEN may have altered its orbit, but without direct data, they cannot confirm this hypothesis. Experts have criticized the quality of images taken by MAVEN of 3I/ATLAS, which were released shortly before the spacecraft lost contact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>MAVEN went offline on December 4, 2025.</li>
    <li>The spacecraft was 1,800 miles from comet 3I/ATLAS during the encounter.</li>
    <li>MAVEN has been orbiting Mars since 2014.</li>
    <li>This is the first instance of MAVEN going dark.</li>
    <li>NASA has not reestablished contact with MAVEN since it lost communication.</li>
    <li>Images taken of 3I/ATLAS were criticized for their poor quality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 4, 2025, MAVEN approached comet 3I/ATLAS, coming within 1,800 miles of the celestial body. Shortly after this close encounter, MAVEN lost contact with NASA ground stations. The spacecraft subsequently passed behind Mars during its routine orbit. Recently, MAVEN reemerged within view of Earth, but attempts to communicate with it have been unsuccessful.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA is lying. 3I/ATLAS knocked MAVEN offline,” a social media user claimed, reflecting public frustration over the agency's information release.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this incident, MAVEN had experienced several technical issues but had not previously gone offline. The current situation has attracted attention due to the potential implications for future missions and the reliability of spacecraft during close encounters with celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to continue efforts to reestablish communication with MAVEN and assess the situation further. Investigations into the cause of the loss of contact and any potential changes to the spacecraft's orbit will also be carried out.</p>
