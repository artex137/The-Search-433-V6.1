      <h2>Extreme speed hinders direct mission to 3I/ATLAS; study proposes solar maneuver with Jupiter support and predicts interception only between 2070 and 2085</h2>

<p>A proposed space mission has studied how to intercept comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object identified, with an expected interception timeframe between 2070 and 2085. The study indicates that high speeds and the object's unusual orbit make a direct mission unfeasible.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it presents a rare opportunity to study material from outside the Solar System. Authorities are considering a flyby approach that would involve launching a spacecraft from Earth, using gravitational assistance from Jupiter, and employing a solar maneuver to gather data during a brief encounter with 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Mission launch window:</strong> 2035</li>
    <li><strong>Expected interception:</strong> 2070 to 2085</li>
    <li><strong>Flight duration:</strong> 35 to 50 years</li>
    <li><strong>Data collection method:</strong> Flyby</li>
    <li><strong>Key maneuvers:</strong> Oberth's solar maneuver</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2025, new images of 3I/ATLAS were obtained by the Nordic Optical Telescope, credited to researchers David Jewitt and Jane Luu. These observations assist in refining the object's trajectory and brightness characteristics.</p>
<p>The proposed mission aims for a launch from Earth in 2035, followed by a flyby of Jupiter, which will aid in redirecting the spacecraft toward the Sun. The spacecraft will then execute a critical engine burn to leverage the Oberth effect during the closest approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>The study calculates that, even with this approach, the mission will require careful timing to avoid a missed encounter with 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Even a compact set of instruments could capture unprecedented data on the composition, structure and activity of an interstellar object in accelerated passage,” the study authors stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides insights into the formation of planetary systems beyond our own. Previous interstellar objects have offered clues about their origins, and studying 3I/ATLAS could enhance understanding of the chemistry and behavior of such celestial bodies.</p>
<p>The mission poses challenges related to hardware reliability, team continuity, and sustained funding over many years due to its lengthy duration. Additionally, the extreme environment during the close flyby of the Sun requires the spacecraft to have a robust heat shield.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to refine the mission plan and trajectory calculations as more observational data becomes available. The scientific community views this proposed mission as a bold step toward understanding interstellar material, despite the long timelines involved.</p>
