      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas displays pulses of light every 16 hours as it approaches Earth in 2025, intriguing scientists</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has been observed exhibiting periodic variations in brightness as it approaches Earth, with the next significant event anticipated on December 19, 2025. The comet, which is currently about 274 million kilometers from Earth, has captured the attention of astronomers due to its unique behavior and composition.</p>

<p>This comet is classified as an interstellar object, having originated outside our solar system. The discovery of 3I/Atlas provides valuable insights into planetary formation in other stellar systems. NASA has intensified its observations of the comet and is collecting data to better understand its characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> Approximately 274 million kilometers (1.83 astronomical units)</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> June 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Apparent Magnitude:</strong> Between 8 and 9</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was first detected by the ATLAS system on June 1, 2025. Since then, scientists have observed its unique light pulses occurring every 16 hours. NASA has begun extensive monitoring of the comet, which is projected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, before continuing its journey out of the solar system.</p>

<p>After its closest approach, the comet is expected to leave the solar system by December 31, 2025. The comet's orbit is estimated to be over 800,000 years old, providing a glimpse into the conditions of the early solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The repetitive and regular nature of the comet’s light pulses raises complex questions about their composition and origin,” said a NASA spokesperson. “The data we are collecting will be crucial for understanding interstellar comets.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Astrophysicist Abraham Loeb from Harvard University noted, “The extreme periodicity observed makes it difficult to consider the phenomenon as purely natural. This raises the possibility that we are witnessing something beyond our current understanding.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Its unique chemical composition, which includes active volatile molecules like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, suggests it has preserved primordial material from a different stellar environment.</p>

<p>The comet's behavior has led to discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial technology, although NASA states there is no evidence to support this claim. The ongoing observations aim to deepen our understanding of the formation of interstellar comets and their role in the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa and ESA will continue to monitor comet 3I/Atlas in the coming months. There are also proposals for future missions that could intercept interstellar objects, aiming to obtain direct samples and further explore the characteristics of such celestial bodies.</p>
