      <h2>Interstellar comet passing by Mars seen in rare images</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar comet, known as 3I/ATLAS, has been photographed closely approaching Mars. The European Space Agency announced the images were taken on Friday, October 6, 2023, by two Mars orbiters as the comet was approximately 18,641,135 miles away from the planet. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The observation is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar comet to enter our solar system. NASA has stated that the comet poses no threat to Earth. Scientists are now analyzing the data from the Mars orbiters to gain further insights into the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Mars on October 6, 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars at time of observation: approximately 18,641,135 miles.</li>
    <li>Images captured by two Mars orbiters, including the CaSSIS camera.</li>
    <li>Comet visibility expected through September 2023, with closest approach to the sun in late October.</li>
    <li>Only two other interstellar comets have been confirmed: 1I/'Oumuamu in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency shared images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which captured the comet from about 277 million miles away. On October 6, the comet was photographed by two Mars orbiters during its approach to Mars.</p>

<p>NASA has indicated that the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October 2023, passing between Mars and Earth. It is expected to remain visible until it gets too close to the sun, reappearing on the opposite side in early December 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target,” said Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the CaSSIS camera.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are extremely rare, with only two other confirmed examples prior to 3I/ATLAS. The first, 1I/'Oumuamu, was discovered in 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such comets provides valuable information about the formation of solar systems and the dynamics of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from both Mars orbiters, combining multiple images from Mars Express in hopes of detecting the faint comet and gaining a better understanding of its properties.</p>
