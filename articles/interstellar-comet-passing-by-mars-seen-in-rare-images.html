      <h2>Interstellar comet passing by Mars seen in rare images</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, known as 3I/ATLAS, has been photographed as it closely approached Mars last week, according to the European Space Agency (ESA). The images were taken on Friday, when the comet was approximately 18,641,135 miles away from Mars. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar comet to enter our solar system. NASA has stated that the comet poses no threat to Earth. Scientists are currently analyzing data from Mars orbiters to better understand the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was photographed on Friday, during its approach to Mars.</li>
    <li>The comet was about 18,641,135 miles from Mars at the time of the images.</li>
    <li>This marks the third confirmed interstellar comet to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA has stated the comet poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to the sun in late October.</li>
    <li>It is expected to remain visible through September before moving too close to the sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. Early images were captured in August by the Hubble Space Telescope, showing the comet from about 277 million miles away. On Friday, images were taken by two Mars orbiters as the comet approached Mars.</p>
<p>NASA announced that the comet will make its closest approach to the sun between the orbits of Mars and Earth in late October. It is anticipated that the comet will reappear in early December after moving out of the sun's glare.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” said Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the CaSSIS camera. “The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are extremely rare, with only two others confirmed prior to 3I/ATLAS: 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These comets provide valuable insights into the formation of the solar system and the materials that exist beyond it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists from the European Space Agency will continue to analyze data from Mars orbiters, combining multiple images from Mars Express in hopes of detecting the faint comet as it moves through the solar system.</p>
