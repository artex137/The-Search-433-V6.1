      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS emits X-rays for the first time in history</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has emitted X-rays, marking a historic first for this celestial body, detected by the XRISM telescope between November 26 and 28, 2025. The observation confirms significant interaction between the solar wind and the comet's coma.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it enhances understanding of the chemical composition and behavior of interstellar objects. The XRISM mission, operated by JAXA in collaboration with ESA and NASA, has dedicated extensive resources to studying this comet. The detection of X-ray emissions will provide new insights into the processes that occur when solar wind interacts with comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected X-ray emissions between November 26 and 28, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observation conducted by the XRISM telescope, a collaboration between JAXA, ESA, and NASA.</li>
    <li>X-ray emissions confirm intense interaction between solar wind and the comet's coma.</li>
    <li>Comet's core diameter estimated to be greater than 20 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet will reach its closest distance to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet travels at a speed of about 60 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Data from XRISM will be presented at upcoming astronomical conferences.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between November 26 and 28, 2025, the XRISM telescope captured X-ray emissions from 3I/ATLAS. This detection followed a prolonged exposure of 17 hours dedicated to the comet. The emissions were characterized by a faint halo spanning approximately 400,000 kilometers around the comet's nucleus.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet is expected to reach its closest approach to Earth, drawing significant attention from astronomers and researchers worldwide.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The X-ray emission offers a new tool for studying the chemical composition of interstellar objects," said a spokesperson from the XRISM mission. "It helps compare chemical environments between different star systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This finding builds on prior research into the behavior of comets, particularly the mechanisms identified during the passage of comet Hyakutake in 1996. The current measurements from 3I/ATLAS expand knowledge about how the interstellar medium interacts with small celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from the comet and present preliminary results at astronomical conferences in the coming weeks. Ongoing observations will monitor variations in brightness and further investigate the comet's composition.</p>
