      <h2>Europa Clipper Reveals a New Perspective on Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper has observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its journey through the solar system, marking a unique opportunity for researchers. The observation occurred as 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, moving out of sight from Earth but within range of the spacecraft, which is en route to Jupiter.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it allows scientists to gather data on the comet's composition and the chemical processes occurring as it approaches the Sun. The Europa Clipper's instruments, particularly the Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS), are well-suited for this analysis, providing insights into the comet's two tails and their formation processes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently passing slightly inside Mars' orbit.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper is on a six-year mission to explore Jupiter's moon Europa.</li>
    <li>The Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) on Europa Clipper detects atomic and molecular transitions.</li>
    <li>Data from the observation is expected to be published within the next few months.</li>
    <li>The Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is also observing 3I/ATLAS from a different angle.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory mapped the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS shortly after its discovery. Within a week, the operational team of Europa Clipper recognized the spacecraft's unique vantage point for observing the comet.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS passed out of view from Earth, it remained observable by Europa Clipper, allowing for the collection of crucial data on its tails. JUICE, operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), also positioned itself to observe the comet at the same time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This extra observational time from these two space probes is honestly just lucky,” a NASA spokesperson said. “If they happened to be further on in their journey, they wouldn’t have such a front-row seat to this once-in-a-lifetime flyby.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is of particular interest due to its interstellar origin and its passage near the Sun for the first time in potentially billions of years. The observations from Europa Clipper and JUICE may provide insights into the chemical processes of the comet, contributing to a better understanding of the galaxy’s makeup.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will analyze the data collected from both Europa Clipper and JUICE. The findings are expected to be published in the coming months, contributing to ongoing studies of interstellar objects.</p>
