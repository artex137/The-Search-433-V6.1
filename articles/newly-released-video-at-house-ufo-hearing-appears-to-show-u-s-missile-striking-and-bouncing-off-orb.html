      <h2>Newly released video at House UFO hearing appears to show U.S. missile striking and bouncing off orb</h2>

<p>A newly-released video has captured a U.S. Hellfire missile striking an unidentified glowing orb off the coast of Yemen. The incident was highlighted during a House Oversight hearing on "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena" (UAP) on Tuesday, where Rep. Eric Burlison, a Republican from Missouri, presented the footage. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the event.</p>

<p>The significance of this video lies in its implications for national security and the ongoing investigation into UAP sightings. A recent government report indicated that the military received over 750 new UAP sightings between May 2023 and June 2024, prompting lawmakers to explore the potential threats these objects may pose. The U.S. military was conducting air strikes against Houthi targets at the time, but the specific mission related to the video has not been disclosed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video date: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Missile type: Hellfire missile</li>
    <li>Reported UAP sightings: Over 750 (May 2023 – June 2024)</li>
    <li>Hearing date: Tuesday, date not disclosed</li>
    <li>Representative presenting video: Eric Burlison</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a U.S. reaper drone captured video footage of a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen. During a House Oversight hearing on UAPs, Rep. Eric Burlison presented this video, which shows a Hellfire missile striking the orb and bouncing off it. The U.S. military was engaged in regular air strikes against Houthi targets in the region at this time.</p>

<p>In 2023, the U.S. Defense Department launched a website for declassified UAP information, following a House Oversight Committee hearing earlier that year. That hearing featured testimony from a former military intelligence officer and two former fighter pilots.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We've never seen a Hellfire missile hit a target and bounce off,” said Lue Elizondo, a former senior intelligence official with the Pentagon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When a Hellfire makes a hit, a kinetic strike on something solid, there's usually not much left of whatever it is it's hitting,” Elizondo added. “But in the video … what seems to happen is that the missile is either redirected, or in some case, perhaps glances off the object and continues on its way.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident occurs amid increasing scrutiny of UAP sightings, with a significant rise in reports over the last year. The U.S. military has been under pressure to investigate these phenomena, as they may pose threats to national security and aviation safety. The establishment of the Defense Department's website for declassified UAP information reflects a commitment to transparency in addressing these concerns.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident and the implications of the video are ongoing. The U.S. military has not commented further on the specifics of the mission or the details surrounding the second reaper drone that launched the missile.</p>
