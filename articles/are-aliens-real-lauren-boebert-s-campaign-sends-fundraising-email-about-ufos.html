      <h2>‘Are aliens real?’: Lauren Boebert’s campaign sends fundraising email about UFOs</h2>

<p>Representative Lauren Boebert, a Republican from Colorado, has sparked controversy after her re-election campaign sent a fundraising email on Monday claiming that the U.S. government has concealed information about UFOs. The email suggests that the American public deserves to know the truth about unidentified flying objects.</p>

<p>This campaign strategy has drawn attention amid the ongoing government shutdown, which has entered its second week. Critics argue that Boebert should focus on reopening the government rather than discussing UFOs, while supporters express interest in her stance on unexplained phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Campaign email sent on Monday, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Boebert is running for re-election in Colorado’s 4th Congressional District in 2026.</li>
    <li>The email claims the government has “shrouded the truth about UFOs.”</li>
    <li>Campaign confirmed the email's authenticity, stating it is “performing extremely well.”</li>
    <li>Government shutdown has lasted over one week as of Wednesday.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 2022, Boebert questioned experts during a House Oversight Committee hearing titled “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.”</p>
<p>On Monday, her campaign sent a fundraising email discussing UFOs and government secrecy. The email claims that strange crafts have been spotted and criticizes government officials for not being transparent.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, the government shutdown has continued, prompting discussions about Boebert's focus on UFOs during this critical time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For decades, our government has shrouded the truth about UFOs in a veil of secrecy,” the email reads. “I SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! The American people aren’t children to be spoon-fed half-truths or dismissed with vague excuses.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Democratic analyst Andy Boian stated, “The government is shut down, and there’s no opportunity right now to talk. So, what she needs to be doing is facilitating a way to get the government open again.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Colorado resident Morgan Vaughn expressed support, stating, “I agree with her. I think it’s time to get real about what could be happening.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first instance of Boebert questioning government knowledge of UFOs. She has previously made claims regarding the 2020 election results and has been involved in various controversies since her election to Congress. Her recent fundraising email has prompted mixed reactions, with some viewing it as a distraction from pressing governmental issues.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Boebert’s campaign will likely continue to focus on fundraising efforts and garnering support as she prepares for the 2026 election. The implications of her UFO claims and their impact on her political standing remain to be seen.</p>
