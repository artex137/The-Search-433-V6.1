      <h2>Avi Loeb Warns New 3I/ATLAS Behaviours May Signal Risks We Don't Yet Understand</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has raised concerns about the behaviour of comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traversing our solar system. In recent weeks, the comet has exhibited unusual characteristics that have puzzled astronomers, prompting a re-evaluation of its nature.</p>

<p>The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it challenges conventional understandings of comets. Authorities, including global telescope networks, are mobilising resources to monitor the comet's trajectory and behaviour closely. This effort aims to determine whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet or something more extraordinary.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently traversing the solar system.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has proposed raising the comet's Loeb Scale rating due to its anomalies.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits a consistent shape, unlike typical comets that change as they approach the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has shown 'clear spinning wave patterns' in its surrounding cloud.</li>
    <li>The comet has displayed a rare sun-facing 'anti-tail' at various times.</li>
    <li>Observations suggest a chemical signature rich in metals and depleted in iron.</li>
    <li>Scientists are using global telescope networks to monitor 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, astronomers have observed several anomalies in the behaviour of 3I/ATLAS. These include a consistent shape, unusual motion patterns, and unexpected chemical signatures. The comet's anti-tail and spinning wave patterns have also been documented, raising questions about its classification.</p>
<p>As these observations continue, scientists are working to gather more data to clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While none of these anomalies alone would definitively prove an artificial origin, together they paint a picture of an object that markedly departs from all known comets,” said Professor Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Should the non-gravitational acceleration continue to defy explanation by known physical processes, hypotheses involving artificial propulsion cannot be dismissed,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS is not an isolated incident. Previous interstellar objects have spurred similar discussions among astronomers about the nature of comets and other celestial bodies. The anomalies observed in 3I/ATLAS challenge existing models and prompt a re-evaluation of what constitutes a comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely over the coming weeks and months. Ongoing observations and analyses may provide further insights into whether this comet is simply an anomaly or indicative of more profound cosmic phenomena.</p>
