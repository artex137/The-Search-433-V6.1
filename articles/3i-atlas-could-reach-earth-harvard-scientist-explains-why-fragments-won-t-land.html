      <h2>3I/ATLAS Could Reach Earth? Harvard Scientist Explains Why Fragments Won't Land</h2>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has stated that the interstellar object known as Comet 3I/ATLAS, which passed approximately 269 million kilometres from Earth on 19 December 2025, is unlikely to deposit any significant debris into the planet's atmosphere. This event marks the third verified visit from an object beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>The potential arrival of cosmic debris from 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity for scientists to study material from a distant star system. However, experts monitoring its trajectory have confirmed that the distance at which it passed is too great for any substantial fragments to reach Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 269 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Number of verified interstellar visitors:</strong> Three</li>
    <li><strong>Potential materials detected:</strong> Traces of cyanide and hydrogen cyanide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 19 December 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to Earth, passing at a distance nearly double that of the Sun's separation from our planet. Initial scans revealed the presence of toxic chemicals in its atmosphere, raising concerns about potential hazards.</p>
<p>Loeb has clarified that the solar wind would prevent these substances from reaching Earth, as most vapours disperse within a much smaller range than the distance to our orbit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This stopping distance is an order of magnitude smaller than the 55 million kilometres defining the minimum distance between 3I/ATLAS and the circle marked by the Earth's orbit around the Sun,” said Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The closest among them will never get closer than ten times the Earth's radius,” Loeb noted regarding the larger fragments.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior interstellar visitors, such as 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, have provided crucial insights into the building blocks of foreign systems. Loeb's research into 3I/ATLAS aligns with ongoing efforts to understand these rare cosmic occurrences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar bodies to assess any potential risks. Loeb's findings suggest that no significant threats are anticipated from this comet or its fragments.</p>
