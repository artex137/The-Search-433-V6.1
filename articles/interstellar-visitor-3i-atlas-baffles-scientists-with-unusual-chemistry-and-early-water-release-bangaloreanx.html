      <h2>Interstellar Visitor 3I/ATLAS Baffles Scientists with Unusual Chemistry and Early Water Release</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) is puzzling astronomers with its unique carbon-rich chemistry and early water release as it transits through our solar system. The comet, which appears to have formed around another star, is being monitored by Mars orbiters, the European Space Agency's Hera, and NASA's Europa Clipper to gain insights into planet-forming materials beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it may help scientists understand the conditions under which materials formed outside our solar system. Observations have revealed that 3I/ATLAS is releasing water or hydroxyl ions earlier than expected, and its composition includes a high percentage of carbon dioxide, indicating a formation environment distinct from that of comets in our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is also known as C/2025 N1.</li>
    <li>It is currently being observed by Mars orbiters, ESA's Hera, and NASA's Europa Clipper.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is releasing water and metallic gases, including nickel.</li>
    <li>Observations have noted a lack of iron in the comet's coma.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to be closely monitored through November 2023.</li>
    <li>Data from ESA's JUICE spacecraft will reach scientists in February 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed since its discovery, with scientists focusing on its unusual chemical properties as it approaches the sun. The comet is currently being tracked by various spacecraft, including those orbiting Mars, which have directed cameras towards it during its flyby.</p>
<p>Between October 30 and November 6, NASA's Europa Clipper will pass through the tail of 3I/ATLAS, while ESA's JUICE spacecraft will fly close to it later in November. Data from JUICE will be transmitted back to Earth, but will not be available until February 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anomalies could be attributed to the fact that the comet may have formed around another star, where temperatures and radiation levels were different from those in our own system,” scientists stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Most scientists have negated the assumption that 3I/ATLAS is an artificial object, asserting that it is an interstellar object with a distinct composition,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This comet's discovery adds to a growing body of research on interstellar objects and their characteristics. Previous observations of interstellar visitors have provided insights into the materials and conditions found beyond our solar system, contributing to our understanding of the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. The upcoming observations from NASA and ESA missions will help unravel the comet's mysteries, with data from JUICE anticipated in February 2024.</p>
