      <h2>Alien Rumours End as Bengali Scientists Decode Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Bengali scientists have confirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is a natural object, dispelling recent speculation that it could be an alien spacecraft. The findings were published on January 2, 2026, by a team comprising Dr. Sabyasachi Pal from The Midnapore City College, Mr. Arijit Manna, and Dr. Tapas Bag from the Satyendra Nath Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it shifts the focus from speculation about extraterrestrial life to solid scientific understanding of the comet. The team used India’s upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to make the observations, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Detection dates:</strong> December 17 and 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Significance of detection:</strong> Greater than 10σ</li>
    <li><strong>Flux densities:</strong> 3.86 ± 0.38 millijanskys on December 17; 0.81 ± 0.05 millijanskys on December 19</li>
    <li><strong>Publication:</strong> Astronomer’s Telegram, January 2, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Speculation about the object being an alien spacecraft began shortly after.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa reported the first radio detection from 3I/ATLAS, observed when the comet was 3.76 degrees from the sun.</p>
<p>The Bengali team conducted low-frequency radio observations using the uGMRT on December 17 and 19, 2025, and confirmed the comet's natural status by analyzing the data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If an object were artificial or technological in nature, its radio emission would be expected to show specific patterns, signals, or anomalous features. These observations clearly demonstrate that the radio emission from 3I/ATLAS is entirely consistent with natural cometary behaviour,” said Dr. Sabyasachi Pal.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This research not only dispels misconceptions about 3I/ATLAS but also opens a new window for understanding future interstellar objects,” Dr. Pal added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected after 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Prior to this study, speculation about extraterrestrial life had been rampant, but no credible scientific evidence had supported these claims.</p>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS's radio emissions marks an important advancement in studying interstellar comets, moving the conversation from speculation to science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further research will focus on spectral line diagnostics and multi-epoch radio monitoring to better understand the comet's behavior and the processes involved. The team aims to prioritize follow-up observations and campaigns for future interstellar objects.</p>
