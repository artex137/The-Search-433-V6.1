      <h2>3I/ATLAS New Images Reveal Violent Jets: Is This Interstellar Visitor Really Natural?</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have revealed unexpected activity, prompting discussions about its nature. Astrophotographer Satoru Murata captured these images on 16 November 2025 using a 0.2-metre telescope in New Mexico. The images show multiple jets, including an anti-tail and a long, tightly collimated tail, indicating dynamic behavior from the comet.</p>

<p>This discovery has sparked a global debate about the true nature of 3I/ATLAS. Many observers are questioning whether the object is merely a comet or something more. The activity observed has led to public frustration with the scientific community's skepticism regarding extraterrestrial possibilities. Notable figures, such as scientist Avi Loeb, have been vocal in advocating for a broader consideration of these options.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of first images: 16 November 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observations: New Mexico</li>
    <li>Telescope used by Satoru Murata: 0.2-metre</li>
    <li>Telescope used by Francois Kugel: 0.4-metre</li>
    <li>Notable observers: Satoru Murata, Francois Kugel, Avi Loeb</li>
    <li>Public response: Increased interest and debate regarding the comet's nature</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 16 November 2025, Satoru Murata captured images of 3I/ATLAS that displayed multiple jets and dynamic behavior. The following day, Francois Kugel provided additional observations, enhancing the quality of data regarding the comet. These findings have led to a surge in public interest and debate about the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Just because something is unlikely, does not mean that it is impossible... Who's to say we don't see something impossible tomorrow?”</blockquote>
<p>— Kevin, software engineer</p>

<blockquote>“I love your honesty and passion for 3I/ATLAS. You have 100% of my respect.”</blockquote>
<p>— Leeann Grew, stay-at-home carer, UK</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS has attracted attention from both the scientific community and the public. Many individuals feel that traditional scientific perspectives dismiss possibilities that could lead to significant discoveries. This sentiment is echoed in various correspondences sent to Avi Loeb, who has encouraged open-minded discussions about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in 3I/ATLAS continues to grow, further observations and discussions are expected to take place in the scientific community. The debate about the comet's nature remains active, with many advocating for an open-minded approach to its study.</p>
