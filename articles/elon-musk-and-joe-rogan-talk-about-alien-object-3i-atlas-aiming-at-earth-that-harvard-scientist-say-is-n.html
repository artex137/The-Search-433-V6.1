      <h2>Elon Musk and Joe Rogan discuss Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>Elon Musk and Joe Rogan have engaged in a conversation about the interstellar object Comet 3I/ATLAS on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. The discussion took place recently, focusing on the comet's unusual characteristics and the implications of its potential extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<p>The conversation has sparked significant interest in the scientific community and among the public. Authorities, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have raised concerns about the comet's anomalous behavior and its proximity to Earth, as well as possible connections to NASA's data. Loeb has suggested that the comet may not be a natural object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The object is approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims the comet could be an alien probe.</li>
    <li>The comet is reportedly spouting four grams of nickel per second.</li>
    <li>Loeb has accused NASA of withholding information about the comet.</li>
    <li>Elon Musk publicly promised to reveal any evidence of extraterrestrial life on Rogan's show.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023. Speculation about its nature intensified after Loeb's claims regarding its possible alien origins and unusual characteristics. The discussion between Musk and Rogan occurred recently and has attracted media attention.</p>
<p>Loeb's accusations regarding NASA's transparency have further fueled public interest and scrutiny of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "It could be an alien probe sent to do recon on Earth."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Elon Musk said, "If I was aware of any evidence of aliens -- Joe, you have my word -- I will come on your show and I will reveal it on the show."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Musk also added, "I’m never committing suicide, to be clear. So, on camera, guys, I am never committing suicide ever!"</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions surrounding interstellar objects have often included speculation about their origins. The Tunguska event of 1908 serves as a historical reference point, as it involved a massive explosion attributed to an asteroid or comet, raising questions about the potential risks posed by such celestial bodies.</p>
<p>The ongoing advancements in space technology and astronomy have heightened public interest in objects like 3I/ATLAS, leading to increased scrutiny and debate among scientists and enthusiasts alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, further observations and analyses are expected from scientific communities and space agencies. Investigations into its composition and trajectory will continue, as will the public discourse surrounding its possible origins.</p>
