      <h2>Scientists to get closest look yet at mysterious object near Mars</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/Atlas will make its closest approach to Mars on Friday, coming within 18 million miles (29 million kilometres) of the Red Planet. The comet is traveling at a speed of 193,000 mph (310,000 kph) and poses no threat to Earth or any other planets.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study an interstellar object. A fleet of spacecraft, including satellites from the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, are preparing to observe the comet during its approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will pass within 18 million miles (29 million kilometres) of Mars.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at 193,000 mph (310,000 kph).</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object known to have entered the solar system.</li>
    <li>ESA's satellites have begun to observe the comet.</li>
    <li>Nasa's satellites and rovers are also prepared to contribute to observations.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to the sun is expected by the end of October.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth is predicted for December at 167 million miles (269 million kilometres).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2023. It is now on a trajectory that brings it close to Mars this Friday. ESA’s Juice spacecraft, which is currently en route to Jupiter, will continue observing the comet throughout November. The comet's closest point to the sun will occur by the end of October, followed by its closest approach to Earth in December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Both of the European Space Agency's satellites orbiting Mars have already begun training their cameras on the comet,” said a spokesperson from ESA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“NASA's satellites and rovers stationed on Mars are also prepared to contribute to the extensive observations,” an official from NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This close approach of 3I/Atlas marks a significant moment in the study of interstellar objects. Previous interstellar visitors have provided valuable insights into the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the close approach to Mars, ESA's Juice spacecraft will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas throughout November, while observations from NASA’s equipment will provide further data until the comet’s closest approach to Earth in December.</p>
