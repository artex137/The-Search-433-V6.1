      <h2>New interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS crosses solar system and anomalies spark debate about alien technology</h2>

<p>The global scientific community has mobilized since the detection of comet 3I/ATLAS in July 2025, marking its passage through the solar system. The comet, confirmed as the third interstellar object, reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at a distance of approximately 203 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study materials formed in a distant planetary environment. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are actively analyzing the comet's composition and trajectory, which has sparked discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial technology due to observed anomalies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of 58 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Closest approach occurred on October 29, 2025, at 1.36 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Analysis shows an abundance of carbon dioxide, water ice, and carbon monoxide.</li>
    <li>Comet exhibits non-gravitational accelerations attributed to gas ejection.</li>
    <li>Very Large Telescope (VLT) confirmed cometary nature in August 2025.</li>
    <li>Public debate about the comet's origin has intensified, especially regarding its anomalous features.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS telescope system in Chile detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Subsequent analysis confirmed its interstellar origin and trajectory, ruling out any local origin. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, allowing astronomers to collect data on its chemical composition and behavior.</p>

<p>In August 2025, the Very Large Telescope captured cyanide gas emissions from the comet, confirming its cometary nature. By October 2025, ESA refined its trajectory using data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, significantly reducing uncertainties.</p>

<p>NASA missions, including Psyche and Lucy, redirected their focus in September 2025 to gather images of the comet, contributing to the ongoing analysis of its ion tail and hydrogen coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, and there is no evidence to suggest an artificial origin or any type of threat,” said a NASA spokesperson in November 2025.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar visitors 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. 1I/ʻOumuamua sparked debates about its unusual shape and acceleration, leading to speculation about alien technology. In contrast, 2I/Borisov exhibited familiar cometary behavior and composition.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS presents a unique case, showing both cometary activity and atypical chemical characteristics, which have fueled renewed discussions about the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the constellations of Virgem and Leão in December 2025. Ongoing analysis aims to deepen understanding of its composition and trajectory.</p>
