      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Perihelion: Latest Developments</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor, reached perihelion on October 30, 2025. Observers worldwide have tracked this comet as it neared the Sun, although its proximity has made it difficult for terrestrial telescopes to capture clear images.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object to originate from outside the Solar System, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Scientists and astronomers are keenly studying this comet to gain insights into its composition and behavior, which may inform future research on similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately ten kilometers wide and contains volatile compounds like carbon dioxide (CO₂) and carbon monoxide (CO).</li>
    <li>The coma of the comet is primarily composed of CO₂ gas, with very few traces of water vapor.</li>
    <li>The comet follows a hyperbolic orbit and will not return to the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, when it appeared faint and slightly extended. Initial observations suggested the presence of an active coma, which was confirmed shortly thereafter. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, when it became obscured by the Sun as viewed from Earth. Data collection continued until it became unobservable.</p>

<p>During its approach, astronomers monitored non-gravitational accelerations due to jets of gas and dust escaping from the comet's surface. The Unistellar Network provided continuous brightness measurements, capturing unexpected fluctuations before 3I/ATLAS became obscured.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Each new discovery enhances future observational strategies, preparing scientists for subsequent encounters with interstellar visitors,” said Dr. Franck Marchis.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its interstellar origins but also for its unique chemical composition. Previous studies of Solar System comets have shown a different nickel-to-iron ratio, making this observation significant. The comet's unusual characteristics may derive from its formation in a different star system, altered by interstellar conditions over time.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves back into interstellar space, it is expected to fade from visibility. However, the data collected during its passage will support future missions, including the European Space Agency’s Comet Interceptor, which aims to study more interstellar objects in the future.</p>
