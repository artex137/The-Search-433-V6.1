      <h2>Expert says 'alien mothership' could drop 'technological device' in solar system</h2>

<p>Theoretical physicist Avi Loeb has stated that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may be an alien mothership capable of deploying technological devices on Jupiter. Loeb has indicated that the object is expected to reach its closest point to Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<p>This claim is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory. Loeb has pointed to anomalies he believes support his theory, suggesting that the object may have been fine-tuned to arrive within Jupiter’s gravitational influence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Relative speed of 3I/ATLAS to Jupiter: 65.9 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Current speed of 3I/ATLAS: 130,000 mph (approximately 209,215 kph)</li>
    <li>Number of anomalies supporting the theory: 12</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has outlined the following key events regarding 3I/ATLAS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar visitor.</li>
    <li>Loeb has published his findings on the object’s trajectory and potential capabilities.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, while obscured from Earth-based observatories.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS is technological in origin, it might have fine-tuned its trajectory with the help of thrusters so as to arrive at Jupiter’s Hill radius,” Loeb wrote in a blog post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If we find technological satellites of Jupiter that we did not send, it would imply that Jupiter is of interest to an extraterrestrial civilization,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community has debated the nature of 3I/ATLAS since its discovery. Many experts, including those at NASA, classify it as a comet. However, Loeb has consistently suggested alternative explanations, prompting further investigation into its characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, researchers will closely monitor its trajectory and any potential technological devices it may deploy. Further studies and observations are expected to clarify the object's nature and implications for extraterrestrial life.</p>
