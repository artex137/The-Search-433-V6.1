      <h2>Check out the interstellar comet that just whizzed past Mars</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, as two spacecraft in orbit around the planet captured images of the icy traveler. The comet passed within 30 million kilometres (19 million miles) of Mars, prompting observations by the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet, having originated from another solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, with its closest distance being about 273 million kilometres (170 million miles) away, on the opposite side of the sun. Observations of the comet are ongoing as researchers aim to gather more data and images.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet approached within 30 million kilometres (19 million miles) of Mars.</li>
    <li>NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System discovered the comet on July 1.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of 220,000 kilometres per hour (137,000 mph).</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter successfully captured images of the comet.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer will attempt to observe the comet in November.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System discovered comet 3I/ATLAS, which is moving too fast to be captured by the sun's gravity. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, during which both the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express attempted to photograph it. While the ExoMars orbiter succeeded, Mars Express faced challenges due to its shorter exposure times.</p>

<p>Following the comet's flyby, researchers are working to extract additional data from the images taken by Mars Express. The ExoMars orbiter's photos show a bright center surrounded by a glowing cloud of gas and dust, known as a coma, although the comet's nucleus and tail were not visible.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was a very challenging observation,” said Nick Thomas, who leads the ExoMars camera team. “The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is not part of the population of comets that orbit the sun. Instead, it is a true interstellar object, believed to have been expelled from its home system, possibly due to gravitational influence from a giant planet or star. Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar comets have been confirmed: 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>Recent studies suggest that 3I/ATLAS may have formed in an older region of the galaxy, making it potentially over 7 billion years old, nearly twice the age of our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft will attempt to observe 3I/ATLAS in November, when the comet is expected to be more active and visible with a brighter halo and tail.</p>
