      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Losing At Least Two Kangaroos' Worth Of Dust Every Second</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023, releasing significant amounts of dust and gases. Researchers David Jewitt and Jane Luu have tracked the comet's activity using the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands, and have noted its unique characteristics compared to other interstellar objects.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it sheds light on the behavior of interstellar comets and their properties. The research highlights the differences between Comet 3I/ATLAS and previous interstellar objects, such as Comet 2I/Borisov. Observations from July to September have provided insights into the comet's dust emissions, which are expected to peak as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will be 203 million kilometers (126 million miles) from the Sun on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is losing approximately 180 kilograms (397 pounds) of dust every second.</li>
    <li>This dust loss is equivalent to the weight of two kangaroos or about 11 corgis per second.</li>
    <li>Every hour, the comet releases dust weighing as much as six blue whales.</li>
    <li>In 20.4 hours, it releases enough dust to equal the weight of the Brooklyn Bridge.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is moving faster and has a more eccentric orbit than previous interstellar comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>From July to September 2023, researchers observed Comet 3I/ATLAS using the Nordic Optical Telescope. They confirmed the presence of an intriguing anti-tail and estimated the properties of the dust being released. As the comet approaches the Sun, it is expected to reach its peak activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS continues to be in a class of its own compared to previous interstellar objects,” said researcher David Jewitt. “Its dust emissions are significantly higher than those of Comet 2I/Borisov.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following Comet 1I/’Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. While Comet 2I/Borisov was releasing 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of dust at a similar distance from the Sun, Comet 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting much more vigorous activity. This difference underlines the variety of behaviors observed in interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS becomes visible in the skies, additional spacecraft will attempt to capture further observations over the next month. The findings from this research will be available for peer review and are currently accessible on arXiv.</p>
