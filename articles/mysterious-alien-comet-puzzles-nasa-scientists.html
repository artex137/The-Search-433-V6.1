      <h2>Mysterious 'alien' comet puzzles NASA scientists</h2>

<p>A team of NASA scientists has reported encountering an unusual comet, designated 3I ATLAS, which has sparked intrigue in the astronomical community. The comet was first detected in 2019 and has since been observed passing through our solar system, with its closest approach occurring on March 2, 2023.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because 3I ATLAS is classified as an interstellar object, suggesting it originated from outside our solar system. NASA has initiated further analysis to understand its composition and trajectory, which may provide insights into the formation of our solar system and beyond.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS was first detected in 2019.</li>
    <li>It made its closest approach to the Earth on March 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is classified as an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Nasa scientists are conducting further analysis of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS was initially detected in 2019 by astronomers using the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). After monitoring its trajectory, scientists confirmed its interstellar origin. The comet's closest approach to the Earth occurred on March 2, 2023, prompting heightened interest and study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unique characteristics of 3I ATLAS challenge our understanding of cometary bodies,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This analysis could reveal new information about the origins of such objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the discovery of 3I ATLAS, interstellar objects have been rare in astronomical observations. The first confirmed interstellar object, ‘Oumuamua, was detected in 2017, raising questions about the nature of such celestial bodies. The study of 3I ATLAS may help to establish patterns and characteristics that define interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa scientists will continue to analyze data from 3I ATLAS to better understand its composition and origins. Further observations are planned as the comet moves through our solar system.</p>
