      <h2>'Most remarkable anomaly yet' on 3I/ATLAS journey to Earth 'could prove it's alien tech'</h2>

<p>Theoretical physicist Avi Loeb has claimed that the comet known as 3I/ATLAS could exhibit a significant anomaly during its journey toward Earth, potentially indicating extraterrestrial technology. His comments come as the comet approaches its perihelion, the point at which it is closest to the Sun, prompting renewed interest and speculation about its origins.</p>

<p>This situation is critical as it has spurred discussions regarding the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the nature of celestial objects. NASA has previously addressed these speculations, stating that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, despite ongoing claims about potential alien contact by 2030.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently on a trajectory towards Earth.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has suggested it may release technological devices near Jupiter.</li>
    <li>The statistical likelihood of a significant anomaly is less than 0.00004.</li>
    <li>The anomaly may be observable in March 2024.</li>
    <li>NASA has categorized 3I/ATLAS as a comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as a comet, but speculation about its nature has grown since its discovery. In recent months, Loeb has proposed that the comet could be a spaceship. NASA held a press conference to address these claims, reasserting its classification as a comet. As the comet approaches its perihelion, Loeb has made further claims regarding its trajectory and potential anomalies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If the rare coincidence between the perijove distance of 3I/ATLAS and the Hill radius will materialize, it might flag a technological signature,” said Loeb in his latest blog.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader interest in unidentified celestial phenomena. Previous claims about potential alien technology have often been met with skepticism from the scientific community. NASA's stance has been to clarify the nature of such objects while acknowledging public curiosity and interest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues on its path, scientists are expected to monitor its trajectory closely. The potential for observing the alleged anomaly is set for March 2024, with further analysis to follow.</p>
