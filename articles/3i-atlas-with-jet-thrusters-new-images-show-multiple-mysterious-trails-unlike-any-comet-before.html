      <h2>3I/ATLAS with jet thrusters? New images show multiple mysterious trails unlike any comet before</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed a complex jet structure, capturing the attention of astronomers and scientists worldwide. The comet was observed at a separation of 29 degrees from the Sun, with notable images taken by comet observers M. Jäger, G. Rhemann, and E. Prosperi. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing understanding of comet behaviour. Monitoring agencies and telescopes globally have shared new images, leading to speculation regarding the comet's origins and its unusual characteristics. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has proposed that 3I/ATLAS may have experienced a blast near the Sun, which could explain its unexpected behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Recent observations show at least seven different jets emanating from the comet.</li>
    <li>Mass loss observed increased from 150 kilograms per second on August 6, 2025, to approximately 2 million kilograms per second near perihelion.</li>
    <li>The comet was observed at a separation of 29 degrees from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Images have been captured by astronomers M. Jäger, G. Rhemann, and E. Prosperi.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. On August 6, 2025, the Webb telescope recorded a mass loss of 150 kilograms per second. As the comet approached perihelion, observations indicated a dramatic increase in mass loss to about 2 million kilograms per second, suggesting the comet may have broken into fragments.</p>

<p>Recent images have shown complex jet structures, with the comet displaying unusual acceleration patterns and significant loss of mass. These developments have prompted scientists to reconsider the possibilities behind the comet's behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Was the dramatic mass loss and brightening of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion evidence that it disintegrated? Breakup into fragments would have increased the surface area of its material. This would mean that 3I/ATLAS exploded at perihelion and we are witnessing the resulting fireworks."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "The unusual jetting behaviors, 'at least seven directions' of jets, including sunward anti-tails, have only added to the intrigue." He speculated that these jets could be either natural outgassing or "thrusters used for navigation of a spacecraft."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has raised questions about the nature of comets and their interaction with solar phenomena. Past observations have typically shown comets exhibiting predictable patterns of behaviour, but 3I/ATLAS challenges these norms. The unusual acceleration patterns and mass loss observed are unlike typical cometary activity.</p>

<p>This incident follows other events where celestial bodies have exhibited unexpected behaviour, prompting further research into the physical processes behind these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to conduct further observations during Earth's closest approach to 3I/ATLAS in December 2025 to measure jet properties and determine the nature of the comet's behaviour.</p>
