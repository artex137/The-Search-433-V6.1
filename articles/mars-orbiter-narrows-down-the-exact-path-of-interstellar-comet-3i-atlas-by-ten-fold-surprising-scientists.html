      <h2>Mars orbiter narrows down the exact path of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS by 'ten-fold,' surprising scientists</h2>

<p>Scientists from the European Space Agency (ESA) have narrowed down the trajectory of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS significantly, using data from its recent flyby of Mars on October 3. The ESA has reported that the comet's path has been refined by ten-fold, enhancing future observation efforts.</p>

<p>This advancement allows researchers to make more accurate predictions about the comet's route as it travels out of the solar system. This refinement is crucial for astronomers aiming to study the comet's unique characteristics and origins in greater detail.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in early July 2023.</li>
  <li>The comet travels at over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
  <li>It came within 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) of Mars.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, at a distance of 168 million miles (270 million km).</li>
  <li>The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured detailed images of the comet during its flyby.</li>
  <li>Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS, pending public release due to a government shutdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object detected, was first observed in July 2023. On October 3, it made a close approach to Mars, allowing ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter to capture images and data that significantly improved predictions of its trajectory. Following its closest point to the sun on October 29, the comet reemerged from behind the sun relative to Earth.</p>

<p>Throughout its journey, 3I/ATLAS has experienced various phenomena, including an unexpected brightening event and a temporary color change. The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  "While the scientists initially anticipated a modest improvement, the result was an impressive ten-fold leap in accuracy, reducing the uncertainty of the object’s location," ESA representatives stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object ever detected. Previous interstellar objects have prompted interest in understanding their origins, which are often linked to far-off stars. The peculiar characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its highly irradiated surface and unusual anti-tail, have sparked discussions among astronomers, although claims of it being an alien spacecraft have been dismissed by the majority of experts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA plans to utilize its Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) to observe 3I/ATLAS later this month. Additionally, two other ESA spacecraft, Hera and Europa Clipper, are expected to pass through the comet's tail as it moves away from the sun, providing further opportunities for study.</p>
