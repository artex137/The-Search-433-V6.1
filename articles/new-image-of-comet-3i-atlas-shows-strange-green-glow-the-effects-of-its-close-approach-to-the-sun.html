      <h2>New image of comet 3I/ATLAS shows strange green glow, the effects of its close approach to the Sun</h2>

<p>A new image of comet 3I/ATLAS has been released, showing its green glow as observed by the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii on 26 November 2025. The comet, which made headlines in 2025 for being one of only three interstellar objects discovered, has changed significantly since its close approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is important for scientists studying interstellar objects and their behavior as they travel through our Solar System. The images are part of a public outreach initiative by the U.S. National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab, aimed at engaging the public in astronomical research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed on 26 November 2025.</li>
    <li>The images were captured using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph instrument.</li>
    <li>The comet appeared green due to light emitted by gases in its coma.</li>
    <li>Gemini North is located on Maunakea, Hawaii.</li>
    <li>This comet is one of only three interstellar objects ever discovered.</li>
    <li>Earlier images from the Gemini South telescope showed a red hue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2025 as it passed through our Solar System. It reemerged from behind the Sun in July 2025, prompting further observations. The latest images, captured on 26 November 2025, reveal how the comet has changed since its close approach to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Sharing an observing experience in some of the best conditions available gives the public a truly front-row view of our interstellar visitor,” said Bryce Bolin, a research scientist from Eureka Scientific. “Allowing the public to see what we do as astronomers and how we do it also helps demystify the scientific and data collection process, adding transparency to our study of this fascinating object.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for not orbiting the Sun like typical comets; it entered the Solar System from interstellar space and will exit it, disappearing from view. The comet's behavior and characteristics provide valuable insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists from the Gemini telescopes will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels out of our Solar System. They expect the comet to cool down, but some comets may show delayed reactions to solar heating, potentially leading to further outbursts of gases.</p>
