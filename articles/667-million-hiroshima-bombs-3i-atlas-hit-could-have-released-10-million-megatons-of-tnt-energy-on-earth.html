      <h2>'667 million Hiroshima bombs': 3I/ATLAS hit could have released 10 million megatons of TNT energy on Earth</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, a comet approximately 3 miles (5 km) in diameter, poses no threat to Earth today, but calculations indicate that if it were on a collision course, it could release energy equivalent to roughly <strong>667 million times</strong> that of the Hiroshima bomb. The comet is traveling at speeds exceeding <strong>100,000 mph</strong>.</p>

<p>This information highlights the potential risks associated with interstellar objects and has prompted researchers to study 3I/ATLAS for both scientific insights and planetary defence strategies. Current asteroid deflection methods are not designed for fast-moving objects like 3I/ATLAS, which makes the need for improved detection and defense systems critical.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 3 miles (5 km) in diameter.</li>
    <li>It travels at speeds over 100,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Energy release upon impact could equal 667 million Hiroshima bombs.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects include 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been identified as a significant interstellar object within our solar system. It has been studied for its unique trajectory and properties, offering a rare opportunity for scientific research. Researchers emphasize its potential risks and the need for enhanced planetary defence strategies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS shows that objects from interstellar space, even relatively small ones, could pose catastrophic regional risks if on a collision course,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its unusual trajectory and speed, which differ from typical asteroids. Previous studies of interstellar objects have led to increased awareness regarding the necessity of planetary defence initiatives.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers continue to study 3I/ATLAS to better understand its characteristics and implications for planetary defence. There is a call for investment in asteroid detection and global defence systems to prepare for potential cosmic threats.</p>
