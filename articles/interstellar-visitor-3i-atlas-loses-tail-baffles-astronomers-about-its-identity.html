      <h2>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS loses tail, baffles astronomers about its identity</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has lost its tail, raising questions about its identity as it moves through our solar system. Discovered on July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), this object has baffled astronomers worldwide with its changing shapes and colours.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it challenges existing theories about the nature of interstellar objects. Astronomers are currently divided on whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet or an artificial spacecraft. The ongoing debate highlights the need for further investigation into the object's characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Observatory:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Latest observation:</strong> November 5, 2023, from R. Naves Observatory, Spain</li>
    <li><strong>Notable claims:</strong> Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb suggests it may be an alien spacecraft</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's position:</strong> Likely a natural comet with unusual characteristics</li>
    <li><strong>Significant mass loss:</strong> 13% of its mass might need to be shed to explain movement</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2023, by ATLAS, a global network of telescopes. Since then, astronomers have observed its peculiar trajectory and rapid brightening. On November 5, 2023, new images from the R. Naves Observatory in Spain revealed that the object showed no signs of a cometary tail, which is typically expected when a comet approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the object's trajectory and characteristics, suggesting they might indicate artificial origins. Meanwhile, NASA scientists maintain that the observed features can be explained through natural processes, such as outgassing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "If 3I/ATLAS were a natural comet, its trajectory and rapid brightening would require it to shed 13% of its mass to explain its movement," said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The features of 3I/ATLAS can be explained naturally," stated a NASA representative, emphasizing the importance of further observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time astronomers have debated the nature of interstellar objects. Prior incidents, including the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017, have sparked similar discussions regarding their origins and characteristics. The scientific community continues to explore these objects to understand more about the formation of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Observations will focus on its composition and behaviour to determine whether it is a natural comet or something more unusual.</p>
