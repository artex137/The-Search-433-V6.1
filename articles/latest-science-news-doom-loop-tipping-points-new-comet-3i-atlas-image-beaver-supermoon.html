      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Becomes Visible Again Following Solar Passage</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has become visible from Earth again after passing behind the sun, with a new image captured on November 5, 2025, by the R. Naves Observatory in Begur, Spain. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the comet's visibility.</p>

<p>This sighting of Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it highlights ongoing research into interstellar objects and their characteristics. Scientists have noted that the comet has undergone transformations due to billions of years of space radiation, leading to speculation about its current state and behavior. Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have also contributed to understanding the comet's changes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS became visible again on November 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>The image was captured by the R. Naves Observatory in Begur, Spain.</li>
    <li>The comet has been transformed by billions of years of space radiation.</li>
    <li>Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed changes in the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 5, 2025, R. Naves Observatory in Begur, Spain, captured a new image of Comet 3I/ATLAS as it became visible from Earth after its passage behind the sun.</p>
<p>Prior to this, the comet had been obscured from view, making this sighting notable for astronomers and space enthusiasts alike.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The interstellar visitor has just become visible from Earth again after zooming behind the sun,” a statement from Live Science noted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are looking into the image today,” the report added, referencing ongoing interest in the comet's characteristics and behavior.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is categorized as an interstellar comet, having traveled from outside the solar system. Its previous visibility and transformations have made it a point of interest in astronomical studies, particularly concerning the impact of space radiation on celestial bodies.</p>
<p>This sighting follows a trend of increased interest and investigation into interstellar objects, sparked by advancements in telescope technology and observational capabilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS for further changes and behaviors as it remains visible to Earth-based observers. Additional studies and analyses are expected to follow as researchers gather more data on the comet.</p>
