      <h2>Comet Lemmon: A Once-in-a-Millennium Spectacle! How and When to Catch It Without a Telescope</h2>

<p>The comet C/2025 A6, known as Comet Lemmon, has begun to light up the night sky and will be visible from October 18 to November 12, 2025, with its closest approach to Earth occurring on the night of October 21. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this celestial event.</p>

<p>Comet Lemmon's appearance is significant as it passes through the inner solar system for the first time in a thousand years. Experts indicate that the comet could be seen with the naked eye, particularly in Mexico, and it may become a stunning sight in the coming weeks. Observers are encouraged to prepare for optimal viewing conditions.</p>
