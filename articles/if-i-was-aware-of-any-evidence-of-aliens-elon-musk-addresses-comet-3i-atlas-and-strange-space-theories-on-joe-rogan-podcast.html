      <h2>If I was aware of any evidence of aliens: Elon Musk addresses comet 3I/ATLAS and strange space theories on Joe Rogan podcast</h2>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk discussed the comet 3I/ATLAS during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which aired on [date not disclosed]. The Manhattan-sized comet has generated debate over whether it is a natural object or an alien probe. Musk stated he would reveal any evidence of extraterrestrial life if he were aware of it.</p>

<p>The conversation around 3I/ATLAS has intensified following its recent perihelion, where it came closest to the Sun, emitting gas and dust that caused a bright blue glow. Researchers are divided on its nature, with some asserting it is a natural comet, while others, like Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, theorize it could be an alien probe. Authorities and scientists continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and behavior closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered passing through the solar system.</li>
    <li>The object reached perihelion recently, releasing gas and dust.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently behind the Sun and is expected to be visible again in early December.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS exhibits both a tail and an anti-tail, prompting further investigation.</li>
    <li>Musk has publicly committed to revealing any evidence of aliens if he discovers it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), which is reflected in its name. The comet has been categorized as interstellar due to its hyperbolic orbital path, indicating it originates from deep space rather than our solar system. Recently, it reached its perihelion, creating significant interest among scientists and the public alike.</p>

<p>On [date not disclosed], Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience, where he spoke on various theories regarding the comet's nature and composition, including the potential for it to be an alien probe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I mean, one thing I can say is like, look, if I was aware of any evidence of aliens - Joe, you have my word - I will come on your show and I would reveal it on the show.” 
    — Elon Musk
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It’s fascinating, it’s fascinating also because it’s made almost entirely of nickel, whatever it is, and the only way that exists here is industrial alloys, apparently.” 
    — Joe Rogan
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There are definitely comets and asteroids that are made primarily of nickel… it doesn’t mean it’s a spaceship.” 
    — Elon Musk
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar objects such as ‘Oumuamua, which raised similar questions about extraterrestrial life. The ongoing research into 3I/ATLAS’s composition and behavior reflects a growing interest in the potential for life beyond Earth and the nature of objects originating from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. Its expected visibility in early December will provide new opportunities for study and analysis, while Musk's commitment to disclose any alien evidence will keep public interest high.</p>
