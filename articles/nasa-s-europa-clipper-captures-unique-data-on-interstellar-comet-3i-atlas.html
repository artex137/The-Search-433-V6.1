      <h2>NASA’s Europa Clipper Captures Unique Data on Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft has gathered significant data on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using its Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS), developed by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). The data collection occurred during November 2023, when visibility from Earth and Mars was limited due to the comet's proximity to the Sun.</p>

<p>This observation is important as it provides a unique opportunity to study the comet's composition and behavior, bridging gaps in data from previous observations. The Europa Clipper team, recognizing the mission's potential, has aimed to enhance understanding of not only 3I/ATLAS but also broader processes of comet formation and evolution in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS confirmed as the third interstellar object recorded in the solar system.</li>
    <li>Observations made by the Europa Clipper in November 2023.</li>
    <li>Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) instrument developed by SwRI.</li>
    <li>Data includes signatures of oxygen, hydrogen, and dust from the comet.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper launched in 2024, expected to arrive at Jupiter in 2030.</li>
    <li>49 planned close flybys of Europa to analyze atmospheric gases and surface materials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, 3I/ATLAS was confirmed as an interstellar object entering the solar system. Shortly after its discovery, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) plotted its trajectory. In November 2023, the Europa Clipper successfully captured data on the comet during a unique observational window.</p>

<p>The spacecraft's positioning allowed it to view the comet from a "behind the tails" angle, crucial for understanding its dual tails—one dust tail trailing behind and a plasma tail directed away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our observations have allowed for a unique and nuanced view of the comet,” said Dr. Kurt Retherford, principal investigator for Europa-UVS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We can see gases come off the comet, and water molecules break apart into hydrogen and oxygen atoms,” Dr. Retherford added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“What are the chemical processes at play, and how can we unravel the comet's origin in its own star system?” asked Dr. Tracy Becker, co-deputy principal investigator of Europa-UVS. “Those are big questions.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation builds on prior research into interstellar comets, offering insights into their characteristics and origins. The collaboration with the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) aims to provide a comprehensive view of the comet's tail geometries, enhancing data from previous Earth-based observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing research will continue to analyze the data collected by the Europa Clipper and JUICE missions, with hopes of answering fundamental questions about the composition of 3I/ATLAS and the processes behind comet formation across the galaxy.</p>
