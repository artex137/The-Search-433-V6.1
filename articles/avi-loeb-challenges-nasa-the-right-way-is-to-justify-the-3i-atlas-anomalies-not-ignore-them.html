      <h2>Avi Loeb challenges NASA: "The right way is to justify the 3I/ATLAS anomalies, not ignore them"</h2>

<p>Harvard professor <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has publicly challenged NASA regarding the interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, asserting that the agency should not dismiss the anomalies surrounding its nature. Loeb has proposed that the comet may have an artificial origin rather than being a natural celestial body, as NASA claims. His comments come amid ongoing debates in the scientific community about the object's true nature.</p>

<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS is significant because it raises questions about humanity's understanding of interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial technology. In response to Loeb's assertions, NASA has maintained that 3I/ATLAS is simply a comet, which is the third interstellar object discovered by humanity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Claimed Origin:</strong> Possible artificial object, according to Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's Position:</strong> Identifies it as a comet</li>
    <li><strong>Probability of Specific Trajectory:</strong> 1 in 26,000</li>
    <li><strong>Loeb's Affiliation:</strong> Harvard University</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has sparked debate in the scientific community. Loeb has published articles outlining his theories about the object, suggesting it may be a spacecraft potentially heading to Jupiter's orbit. NASA has consistently maintained its position that the comet is a natural phenomenon.</p>

<p>Loeb has taken to various media platforms to express his views, emphasizing the importance of investigating the anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS rather than ignoring them. His statements have attracted attention and have prompted discussions about the role of academia in reporting scientific findings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The correct way to approach alternative interpretations of 3I/ATLAS is by justifying the anomalies, not ignoring them,” said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “After the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, I chose the alternative way of communicating the scientific process as an opportunity to explore the exciting possibility that it was a technological object, based on its anomalies,” he added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discourse around 3I/ATLAS reflects broader trends in the scientific community concerning the interpretation of unusual astronomical phenomena. Loeb's perspective highlights a growing interest in exploring non-traditional explanations for celestial objects, which may challenge established scientific norms.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the debate continues, Loeb's challenge to NASA may prompt further investigation into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. The scientific community is likely to engage in ongoing discussions regarding the implications of his theories and the necessity for transparency in scientific reporting.</p>
