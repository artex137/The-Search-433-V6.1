      <h2>3I/ATLAS Alien Signal: NASA Reveals Comet Is Just Water Vapour, Not A Message</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, officially designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), has sparked speculation about extraterrestrial signals as it approaches Earth, but NASA has confirmed that it is simply emitting water vapour. The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</p>

<p>This clarification matters because it addresses the public's curiosity and concerns surrounding the comet's unusual activity. The scientific community has emphasized that the radio signals detected are due to natural processes associated with the comet, not alien communication.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of Discovery: Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (170 million miles)</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: 440 metres (1,444 feet) to 5.6 kilometres (3.5 miles)</li>
    <li>NASA's assessment: No technosignatures detected</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been a subject of interest since its discovery in July 2025. The comet's closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 30, 2025. As it nears Earth, it is expected to reach its closest point on December 19, 2025. Throughout this period, various observatories have monitored the comet's activity and reported findings regarding its chemical composition.</p>

<p>As of now, no evidence has been found to support claims of alien signals, with the scientific consensus firmly identifying the comet as a natural object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nikola Fox from NASA stated, "We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, NASA's Associate Administrator, affirmed, "This object is a comet... it looks and behaves like a comet. And all evidence points to it being a comet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The excitement surrounding this comet highlights the ongoing interest in interstellar objects and their potential to reveal information about the universe.</p>

<p>Despite public speculation, the scientific community has consistently reiterated that the features observed in the comet are due to hydroxyl chemistry, a natural occurrence rather than a sign of intelligent communication.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other observatories will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further studies will focus on its chemical composition and the insights it can provide about interstellar bodies.</p>
