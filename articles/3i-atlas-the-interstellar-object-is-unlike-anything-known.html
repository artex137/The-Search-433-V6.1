      <p class="byline">Published 2025-08-28 10:39 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS: The interstellar object is unlike anything known</h2>

<p>An international team of scientists led by NASA has analyzed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on July 1 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The object shows an unusual chemical composition with high levels of carbon dioxide and very little water, prompting investigations from NASA and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the origin and nature of 3I/ATLAS. Researchers are racing against time to gather data before the object becomes too distant to observe. The JWST has provided detailed observations, while the new SPHEREx probe has confirmed the presence of a massive CO₂ cloud surrounding the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The object is currently 170 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>It has a nucleus estimated to be less than one kilometer in diameter.</li>
    <li>Its perihelion will occur on October 29, 2025, at 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The object loses approximately 70 kilos of CO₂ per second.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate a CO₂ cloud over 348,000 kilometers wide surrounding 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Time is limited for observations as it will be difficult to study after October 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered 3I/ATLAS, marking the third interstellar object detected in our solar system. On August 6, the James Webb Space Telescope detected a mixture of water, carbon monoxide, and a significant concentration of carbon dioxide in the object. A few days later, SPHEREx confirmed the presence of a massive CO₂ cloud surrounding 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>As researchers work to analyze the object, they have noted its unusual trajectory, which brings it close to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. This proximity raises questions about its origins and has led to various hypotheses regarding its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Most likely the light we see comes from the core itself,” wrote astrophysicist Avi Loeb, suggesting that the object's composition resembles an ancient Kuiper Belt comet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“All the data points to an ordinary comet that has traveled from another star,” stated astronomer Samantha Lawler, emphasizing the lack of credible evidence for artificial manufacturing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed in less than a decade, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS presents a unique chemical profile and unusual behavior, which challenges existing understandings of cometary bodies.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS is crucial as it provides insights into the chemical diversity of celestial objects and the dynamics of interstellar travel.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to gather data on 3I/ATLAS over the coming weeks. Observations are critical before the object becomes difficult to study after October 2025, when it will be located on the other side of the Sun.</p>
