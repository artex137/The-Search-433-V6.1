      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-29 13:54 UTC</p>

      <h2>Jupiter will alter the path of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas in a rare cosmic encounter scheduled for 2026</h2>

<p>The trajectory of comet 3I/Atlas will be significantly altered following a close encounter with Jupiter in March 2026. The gravitational pull from Jupiter will divert the comet onto a new path, according to researchers from the Laboratório de Pesquisa Física of Simulations. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This encounter is of great interest to the scientific community as it provides a rare opportunity to study the gravitational effects of Jupiter on a body originating from outside the Solar System. Astronomers are preparing for the comet's closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, when it will be observable with medium-sized telescopes, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will reach perihelion in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Encounter with Jupiter will occur between March 9 and 22, 2026.</li>
    <li>Jupiter will alter the comet's trajectory, sending it towards the constellation of Gêmeos.</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter of 3I/Atlas is between 1 and 3 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Current speed of the comet is approximately 40 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Comet was first identified in early 2024 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was first identified in early 2024 by the ATLAS astronomical survey in Hawaii. Subsequent orbital calculations confirmed its high velocity, indicating its interstellar origin. The comet will reach perihelion in October 2025, becoming progressively brighter as it approaches the Sun. On December 19, 2025, it will make its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>The crucial encounter with Jupiter is expected to take place between March 9 and 22, 2026, when the comet will pass approximately 0.5 astronomical units from the planet. This close approach will result in a significant alteration of its orbital path.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/Atlas represents an extraordinary chance for modern astronomy,” said a researcher from the Laboratório de Pesquisa Física of Simulations. “It’s an opportunity to take a closer look at primitive material that formed around another star.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The encounter with Jupiter is significant as it allows scientists to study the gravitational interactions of a comet from another solar system. The Juno probe, currently in orbit around Jupiter, will be in a favorable position to capture high-resolution images and spectral data during the comet's passage.</p>

<p>Observatories worldwide are continuously monitoring 3I/Atlas, collecting position data to refine predictions about its orbit and the expected effects of Jupiter's gravity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe the comet as it approaches Earth and Jupiter, gathering data to analyze its composition and trajectory. The unique opportunity to study an interstellar object is expected to yield valuable insights into the materials that make up planetary systems beyond our own.</p>
