      <h2>3I/ATLAS conundrum: NASA gives Kim Kardashian 'tea' on alien comet, and Loeb now wants her on his team. Here's why</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb has invited Kim Kardashian to join his research team on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, following a conversation she had with NASA's acting administrator Sean Duffy. The interaction occurred after Kardashian inquired about the comet, which is currently near the Sun after reaching perihelion on October 29-30. NASA has not released specific data on 3I/ATLAS due to the ongoing government shutdown.</p>

<p>This situation highlights the challenges researchers face in accessing critical data during a government shutdown. Loeb, a Harvard scientist, has expressed frustration over the lack of response from NASA regarding observations made by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. His invitation to Kardashian underscores the disparity in communication between scientists and public figures.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet to pass through the solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA has not released data due to the government shutdown.</li>
    <li>Loeb has requested data from NASA’s HiRISE camera but received no response.</li>
    <li>Kardashian asked Duffy about 3I/ATLAS on October 31.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion on October 29-30.</li>
    <li>The only image of 3I/ATLAS during its Mars flyby was captured by the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 3I/ATLAS flew by Mars, and the HiRISE camera captured images of the comet. On October 29-30, the comet reached perihelion, moving closer to the Sun. On October 31, Kim Kardashian inquired about the comet during a discussion with Sean Duffy, who responded to her questions but not those from scientists, including Loeb and Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has since called attention to NASA's selective communication, criticizing the agency for not responding to scientific inquiries while engaging with a celebrity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth.” 
    <strong>- Sean Duffy, NASA acting administrator</strong>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The government shutdown and bureaucracy have led to science being held hostage.” 
    <strong>- Avi Loeb, Harvard scientist</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident reflects ongoing tensions between scientific inquiry and governmental processes, particularly during a shutdown. Loeb has previously criticized NASA for withholding crucial data that could enhance understanding of interstellar objects. The disparity in communication between public figures and scientists raises questions about accessibility to information.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb continues to seek access to data from NASA's HiRISE camera and hopes for a resolution to the government shutdown. Observations of 3I/ATLAS will be crucial once it emerges from the Sun's glare, potentially revealing more about its composition and nature.</p>
