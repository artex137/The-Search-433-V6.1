      <h2>Radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS mobilize NASA to intensify planetary protection</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense protocol following the detection of radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS, an unprecedented interstellar object, on October 24, 2025. The comet, first observed on July 1, 2025, is traveling towards Earth at a speed of 100,000 kilometers per hour and is classified as a fragment ejected from another star system tens of thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for understanding the formation of planetary systems beyond our own. NASA and the global scientific community are now focused on analyzing the comet's emissions and ensuring safety as it approaches Earth. The comet will pass at a distance of 27 million kilometers on December 19, 2025, which poses no risk of collision.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Radio signals were detected on October 24, 2025, at a frequency of 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at a speed of 100,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Its minimum approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA's planetary defense protocol has been activated in response to the comet's unusual characteristics.</li>
    <li>Scientists from the Universidade of Harvard and the Agência Espacial Europeia (ESA) are involved in the analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS system first identified comet 3I/ATLAS. This marked the beginning of scientific interest in the object, which is classified as the third interstellar object identified outside our solar system. Following its initial observation, NASA's Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária launched an expanded observation campaign in August 2025 to monitor the comet.</p>

<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa recorded radio signals from 3I/ATLAS, confirming its active status as an interstellar comet. The comet's trajectory will bring it within a safe distance from Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of radio signals from 3I/ATLAS is a rare occurrence that reinforces its classification as an active interstellar comet,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Our team is closely monitoring its trajectory to ensure safety and gather valuable scientific data.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its stability and unique characteristics compared to other interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov. Previous studies have shown significant gas emissions from other comets, while 3I/ATLAS exhibits different internal processes. This distinction could provide insights into the diversity of cometary activity across different star systems.</p>

<p>The ongoing analysis aims to uncover the chemical composition and formation processes of comets from other galaxies, contributing to a broader understanding of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The focus will be on analyzing the internal changes in the comet's composition and understanding how its activity may influence Earth's atmosphere. Further observations will enhance knowledge about the formation of celestial bodies in distant star systems.</p>
