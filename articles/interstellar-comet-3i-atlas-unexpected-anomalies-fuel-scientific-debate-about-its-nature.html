      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: unexpected anomalies fuel scientific debate about its nature</h2>

<p>An unprecedented anomaly in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, detected by NASA on November 5, 2025, has sparked intense debate among astronomers. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, displayed unusual behavior and composition that challenge existing cosmological models. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may lead to a fundamental revision of our understanding of cometary bodies and their interactions with the interplanetary environment. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS will pass 270 million kilometers from Earth, posing no risk of impact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on November 5, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovered by ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025, in Chile</li>
    <li>Comet travels at 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Passed perihelion on October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Lost approximately 13% of its mass after perihelion</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>First radio emissions recorded at frequencies of 1.665 GHz and 1.667 GHz in November 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. It was detected as it approached the inner solar system. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025. Observations on November 3 revealed an anticoda, an unusual structure pointing towards the Sun. However, this structure disappeared two days later, replaced by a tail extending over 56,000 kilometers.</p>

<p>On November 5, NASA reported the anomaly, which has led to discussions in the scientific community about the object's unusual composition. Further analysis revealed the presence of a nickel alloy, differing from typical cometary materials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The rapid transition in the comet's morphology challenges conventional explanations based solely on gas sublimation,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Our observations provide a unique window into the chemical conditions of its home star system,” the representative added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, interstellar comets such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov had provided valuable insights into celestial bodies from outside our solar system. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS may further enrich the understanding of these objects and their origins.</p>

<p>The scientific community is closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it may lead to a reevaluation of theories regarding the formation and expulsion of comets from their original stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans new observations with the Very Large Array to analyze the emissions from 3I/ATLAS in greater detail. These investigations aim to deepen understanding of the comet's unique properties and its implications for celestial mechanics.</p>
