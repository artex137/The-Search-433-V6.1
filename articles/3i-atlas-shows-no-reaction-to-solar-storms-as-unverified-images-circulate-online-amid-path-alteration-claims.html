      <h2>3I/ATLAS shows no reaction to solar storms as unverified images circulate online amid path alteration claims</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shown no visible response to recent solar storms, according to reports from The Economic Times and astronomers. Despite its close approach to the Sun, the object displayed no gas emissions or tail formation typical of cometary activity. Unverified images circulating online have raised discussions about a possible alteration in its trajectory.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as ongoing monitoring efforts are examining data to confirm the object's path. Currently, no evidence indicates a change in 3I/ATLAS's trajectory following its perihelion on October 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The object’s closest approach to Earth was approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>It passed near Mars at a distance of 29 million kilometers on October 2–3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to be monitored by ESA's JUICE mission from November 2 to 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Eyes on the Solar System platform provides real-time tracking of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The object approached the Sun and reached its perihelion on October 30, 2025. During this period, it exhibited no visible signs of activity such as gas emissions or tail formation.</p>
<p>On October 2–3, 2025, the object passed closest to Mars, allowing for enhanced observation by various space agencies. Following its solar encounter, unverified images began circulating online, leading to discussions regarding its trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Data from ongoing monitoring efforts are being examined, but as of now, no confirmed evidence indicates a change in the comet’s path,” according to observations shared by astronomers.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The name “3I” signifies its interstellar origin, while “ATLAS” refers to the system that identified it. The object is moving along a hyperbolic path, suggesting it will not return after its visit to the solar system.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects have exhibited varying levels of activity, with many showing visible tails and gas emissions. The lack of such activity in 3I/ATLAS has raised questions regarding its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as more data becomes available from various missions. ESA's JUICE mission is expected to provide further insights by February 2026, which may clarify whether the comet remains inactive or exhibits delayed activity as it moves away from the Sun.</p>
