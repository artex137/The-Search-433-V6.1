      <h2>Trump orders release of government UFO, alien files</h2>

<p>On Thursday, February 20, 2026, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he is directing federal agencies to begin identifying and releasing official documents related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and extraterrestrial life. The announcement was made via a post on Trump's Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>This decision responds to decades of public interest in UFOs and alien encounters. Trump has instructed the Secretary of War and other relevant departments to initiate the release process, though he did not specify whether classified documents would be included.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Announcement date: February 20, 2026.</li>
  <li>Location: United States.</li>
  <li>President: Donald Trump.</li>
  <li>Platform for announcement: Truth Social.</li>
  <li>Relevant agencies: Secretary of War and other federal departments.</li>
  <li>Previous comments by Barack Obama on alien life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 20, 2026, President Trump ordered the release of government files related to UFOs and alien life. He cited public interest as a key factor in his decision. Earlier in the day, Trump commented on remarks made by former President Barack Obama regarding classified information on alien life, stating that Obama had disclosed information he should not have.</p>

<p>In his post, Trump indicated that the files to be released would encompass all information related to UFOs and extraterrestrial matters. He also mentioned that he remains uncertain about the existence of aliens.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs),” Trump stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“He made a big mistake,” Trump said regarding Obama's comments on alien life.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UFOs has surged in recent years, partly due to numerous reports of unidentified aerial phenomena that have been investigated by the U.S. government. A Pentagon study released in March 2024 concluded that there was no evidence linking these phenomena to alien technology. The government's previous investigations often revealed that sightings were attributable to weather balloons, surveillance planes, or other conventional activities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Federal agencies are expected to begin the process of identifying and releasing documents related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life. The timeline for this release has not been disclosed. Further investigations into UAP sightings may continue as public interest remains high.</p>
