      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Reveals Stunning Images from Telescopes</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has evolved from a small dot in early images to a large, bright object with a glowing tail, as observed by various telescopes around the world since its discovery in late 2025. The comet is currently traversing the Solar System and will disappear behind the Sun by late October 2025.</p>

<p>This comet is significant because it is one of only three interstellar visitors ever recorded. Scientists and astronomers are making extensive observations to gather as much information as possible before it exits the Solar System permanently. The comet is estimated to be over seven billion years old, likely making it older than our Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in late 2025.</li>
    <li>It will disappear behind the Sun by late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Re-emergence expected in November 2025.</li>
    <li>Age estimated at over seven billion years.</li>
    <li>Observed by multiple telescopes including ATLAS, Very Large Telescope, Gemini North, Hubble, SPHEREx, and James Webb.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile in late 2025. Following its discovery, various telescopes have captured images of the comet in different wavelengths.</p>

<p>In July 2025, the Very Large Telescope in Chile provided composite images showing the comet's movement. The Gemini North Telescope in Hawai‘i observed the comet's coma and its chemical composition later that month.</p>

<p>By August 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope and SPHEREx had also captured significant images, revealing the presence of water ice and carbon dioxide. The comet's activity increased, and its tail extended as it traveled through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re throwing all of our observing prowess at it while it’s here,” said a representative from the European Southern Observatory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The observations from SPHEREx and the James Webb Space Telescope have provided insights into the comet's chemical makeup,” noted a NASA scientist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its age but also for being one of the few interstellar objects ever observed. Previous interstellar comets have provided valuable information about the early Solar System and the materials present in the galaxy.</p>

<p>The ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS contribute to a broader understanding of cometary science and the potential for future interstellar visits.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, the European Space Agency plans to capture images with its Juice spacecraft. Observations will continue as astronomers aim to gather more data before the comet exits the Solar System.</p>
