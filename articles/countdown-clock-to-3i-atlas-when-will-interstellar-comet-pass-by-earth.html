      <h2>Countdown clock to 3I/ATLAS. When will interstellar comet pass by Earth?</h2>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on multiple occasions, most recently on November 30, 2025, as it approaches Earth. The comet is projected to pass within approximately 170 million miles of Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its status as the third object confirmed to originate from outside the solar system. Observations have drawn considerable public interest, including from celebrities and scientists alike. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is projected to pass Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will be about 170 million miles from Earth, approximately twice the distance between Earth and the sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025, traveling at about 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Size estimates range from about 1,400 feet to 3.5 miles across.</li>
    <li>Hubble's latest observation occurred on November 30, 2025, when the comet was 178 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet is not visible to the naked eye but can be observed using a small telescope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was confirmed as the third object discovered originating outside the solar system. It was observed traveling at a high speed, confirming its interstellar origin. Hubble's initial sighting helped estimate its size.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2025, Hubble captured another image of 3I/ATLAS, tracking its movement across the sky. At this point, the comet was about 178 million miles from Earth.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to pass Earth on December 19, 2025, continuing its journey out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Hubble's first glimpse of 3I/ATLAS has helped determine its size," said a representative from NASA. "While we don’t know exactly how big it is, estimates range from a few hundred feet to a few miles across.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects, following the discoveries of other similar bodies. Its unique trajectory and origin provide insights into the dynamics of our galaxy and the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth, offering opportunities for further observations and public engagement.</p>
