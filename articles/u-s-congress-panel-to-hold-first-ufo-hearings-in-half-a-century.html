      <h2>U.S. Congress panel to hold first UFO hearings in half a century</h2>

<p>Two top U.S. defense intelligence officials are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, May 17, 2022, about unidentified flying objects, marking the first public congressional hearing on the topic in more than 50 years. The hearing comes 11 months after a report documented over 140 cases of what the government calls "unidentified aerial phenomena" (UAPs), observed by U.S. military pilots since 2004.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it represents a shift in government transparency regarding UAPs. Authorities aim to address national security and aviation safety implications related to these sightings. The session will re-examine findings from a nine-page preliminary assessment compiled by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and a Navy-led task force established in 2020.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing date: May 17, 2022</li>
    <li>Location: Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Officials testifying: Ronald Moultrie and Scott Bray</li>
    <li>Number of UAP cases reported: 140</li>
    <li>Previous assessments conducted: Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Navy-led task force</li>
    <li>New agency established: Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2004, U.S. military pilots began reporting sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena. In June 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report detailing 140 cases of UAPs. The report did not provide conclusive findings regarding the origins of these sightings. The Navy task force was replaced in November 2021 by the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group.</p>

<p>The last public congressional hearing on UFOs took place in 1969, following the termination of Project Blue Book, which recorded 12,618 UFO sightings during its 17-year duration. The project concluded that there was no indication of a national security threat or evidence of extraterrestrial vehicles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The American people deserve full transparency,” said Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff in a statement prior to the hearings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The report released in June 2021 marked a pivotal moment for the U.S. government, which has historically downplayed and discredited UFO sightings since the 1940s. Prior to this, incidents often faced skepticism and dismissal, particularly after the Air Force's Project Blue Book findings.</p>

<p>While the report did not attribute any of the sightings to extraterrestrial origins, it left the door open for further investigation into potential explanations, including foreign technologies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the hearing, officials will continue to analyze data related to UAPs. Further assessments and investigations are anticipated as agencies seek to clarify the nature of these phenomena and their implications for national security.</p>
