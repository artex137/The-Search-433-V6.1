      <h2>3I/Atlas has a date with Mars on October 3</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas will pass close to Mars on October 3, 2023, with various space agencies preparing their orbiters to capture images of the comet as it approaches the red planet. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This close encounter is significant for scientists as it offers a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and China have all mobilized their Martian orbiters to gather data that could provide insights into the comet's composition and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: October 3, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 29 million kilometres</li>
    <li>NASA spacecraft launched: 2005</li>
    <li>ESA orbiters in operation: Mars Express (since 2003), ExoMars (nearly a decade old)</li>
    <li>China's Tianwen-1 mission launched: 2020</li>
    <li>Spatial resolution of HiRISE camera: 30 kilometres per pixel</li>
    <li>Estimated size of 3I/Atlas: approximately 1 kilometre (some estimates suggest over 5 kilometres)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has been on a trajectory toward Mars since its discovery. The comet is the third interstellar visitor detected in our solar system. As it nears Mars, space agencies have prepared their instruments to observe the object closely.</p>

<p>On October 3, the HiRISE camera aboard NASA's orbiter will capture high-resolution images of 3I/Atlas. The ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars orbiters will also turn their attention to the comet, while China's Tianwen-1 mission will monitor the event from its orbit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This close approach gives us a unique chance to study an interstellar object,” said a representative from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has generated significant interest in the scientific community due to its interstellar origin. Previous interstellar objects, like 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable data, prompting scientists to seek more information about the nature of such comets.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/Atlas may help researchers understand the formation and evolution of our solar system, as well as the characteristics of materials from beyond our solar neighborhood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the close encounter on October 3, data collected from the orbiters will be analyzed to gain insights into 3I/Atlas. Scientists expect to publish findings in the coming months, contributing to the ongoing research on interstellar objects.</p>
