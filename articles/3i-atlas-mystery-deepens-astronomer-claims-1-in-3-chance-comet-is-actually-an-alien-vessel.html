      <h2>3I/ATLAS mystery deepens - Astronomer claims 1-in-3 chance comet is actually an alien vessel</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a renowned astronomer from Harvard, has raised the possibility that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, discovered in early July, may not be a natural comet but rather an alien technology. Loeb estimates a 30 to 40 percent chance that the object, which is currently passing through our solar system, is disguised as a comet.</p>

<p>This theory has sparked significant interest among scientists and space agencies. The European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA are preparing missions to gather more data about 3I/ATLAS, which could clarify its origins and characteristics. As the object approaches the Sun, it may reveal crucial information about its nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb estimates a 30 to 40 percent chance that it is not of natural origin.</li>
    <li>The object has an estimated mass of 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Upcoming missions include ESA’s Juice spacecraft and NASA’s Juno, scheduled for next month and March 2024, respectively.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Perseverance rover has captured images of 3I/ATLAS near Mars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in early July 2023. Since then, scientists have been studying its trajectory and composition. Loeb has publicly shared his theory about the object's possible alien origins, which has generated both interest and skepticism in the scientific community. NASA and ESA are planning close observations of the object during its approach to the Sun and Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As of now, I assign a 30 to 40 percent likelihood that 3I/ATLAS does not have a fully natural origin,” Loeb wrote in a recent Q&A post on his blog.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one,” said Colin Wilson, ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars project scientist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. Previous interstellar visitors, including 'Oumuamua, have prompted discussions about the potential for alien technology. Loeb has previously suggested that 'Oumuamua might have been an alien probe, which has contributed to his reputation for advocating an open-minded approach to the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As new data from the upcoming missions becomes available, scientists will continue to investigate the origins of 3I/ATLAS. The findings could either confirm its natural characteristics or add to the ongoing debate regarding its nature.</p>
