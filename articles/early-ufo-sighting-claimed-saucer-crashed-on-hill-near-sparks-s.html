      <h2>Early UFO sighting claimed saucer crashed on hill near Sparks 'S'</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has stated that aliens are “real” during an interview posted on Saturday, causing renewed interest in UFO sightings, particularly in Nevada. This statement follows a historical account from July 1947 when a man claimed a UFO crashed into a mountain near Sparks, Nevada.</p>

<p>This recent comment by Obama highlights ongoing public fascination with extraterrestrial life and UFO phenomena. Local authorities and historians are revisiting past incidents and reports as interest in the subject continues to grow, particularly in areas with a rich history of UFO sightings like Nevada.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Former President Barack Obama made the comments on February 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The first widespread reports of UFOs in Nevada occurred in July 1947.</li>
    <li>A man reported a UFO crash near Sparks on July 6, 1947.</li>
    <li>City editor John Brackett and his wife spotted a flying disc over Reno on July 7, 1947.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 24, 1947, a pilot reported seeing “flying saucers” near Mt. Rainier, marking the first modern-day UFO sighting. Following this, Nevada had its first recorded sighting on July 6, 1947, when a man informed the Nevada State Journal about a UFO crash near Sparks. The next day, on July 7, city editor John Brackett and his wife reported seeing a flying disc over Reno.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“At least eight other persons in Reno saw the same thing we did,” Brackett stated in the July 8 edition of the Journal. “I’m glad of that, because the kidding one takes is terrific. I personally don’t think these hundreds of tales going around about them are so funny anymore.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 1947 UFO sightings in Nevada occurred during a period of heightened public interest in unidentified flying objects, spurred by the Roswell incident in New Mexico. This event marked the beginning of what is now considered the modern UFO phenomenon, leading to numerous reports and investigations over the decades.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and historians are expected to continue exploring past UFO sightings in light of recent statements from public figures, as interest in extraterrestrial life remains strong among the public.</p>
