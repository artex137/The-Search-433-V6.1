      <h2>New Black-and-White Image of 3I/ATLAS Reveals Matching Structural Geometry and Rapid Spin Waves</h2>

<p>A new black-and-white image of comet 3I/ATLAS has confirmed findings of rapid spin waves and a consistent geometric structure, according to Ray’s Astronomy. The image, taken recently, matches an earlier observation from October 21, 2025, captured by AstroPhotoG. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges the understanding of cometary behavior. The findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS may not conform to characteristics typical of natural comets. Authorities, including NASA and ESA, are under increasing pressure for transparency regarding the true nature of this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>New image captured by Ray’s Astronomy, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Previous image taken on October 21, 2025, by AstroPhotoG.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS shows rapid spin waves moving through its coma.</li>
    <li>The object rotates on a timescale of minutes.</li>
    <li>Nickel-vapor signature detected, lacking detectable iron.</li>
    <li>Next high-resolution observations expected within days.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 21, 2025, AstroPhotoG captured an image of 3I/ATLAS, revealing a bright central core and a structured envelope. This observation raised questions due to its geometric symmetry and unusual features. Weeks later, Ray’s Astronomy released a new image that confirmed the shape and structural details of the object, indicating it spins significantly faster than typical comets.</p>
<p>As data from both observations align, scientists are prompted to reconsider the classification of 3I/ATLAS. The new findings suggest a coherent shape beneath its coma, contrary to known comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The persistence of its geometric signature and the extraordinary spin rate leave scientists with uncomfortable questions,” Ray’s Astronomy noted in a statement.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Natural comets typically exhibit chaotic jets and do not maintain stable geometric shapes over time. Previous observations of 3I/ATLAS have shown anomalies, including a nickel-rich vapor signature without iron, which is uncommon for comets. The new data raises the possibility that 3I/ATLAS may be an engineered object or a remnant of exotic astrophysical chemistry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its December visibility window, new datasets are expected to arrive. Scientists will continue to analyze the structural alignment between early and late-phase images, with upcoming observations likely to provide further clarity on the nature of this interstellar visitor.</p>
