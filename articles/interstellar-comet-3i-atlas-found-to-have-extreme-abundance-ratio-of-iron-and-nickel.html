      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Found To Have "Extreme Abundance Ratio" Of Iron And Nickel</h2>

<p>A new study has revealed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS contains an unusual abundance of iron and nickel in its coma. Astronomers first spotted the comet on July 1, 2025, moving through the Solar System at nearly twice the velocity of previous interstellar objects, ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. The comet has an estimated nucleus size of about 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) and a mass exceeding 33 billion tons, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about the composition of interstellar comets. The astronomical community is closely monitoring the object as it approaches the Sun. However, it has recently vanished from view behind the Sun after potentially being impacted by a coronal mass ejection, and it is not expected to reappear until later this year.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The nucleus is estimated to be 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) in size.</li>
    <li>The mass of the comet is estimated to exceed 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently obscured by the Sun and will reappear later this year.</li>
    <li>The study on its composition has not yet been peer-reviewed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected comet 3I/ATLAS moving through the Solar System. The object was identified as an interstellar comet with a dusty coma and was confirmed to be larger and faster than previous interstellar visitors.</p>
<p>After being observed, the comet was impacted by a coronal mass ejection and subsequently disappeared from view behind the Sun. Researchers have continued to analyze data collected prior to its obscuration.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Emission lines of FeI and NiI are commonly found in the coma of Solar System comets, even at large heliocentric distances. These atoms are most likely released from the surface of the comet’s nucleus or from a short-lived parent,” the research team stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The presence of these lines in cometary spectra is unexpected because the surface blackbody equilibrium temperature is too low to allow the sublimation of refractory minerals containing these metals,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study provides the first look at an interstellar comet and raises questions about the formation and composition of such objects. Previous interstellar comet 2I/Borisov exhibited a nickel and iron abundance ratio similar to that of Solar System comets, but 3I/ATLAS presents a significantly different ratio. These findings may alter our understanding of cometary chemistry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from comet 3I/ATLAS as it re-emerges from behind the Sun later this year. Further observations will help clarify the origins of the unusual metals found in its coma.</p>
