      <h2>NASA’s Parker Solar Probe Captures 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA’s Parker Solar Probe has captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from October 18 to November 5, 2025, while the spacecraft was positioned beyond the orbit of Mars. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this observation.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides valuable data on 3I/ATLAS, which could enhance understanding of interstellar objects. According to NASA, the images were taken when the comet was too close to the Sun to be viewed from Earth, making this data crucial for ongoing research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025, at a distance of 0.194 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million km (168 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Imaging Period:</strong> October 18 to November 5, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Imaging Rate:</strong> Approximately 10 images per day</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Sun during Imaging:</strong> About 209 million km (130 million miles)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, followed by its perihelion on October 30. NASA’s Parker Solar Probe began capturing images of the comet on October 18, continuing until November 5, 2025. The comet reached its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Parker Solar Probe snapped around 10 images of the comet per day,” said members of the WISPR team. “During this period, the spacecraft was speeding away from the Sun following its 25th solar flyby on September 15.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The final images will ultimately help us better study this interstellar visitor,” the researchers stated regarding the ongoing processing of the data.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) and A11pl3Z, is notable for being an interstellar comet, providing insights into the composition and behavior of such objects. The ATLAS survey telescope has previously identified other celestial bodies, contributing to the understanding of interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The WISPR team will continue processing the images to eliminate stray sunlight and adjust for exposure times. This will ensure the final data is accurate for further analysis of the comet.</p>
