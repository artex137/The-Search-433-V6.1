      <h2>3I/ATLAS, Kim Kardashian, Avi Loeb & NASA: What’s The Tea? Harvard Scientist Invites Reality Star To Study The Comet</h2>

<p>A growing conversation has emerged around comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial Last Alert System (ATLAS). The comet has sparked public interest and speculation about its origins, particularly regarding the possibility of it being an alien craft. Notably, reality star Kim Kardashian has engaged with the topic, prompting a response from NASA regarding the comet’s nature.</p>

<p>The comet approached its perihelion distance from the Sun on October 29 and October 30, further fueling public intrigue. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has raised concerns about 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it might be a technological object rather than a natural comet. He has requested images from NASA captured during the comet’s close approach to Mars, but has yet to receive a response. The public is calling for NASA to release high-resolution images of the comet, raising questions about transparency from the agency.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet 3I/ATLAS</strong> detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Reached perihelion on <strong>October 29 and 30, 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>NASA's Acting Administrator <strong>Sean Duffy</strong> confirmed no threat from the comet.</li>
    <li><strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has requested images from NASA but has not received a response.</li>
    <li>Congresswoman <strong>Anna Paulina Luna</strong> formally requested NASA to release imagery of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>, comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by ATLAS. Following its detection, public interest surged, particularly regarding its potential extraterrestrial origins. The comet reached its closest distance to the Sun on <strong>October 29 and 30, 2025</strong>, leading to increased discussions online.</p>

<p>On <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>, Kim Kardashian posted on X, asking NASA about the comet, which prompted a response from Sean Duffy, who clarified that the comet poses no threat and confirmed its interstellar status. Subsequently, Avi Loeb expressed concerns about the lack of information from NASA and invited Kardashian to join his research team.</p>

<p>On <strong>November 3, 2025</strong>, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna formally requested the release of images of 3I/ATLAS from NASA, reflecting the heightened interest in the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth.”</blockquote>
<p>- Sean Duffy, NASA Acting Administrator</p>

<blockquote>“Kim Kardashian is Welcome to Join my Research Team on 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>
<p>- Avi Loeb, Harvard Scientist</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar objects to traverse the solar system, drawing significant attention from scientists and the public alike. Its behavior, including non-gravitational acceleration near perihelion, has raised questions regarding its origins and composition, leading to increased scrutiny from the scientific community.</p>

<p>The public’s fascination with potential extraterrestrial life continues to grow, especially as high-profile figures like Kim Kardashian engage with scientific topics and inquiries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in comet 3I/ATLAS intensifies, NASA faces mounting pressure to release the requested high-resolution images. The scientific community and the public await further updates on the comet's characteristics and origins as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>
