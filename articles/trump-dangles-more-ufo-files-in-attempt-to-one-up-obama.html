      <h2>Trump Announces Release of UFO Files Amid Public Interest</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump has announced that he will release previously unseen files related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) on Thursday, as public interest in the subject continues to grow. The announcement comes amid ongoing scrutiny of his administration and its connections to various controversies.</p>

<p>Trump stated on Truth Social that the files will include information from the Defense Department and other government agencies, describing the topics as “highly complex, but extremely interesting and important.” The release aims to contribute to a slow trickle of information that has emerged since 2017 regarding UFOs. As of now, it remains unclear how the Defense Department will manage the release of classified material to the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump announced the release of UFO files on Truth Social on Thursday.</li>
    <li>The files will include information from the Defense Department.</li>
    <li>Public interest has spurred the release, according to Trump.</li>
    <li>No timeline has been provided for when the files will be released.</li>
    <li>Critics suggest the timing may serve as a distraction from other issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday morning, former President Barack Obama stated in an interview that aliens are real, leading to a swift response from Trump later that day. On Air Force One, Trump criticized Obama for allegedly disclosing classified information regarding UFOs.</p>

<p>Trump's announcement about the UFO files followed shortly after, as he sought to assert his stance on the topic, aiming to overshadow Obama's comments. The Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, responded to Trump's directive with a social media post, indicating that the administration is prepared to engage with the public on the subject of UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“So aliens are real?” a reporter asked Trump. “Well, I don’t know if they’re real or not,” Trump replied, emphasizing that Obama made a mistake by giving out classified information.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The announcement comes amid a broader discussion on UFOs that has gained momentum since 2017, when the government began to release information regarding UAP encounters. Previous disclosures have often been met with skepticism, as many instances have been attributed to common objects like balloons and drones.</p>

<p>Trump's motivations for the announcement have been scrutinized, with some suggesting it is an attempt to divert attention from other pressing issues facing his administration, including his connections to the Jeffrey Epstein case and escalating tensions with Iran.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Defense Department will need to establish a process for the public release of the classified files. No specific timeline has been disclosed for when this information will become available.</p>
