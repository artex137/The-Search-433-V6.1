      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-22 02:26 UTC</p>

      <h2>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shines in X-rays</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which entered our solar system in July 2025, will reach its closest distance to Earth on December 19, 2025. Currently, the comet is approximately 286 million kilometers from Earth, as astronomers study its unique characteristics.</p>

<p>This observation is significant for scientists who are eager to learn more about the comet's composition and origin. A global network of observatories has been activated to monitor 3I/ATLAS, and new data has emerged regarding its unusual chemical makeup and physical behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS arrived in the solar system on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Hubble Space Telescope observed the comet on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>ESA's XMM-Newton observatory tracked the comet on December 3, 2025, for about 20 hours.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has an unusually high ratio of carbon dioxide to water.</li>
    <li>The comet is likely billions of years old and has been exposed to cosmic rays.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the solar system on July 1, 2025. After initial observations, astronomers from the European Space Agency activated telescopes in various locations, including Hawaii, Chile, and Australia. The comet reemerged from behind the Sun in early November 2025, revealing increased cometary activity.</p>

<p>On November 30, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet from a distance of about 286 million kilometers. Later, on December 3, 2025, ESA’s XMM-Newton observatory tracked the comet, detecting low-energy X-rays emitted from it.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations of 3I/ATLAS provide a unique opportunity to study the properties of an interstellar object,” said a spokesperson from the European Space Agency. “The data collected will help us understand the conditions in distant planetary systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unusual chemical composition, particularly its high carbon dioxide content, sets it apart from typical comets found in our solar system. This could suggest it formed under different conditions than those of local comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The data collected will contribute to ongoing research about the origins and evolution of interstellar objects.</p>
