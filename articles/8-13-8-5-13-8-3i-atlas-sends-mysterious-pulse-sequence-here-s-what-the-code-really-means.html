      <h2>3I/ATLAS Sends Mysterious Pulse Sequence</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected a strange pattern of pulses from 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, as it travels through our Solar System. The sequence—8, 13, 8, 5, 13, 8—has raised questions among researchers, who are examining its implications. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it may represent the first deliberate signal ever received from an interstellar visitor. Authorities in the scientific community are currently investigating the source of the pulses, which have been synchronized across observatories on different continents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025 by Hawaii’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Pulse frequency: 1420 MHz, considered a “cosmic calling card” by SETI researchers</li>
    <li>Signal detected across 15,000 kilometres</li>
    <li>Next expected visibility: December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. Scientists first noticed the unusual pulse sequence shortly thereafter. Initial thoughts were that the signal might be noise or interference, but the synchronized detection across global observatories refuted that theory.</p>
<p>In the weeks following, some researchers speculated that the pulse pattern resembled the Fibonacci sequence. An anonymous source later claimed to have decoded the pulses into a message: “Observe. Prepare. Understand. The Gate Awaits.”</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We urge caution,” an astronomer stated, emphasizing the need for official verification before drawing conclusions about the signal's significance.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is often compared to Oumuamua, another interstellar object that sparked debates about extraterrestrial origins in 2017. Both objects share unusual characteristics that have intrigued scientists and the public alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze the pulse sequence for further clues. No formal investigations or charges are currently underway, as the scientific community remains focused on verification and understanding of the signal.</p>
