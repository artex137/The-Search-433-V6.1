      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS intrigues scientists with anomalous orbit and precise encounter with Jupiter in 2026</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has captured the attention of scientists worldwide due to its unusual trajectory and a scheduled close encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026. The comet, which is the third confirmed interstellar object, exhibits a remarkable alignment with Jupiter’s gravitational influence, with an estimated probability of such precision at one in 26,000, according to NASA scientists.</p>

<p>This encounter presents a rare opportunity for researchers to study gravitational interactions between interstellar objects and large planets. NASA, in collaboration with other space agencies and ground-based observatories, is intensifying efforts to analyze the comet’s chemical composition and monitor its trajectory. This research aims to deepen understanding of planetary systems beyond our own and the dynamics of objects traveling intergalactic distances.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified on June 14, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It is traveling at a speed of 60 km/s.</li>
    <li>NASA and other agencies are conducting observations using advanced telescopes and space probes.</li>
    <li>The comet has a hyperbolic orbit with an eccentricity greater than six.</li>
    <li>Significant findings include a CO2 to water ratio of 8:1 and high levels of carbon monoxide detected in August 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has displayed an anti-tail extending over one million kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on June 14, 2025, by the Zwicky Transient Facility. In July 2025, detailed analysis by the James Webb Space Telescope revealed high levels of carbon dioxide in the comet's coma. In August 2025, additional observations confirmed the presence of carbon monoxide and detected a composition rich in cyanide and nickel vapor.</p>
<p>The comet's perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, adjusting its trajectory for the upcoming encounter with Jupiter. On November 4, 2025, ESA's Juice probe performed a flyby of the comet, collecting data in various wavelengths. Observations continued into late 2025, with significant findings regarding the comet's structure and activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unique passage of 3I/ATLAS through our solar system, combined with analyses of its composition, promises to rewrite part of what we know about comets,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows in the footsteps of two other interstellar objects, ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, each presenting unique characteristics. The comet's hyperbolic orbit and chemical composition suggest it originated from a carbon-rich protoplanetary disk in a distant star system, providing insights into the formation of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches its close encounter with Jupiter, ongoing observations and analyses will continue to deepen understanding of its origin and behavior. NASA and collaborating agencies will monitor the comet's trajectory and chemical activity closely, aiming to gather as much data as possible before and during the encounter.</p>
