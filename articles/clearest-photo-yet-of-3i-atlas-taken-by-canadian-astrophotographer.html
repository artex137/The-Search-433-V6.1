      <h2>Clearest Photo Yet of 3I/ATLAS Taken by Canadian Astrophotographer</h2>

<p>A Canadian astrophotographer has captured what may be the clearest images of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, as confirmed by Paul Craggs on 22 November 2023. Craggs shared three images of the comet, taken with his Dwarf 3 telescope, showing a distinct shape without a cometary tail. The images have generated significant discussion within the scientific community regarding the nature of the object.</p>

<p>This development matters because it has reignited debates about whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet or something more unusual. Harvard astronomer Professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the object exhibits characteristics that warrant further investigation. NASA has also released images taken from Mars, but Craggs's photographs appear clearer than those provided by the U.S. space agency.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Photographs shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Paul Craggs on 22 November 2023.</li>
    <li>Images were captured using a Dwarf 3 telescope.</li>
    <li>NASA released images of 3I/ATLAS from Mars missions on 19 November 2023.</li>
    <li>Images taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, and Perseverance Rover.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was approximately 0.2 astronomical units away from Mars during observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 19 November 2023, NASA conducted a livestream event where it released images of 3I/ATLAS taken from its Mars missions. This was shortly after the reopening of the federal government. On 22 November 2023, Canadian astrophotographer Paul Craggs shared his clearer images of the comet, sparking renewed interest and debate about its classification.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is apparent that 3I/ATLAS is an extremely rare and mysterious object, especially if it happens to be a natural comet, as argued by NASA officials at the press conference on 19 November 2023,” said Professor Loeb in a post on Medium.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Observations of interstellar objects are still rare enough that we learn something new on every occasion. We're fortunate that 3I/ATLAS passed this close to Mars,” said Shane Byrne, HiRISE principal investigator at the University of Arizona.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is one of those occasions where we get to study a passing space object as well,” said Leslie Tamppari, MRO project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS has been marked by speculation about its true nature. Professor Loeb has identified 13 anomalies in the object, classifying six as major. This has led to ongoing debates in the scientific community about the significance of these findings and their implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to continue observing 3I/ATLAS using various telescopes, including ground-based and space-based instruments. Further analysis of Craggs's images may also provide additional insights into the object's characteristics.</p>
