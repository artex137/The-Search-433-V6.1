      <h2>U.S. drone missile hits unidentified object; it keeps flying</h2>

<p>On October 30, 2024, a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone launched a Hellfire missile at an unidentified aerial object off the coast of Yemen, but the object continued to fly despite being struck, according to footage released by Congress on September 9, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident raises questions about the nature of the object and its potential threat to U.S. Navy operations in the region. The U.S. Navy was conducting combat operations to protect merchant shipping routes and intercept missiles and drones launched by Yemen’s Houthi rebel forces at the time of the event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of missile strike: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Footage released: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Drone type: MQ-9 Reaper</li>
    <li>Missile type: Hellfire</li>
    <li>Congressional disclosure by: Rep. Eric Burlison (Missouri)</li>
    <li>U.S. military operations ongoing in Yemen</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone tracked an unidentified object near Yemen before launching a Hellfire missile at it. The missile struck the object, which continued to fly, shedding debris. The footage remained undisclosed until it was revealed by Rep. Eric Burlison at a House Government Oversight Subcommittee hearing on September 9, 2025.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Burlison stated, “I will not explain or speculate about the video.” The object’s movement and characteristics have prompted further investigation but remain unclear.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“A Hellfire missile struck this UFO, seemed to bounce off, and the object continued on. What exactly is this?” - George Knapp, journalist specializing in UAP investigations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Apart from the object, the debris also appears to be moving along with it.” - Rep. Eric Burlison.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We have nothing to say.” - Pentagon spokesperson regarding inquiries about the video.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate UAPs across all domains. Previous incidents have led to varying conclusions, with some remaining unsolved due to technological limitations at the time of filming. The AARO has stated that advanced military sensors are necessary for accurate data collection on unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating the incident and the nature of the unidentified object. Further inquiries may be directed at the Pentagon for clarification on the footage and the object’s implications for U.S. military operations.</p>
