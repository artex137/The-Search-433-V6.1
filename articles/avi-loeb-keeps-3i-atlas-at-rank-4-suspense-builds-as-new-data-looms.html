      <h2>Avi Loeb Keeps 3I/ATLAS At Rank 4 — Suspense Builds As New Data Looms</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has maintained the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS at Rank 4 on his Loeb Classification Scale, despite its 15 documented anomalies. The decision was announced in Loeb's article titled 'Updating the Loeb Classification Scale of 3I/ATLAS,' published on Medium. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This classification is significant as it reflects Loeb's cautious approach to evaluating the origins of cosmic objects. Authorities in the scientific community are awaiting new data, particularly as 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter on 16 March 2026, which may offer clearer insights into the object's nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Current Rank:</strong> 4 on the Loeb Classification Scale</li>
    <li><strong>Author:</strong> Avi Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Next Key Event:</strong> Closest approach to Jupiter on 16 March 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Perijove Distance:</strong> 53.5 million kilometres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has classified 3I/ATLAS at Rank 4, indicating that while natural explanations are prevalent, they cannot fully account for the observed anomalies. The object is set to approach Jupiter in March 2026, a pivotal moment for further investigation.</p>
<p>Loeb's classification system aims to reduce speculation surrounding interstellar visitors and require extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims. This approach has been applied previously to other cosmic objects, including Oumuamua.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is most likely a comet of natural origin, but there are eight anomalies that endow it with a rank of 4 on the Loeb scale,” Loeb stated in his article.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb cautioned against “too much reckless conjecture,” emphasizing the need for evidence to support any claims of artificial origin.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's classification scale is designed to rank interstellar objects based on evolving evidence. It aims to eliminate guesswork and promote a rigorous scientific approach. The public has shown considerable interest in 3I/ATLAS, and Loeb's previous claims regarding Oumuamua have sparked debate about the origins of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, scientists and enthusiasts anticipate new imaging and spectroscopic data that may clarify its classification. Loeb has stated that he will not revise the ranking until new information becomes available.</p>
