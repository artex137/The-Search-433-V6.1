      <p class="byline">Published 2026-02-16 19:39 UTC</p>

      <h2>Obama Sets the Record Straight on UFOs: No Alien Evidence</h2>

<p>Former US President Barack Obama has clarified that he has seen "no evidence" of extraterrestrial life, addressing remarks that suggested he believed "aliens are real." His comments, made during an appearance on 'The Late Late Show with James Corden' on 17 May 2021, have resurfaced amid renewed public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and declassified military footage.</p>

<p>This clarification is significant as it comes at a time when Congress, the Pentagon, and the intelligence community are grappling with how to approach UAPs without fueling conspiracy theories. Obama's comments have prompted discussions about the nature of unidentified phenomena and the importance of transparency in addressing public curiosity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Obama stated he has seen "no evidence" of extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>His initial comments were made on 17 May 2021 during a talk show appearance.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon declassified three UAP videos on 27 April 2020.</li>
    <li>The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was established in July 2022.</li>
    <li>Congress has held hearings on the topic, with officials stating no evidence of alien craft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 17 May 2021, Obama appeared on 'The Late Late Show with James Corden' and jokingly mentioned asking about "aliens and flying saucers" upon taking office. He acknowledged the existence of UAPs but did not confirm any extraterrestrial connections.</p>

<p>Following the circulation of his remarks on social media, Obama reiterated on the SmartLess podcast that while there are unidentified objects in the sky, he has not seen evidence of alien contact.</p>

<p>In his recent clarification, Obama emphasized that unexplained does not equate to alien, aligning his statements with findings from the Department of Defense and congressional hearings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I have seen no evidence that there are aliens,” Obama said, reiterating that the phenomena remain unexplained but not proven to be extraterrestrial.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The renewed interest in UFOs has been fueled by the release of declassified footage and allegations from whistleblowers. The Pentagon has faced pressure from Congress to provide clarity on UAPs, with officials maintaining that some incidents remain unresolved but there is no evidence of extraterrestrial craft.</p>

<p>Obama's remarks reflect a careful balance between acknowledging the mystery of UAPs and discouraging unfounded speculation about alien life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations into UAPs continue, Congress is expected to maintain pressure on the Pentagon for further transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
