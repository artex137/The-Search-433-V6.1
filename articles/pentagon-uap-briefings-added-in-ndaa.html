      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-12 19:00 UTC</p>

      <h2>Pentagon UAP Briefings Added in NDAA</h2>

<p>The Pentagon’s UFO investigation office will now be mandated to provide expanded briefings to Congress under the fiscal year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which cleared the House on December 10, 2023, by a vote of 312-112. The Defense Department's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022 to investigate unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), has faced scrutiny over its reporting practices.</p>

<p>This development is significant as lawmakers have expressed concerns about the quantity and transparency of AARO’s reports. The new requirements aim to enhance the flow of information regarding UAP incidents, particularly those involving U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command. The NDAA seeks to improve oversight and accountability in how UAP data is collected and reported.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The NDAA mandates expanded briefings from AARO on UAPs.</li>
    <li>Briefings must cover intercepts conducted by U.S. Northern Command and NORAD.</li>
    <li>First briefing to include intercepts dating back to January 1, 2004.</li>
    <li>The NDAA eliminates duplicative reporting requirements for UAP data.</li>
    <li>The FY 2026 NDAA authorizes $900.6 billion in defense spending.</li>
    <li>The House passed the NDAA on December 10, 2023, with a 312-112 vote.</li>
    <li>Senate passage is expected the week of December 15, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 7, 2023, leadership from the House and Senate Armed Services committees released the compromise text of the FY 2026 NDAA. The House voted to pass the bill on December 10, 2023. The Senate is anticipated to vote on the NDAA the week of December 15, 2023. The White House has indicated support for the bill, which is poised to become law before the holiday recess.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The NDAA directs the AARO to provide expanded congressional briefings on UAPs,” a spokesperson for the Armed Services Committee stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The AARO was established to systematically investigate UAPs, which have garnered increasing attention from both lawmakers and the public. The push for greater transparency comes amid calls from Republicans for the declassification of UAP-related documents. The NDAA addresses previous concerns about the lack of comprehensive reporting and accountability regarding UAP incidents.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following Senate passage, the NDAA will require the AARO to implement the changes outlined in the bill, including the first expanded briefing on UAP intercepts. The AARO is also tasked with ensuring that all intelligence community elements and DOD components comply with the new data-sharing requirements.</p>
