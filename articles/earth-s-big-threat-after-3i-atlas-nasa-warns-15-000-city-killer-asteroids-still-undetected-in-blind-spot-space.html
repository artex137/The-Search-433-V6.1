      <h2>NASA Warns of Undetected 'City-Killer' Asteroids Following Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that approximately 15,000 near-Earth asteroids, termed 'city-killers', remain undetected in a 'blind spot' where telescopes struggle to look. Dr. Kelly Fast, NASA's acting Planetary Defense Officer, made this announcement on February 16 during the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

<p>This revelation highlights a significant gap in the monitoring of potential threats to Earth. NASA has only detected about 40 percent of its goal for identifying objects measuring at least 140 metres across. These asteroids pose a serious risk, as an impact from such a body could devastate a major urban area.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA has identified around 15,000 undetected near-Earth objects.</li>
    <li>Only 40 percent of the target for detection of asteroids over 140 metres has been achieved.</li>
    <li>A 140-metre asteroid can release energy equivalent to approximately 300 million tons of TNT.</li>
    <li>The DART mission successfully altered the trajectory of the asteroid Dimorphos in September 2022.</li>
    <li>The Near-Earth Object Surveyor is scheduled to launch in September 2027.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 16, 2023, Dr. Kelly Fast highlighted the threat of undetected asteroids at a scientific meeting in Phoenix. In September 2022, NASA's DART mission successfully impacted Dimorphos to test asteroid deflection capabilities. Previous monitoring gaps were exposed when asteroid 2024 YR4 passed close to Earth on December 25, 2024, raising concerns about future impacts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The real menace is the unglamorous inventory we still have not taken,” said Dr. Kelly Fast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is no equivalent spacecraft sitting ready to launch if a genuine threat appears,” noted Dr. Nancy Chabot of Johns Hopkins University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>NASA's concerns about undetected asteroids reflect a broader issue within planetary defense. While larger asteroids are being tracked, many smaller, darker bodies remain elusive. The successful DART mission shows that deflection is possible, but the lack of immediate response capabilities raises questions about preparedness.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to launch the Near-Earth Object Surveyor in September 2027 to improve detection capabilities for near-Earth asteroids. Continued investment in planetary defense is essential to address the threat posed by these undetected objects.</p>
