      <h2>Spacecraft on watch as an interstellar traveler approaches Mars</h2>

<p>Several spacecraft are monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars, with its closest approach scheduled for Friday, October 13, 2023. The comet poses no threat to Earth or other planets, remaining 18 million miles away from Mars at its closest point.</p>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as the third known object from another star system to enter our solar system. Discovered in July, the comet has been traveling at increasing speeds and is currently moving at approximately 149,000 mph. Various spacecraft, including those from the European Space Agency and NASA, are observing the comet as it moves out of view from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass 18 million miles from Mars on October 13, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It has a diameter estimated between 0.4 km and 5.6 km.</li>
    <li>The comet was traveling at 137,000 mph in July and is now at 149,000 mph.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to the sun in late October at a distance of 126 million miles.</li>
    <li>In early November, the comet will pass within 60 million miles of Venus.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur in mid-December at a distance of 167 million miles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 and has been visible from Earth until September. As it moves behind the sun, it is no longer viewable from Earth. The European Space Agency’s two Mars satellites have focused their cameras on the comet in preparation for its closest approach to Mars.</p>

<p>In late October, the comet will approach the sun at a distance of 126 million miles. Following this, it will pass near Venus in early November and approach Earth in mid-December before exiting our solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet poses no threat to Earth or other planets because its trajectory will keep it far away from those celestial bodies,” said a spokesperson from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a rare group of interstellar objects that have been observed passing through our solar system. Its trajectory and characteristics provide valuable data for scientists studying the formation and behavior of comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The European Space Agency’s JUICE spacecraft will track Comet 3I/ATLAS throughout November as it approaches the sun and prepares to exit the solar system.</p>
