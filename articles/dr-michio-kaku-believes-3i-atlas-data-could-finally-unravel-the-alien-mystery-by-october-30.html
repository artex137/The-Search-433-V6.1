      <h2>Dr. Michio Kaku believes 3I/ATLAS data could finally unravel the alien mystery by October 30</h2>

<p>Dr. Michio Kaku, a Professor at the City College of New York, has stated that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into extraterrestrial life as it reaches its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025. In an interview with NEWSMAX on October 25, 2025, Dr. Kaku discussed the significance of 3I/ATLAS, which is approximately the size of Manhattan and exhibits unusual movements.</p>

<p>This event is important for scientists and enthusiasts since it will allow for detailed observation of the comet's behavior. Dr. Kaku noted that if the object demonstrates an increase in energy during its solar pass, it could suggest that an intelligent force is influencing its trajectory. Researchers have been monitoring 3I/ATLAS since its emergence, and the upcoming solar approach is a crucial opportunity for analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dr. Michio Kaku believes 3I/ATLAS could provide answers about alien life.</li>
    <li>The comet is set to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles or 270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, has been under study since its discovery. It is characterized by a hyperbolic orbit, indicating its origin from outside the solar system. The comet's closest approach to the Sun is scheduled for October 30, 2025, which will be a key moment for scientists to observe its behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The majority believe it's just another rock from deep space, but a growing number suspect it may be something more, perhaps an intelligent visitor from another solar system,” Dr. Kaku said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The Oberth Effect says that if you were to whip around the Sun, you would pick up extra energy in the process. So, we’re gonna watch for it,” Dr. Kaku explained.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If there’s more energy going out than in, it means that there’s energy boost coming from whipping around the sun, and that requires intelligence,” he continued.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been categorized as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic orbital path. This classification is significant as it is only the third such object recorded. The comet's passage has sparked discussions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, a topic that has gained traction among scientists and the public alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists will closely monitor its behavior. They will analyze any changes in energy that may occur during the solar pass, which could provide valuable data on the nature of the comet and its potential implications for the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth.</p>
