      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS has an old image with asymmetric brightness analyzed by astronomy experts</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has analyzed an old image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing irregular brightness patterns and a bright spot offset from the center. The image was captured months before more detailed observations, according to the ATLAS monitoring system. The comet, discovered in July 2025, has a hyperbolic trajectory confirming its interstellar origin.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it highlights unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, which differ from typical comets in the Solar System. Experts have noted that the irregular features observed in the old photograph indicate distinct behavior patterns of the comet. Following the discovery, astronomers have mobilized ground and space observatories to monitor the comet closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
<li>The comet's speed exceeds <strong>200,000 kilometers per hour</strong>.</li>
<li>The perihelion occurred in December 2025, when the comet passed close to the Sun.</li>
<li>Observations show variations in gas composition released by the nucleus.</li>
<li>The comet reached its closest point to Earth in December 2025, at a distance of hundreds of millions of kilometers.</li>
<li>Data collection is ongoing to refine models of orbital dynamics in hyperbolic objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers identified comet 3I/ATLAS through the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The object was confirmed to have an interstellar origin due to its hyperbolic trajectory. In December 2025, the comet reached its perihelion, resulting in increased brightness and activity.</p>

<p>Subsequent observations with telescopes like Hubble confirmed the comet's intense activity, including visible coma and tail. The analysis of the old image has revealed significant irregularities that suggest non-gravitational acceleration.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The strange appearance in the old photo is not just a result of technical limitations, but indicates distinct characteristics of the comet’s behavior,” said an astronomy expert involved in the analysis.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Previous observations of these objects have led to the establishment of protocols for monitoring interstellar visitors.</p>

<p>The current study of 3I/ATLAS offers a rare opportunity for real-time analysis, as its visibility allows data collection from global telescope networks, providing insights into the physical processes occurring in interstellar environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels away from the Solar System. Ongoing investigations will focus on gathering data to better understand its composition and behavior.</p>
