      <h2>New NASA and ESA images show 3I/Atlas glowing with activity as the interstellar comet prepares for its December close flyby</h2>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently moving toward Earth and will make its closest approach on December 19. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This comet is significant because it is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Scientists have confirmed that there is no cause for concern, as the comet is on a one-way path and will eventually exit the solar system after its flyby. The opportunity to study such a rare visitor has generated considerable interest among researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2023.</li>
<li>The comet is currently about 178 million miles from Earth.</li>
<li>It will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</li>
<li>The Hubble Telescope captured images of the comet on November 30, 2023.</li>
<li>ESA’s Juice spacecraft also observed the comet during its active phase after a close pass to the sun.</li>
<li>3I/ATLAS is on a one-way path and will not return after this flyby.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, scientists determined it was not a typical comet but an interstellar object originating from beyond our solar system. On November 30, 2023, NASA's Hubble Telescope captured images of the comet from a distance of approximately 178 million miles. ESA's Juice spacecraft also observed the comet during its most active phase after a recent close approach to the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All signs so far show it is simply a natural comet behaving as expected,” a NASA spokesperson stated regarding online speculation about the comet's nature.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object documented in our solar system. Past interstellar visitors have provided valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system. The rarity of such events makes the study of 3I/ATLAS particularly significant for astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, scientists will continue to monitor it using various telescopes and spacecraft. Observations will be conducted until the comet exits the solar system, providing valuable data about its composition and behavior.</p>
