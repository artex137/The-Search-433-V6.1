      <h2>Astronomers watch interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approach collapse due to solar heat</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, identified as 3I/ATLAS, is under close observation as it approaches perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, with signs of possible disintegration. Discovered in 2023, the comet is currently in a trajectory that could lead to fragmentation due to extreme solar heat, according to astronomers monitoring the event.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it represents a rare occurrence. Interstellar comets cross our solar system only a few times per century. The ATLAS project, which detected the comet, has been instrumental in tracking its movement and analyzing its composition. Observations show that the comet is exhibiting instability, with the potential for collapse in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2023.</li>
    <li>It is approaching perihelion, predicted for 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet's speed is currently 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>It has shown signs of instability, including fissures in its nucleus.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are collaborating on the study of this phenomenon.</li>
    <li>The comet is classified as the third interstellar comet known to science.</li>
    <li>Observatories in Hawaii and Chile are collecting data on 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2023 using telescopes from the ATLAS project. Since then, astronomers have monitored its trajectory and composition. Recent observations have indicated that the comet is increasingly unstable, with fissures appearing in its nucleus. The comet is expected to reach perihelion in 2026, presenting a crucial opportunity for scientific study as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>As it nears perihelion, 3I/ATLAS is undergoing significant changes due to solar heat. The heating process causes the comet's ice to sublimate, resulting in the release of gas and dust jets. This phenomenon raises concerns about the potential for fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The increasing proximity to the Sun accelerates the ice sublimation process, leading to structural destabilization of the nucleus,” said an astronomer involved in the monitoring of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The disintegration of an interstellar comet is a rarely documented phenomenon, providing a unique opportunity for real-time observation,” another expert noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior interstellar comets, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the composition and formation of celestial bodies outside our solar system. The study of 3I/ATLAS adds to this body of knowledge, as it is expected to reveal distinct chemical processes and formation conditions from its place of origin.</p>

<p>This current event emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring and research into interstellar objects, which are exceedingly rare and offer a unique glimpse into the universe's diversity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue throughout 2025, with a focus on its approach to perihelion. Astronomers aim to capture high-resolution images and detailed data regarding any fragmentation events that may occur, enhancing our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
