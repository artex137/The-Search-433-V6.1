      <h2>New 3I/ATLAS Rumours Claim Comet's Jets Angled Like Pyramids of Giza</h2>

<p>A new claim regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has sparked interest among astronomers and conspiracy theorists. The comet reportedly emitted seven visible jets while passing through the Solar System on 8 November 2025, leading to speculation that their formation resembles the angles of the Great Pyramids of Giza.</p>

<p>This observation matters as it raises questions about the nature of celestial phenomena and the potential connections between ancient architecture and cosmic events. Authorities, including astronomers, are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as they continue to gather data on its trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 8 November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Approximately 29 degrees from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Astronomers involved:</strong> M. Jager, G. Rhemann, and E. Prosperi</li>
    <li><strong>Halo size:</strong> Approximately 500,000 kilometres wide</li>
    <li><strong>Number of jets:</strong> At least seven distinct jets</li>
    <li><strong>Claimed angle match:</strong> Between 38° and 39° with pyramid slopes of 51°–52°</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 8 November 2025, astronomers captured images of 3I/ATLAS displaying multiple jets during its passage close to the Sun. The event occurred under bright moonlight conditions, allowing for detailed observations.</p>
<p>The jets were recorded as extending from the comet, with some directed toward the Sun. Following the event, David Sereda analyzed the image data and reported that the angles of the jets matched those of the Great Pyramids of Giza.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, noted, "The phenomenon may result from icy material erupting from the comet's nucleus," while cautioning that no direct evidence supports claims of an artificial mechanism.</blockquote>
<blockquote>David Sereda stated, "My calculations placed one jet pattern within the 'absolute tolerance' of Giza's architectural geometry," suggesting a possible connection between the comet and the ancient structures.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims surrounding 3I/ATLAS have drawn parallels to previous discussions about the relationship between celestial events and ancient human constructions. Similar debates have emerged in the past regarding other astronomical phenomena and their potential links to historical architecture.</p>
<p>While some support the notion of a connection, others argue that natural cometary activity can explain the observed jets without any deeper implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the inner Solar System. Further investigations into its jets and trajectory are expected, alongside ongoing discussions regarding the claims made about its alignment with the Great Pyramids of Giza.</p>
