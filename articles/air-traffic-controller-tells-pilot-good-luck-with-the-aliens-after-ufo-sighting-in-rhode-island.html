      <h2>Air Traffic Controller Tells Pilot 'Good Luck With The Aliens' After UFO Sighting In Rhode Island</h2>

<p>An air traffic controller in Rhode Island has gone viral after telling a pilot, “Good luck with the aliens,” during a recent UFO sighting. The incident took place while the pilot was flying a Piper PA-32RT-300T Turbo Lance II at an altitude of 3,500 feet, where he reported seeing an unidentified object near his plane.</p>

<p>This sighting has drawn attention as authorities have not provided a public comment regarding the object. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not yet released any statements about the reported UFO, which adds to ongoing discussions about unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The pilot reported the sighting while flying over Rhode Island at 3,500 feet. He described the object as a small silver canister that appeared to be hovering alongside his plane. After relaying this information to air traffic control, the controllers expressed surprise and asked for more details.
