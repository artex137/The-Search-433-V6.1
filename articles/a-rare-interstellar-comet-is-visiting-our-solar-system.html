      <h2>A Rare Interstellar Comet Is Visiting Our Solar System</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS is passing through our solar system, providing astronomers a unique opportunity to study it up close. The comet was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, part of a global network dedicated to scanning the night sky for moving objects.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, which were detected too late for detailed study, 3I/ATLAS is being closely monitored, allowing scientists to gather valuable data about its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First spotted: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: ATLAS telescope, Chile</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately 11 km (7 miles) wide</li>
    <li>Speed: About 209,000 km/h (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million km (170 million miles)</li>
    <li>Visibility: Through ground-based telescopes until September 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. Since then, astronomers have monitored its trajectory and characteristics. On September 7, 2025, two sky photographers captured an image of the comet, which appeared bright green, possibly due to rare chemicals released from its core as it approaches the Sun. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, and will reappear in early December, becoming visible in the morning sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “That might be the first time anyone has actually seen the light from an interstellar object with their own eyes,” said NASA astronomer Teddy Kareta, emphasizing the importance of patience in observing the comet.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the oldest interstellar comet ever observed, estimated to be about 7 billion years old. Its high carbon dioxide-to-water-ice ratio of about 8 to 1 suggests it originated from a star system different from our own, providing insights into the diversity of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. They expect to gather more images and data from ground-based observatories in the coming weeks, enhancing understanding of its properties and origins.</p>
