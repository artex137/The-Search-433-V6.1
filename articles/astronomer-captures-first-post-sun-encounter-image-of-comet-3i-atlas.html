      <h2>Astronomer captures first post-Sun encounter image of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reemerged from behind the Sun, with its first post-perihelion image captured on October 31, 2023, using the Lowell Observatory's Discovery Telescope in Arizona, US. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the comet's appearance.</p>

<p>The reappearance of 3I/ATLAS presents a significant opportunity for scientists to study the comet and gain insights into its composition. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, coming within 1.4 astronomical units of the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of image capture:</strong> October 31, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Lowell Observatory, Arizona, US</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 1.4 astronomical units</li>
    <li><strong>Comet speed:</strong> Over 130,000 mph</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 and has generated interest among scientists. On October 28, researcher Qicheng Zhang and his colleague posted a study indicating that the comet underwent rapid brightening and appeared bluer than the Sun before reaching its perihelion. The comet reached its closest distance to the Sun on October 29, and its first post-Sun encounter image was captured two days later.</p>

<p>In a blog post on November 1, Zhang noted that the comet might be visible with small telescopes, advising observers to look for it during morning twilight.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “All you need is a clear sky and a very low eastern horizon. It won't look very impressive, it's just a smudge, but it will be an increasingly visible smudge over the next few days,” said Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Lowell Observatory.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The reappearance of 3I/ATLAS is notable as it offers scientists a chance to study an interstellar visitor. While some speculate about the comet's origins, most astronomers believe it is a regular comet from an unknown star system in the Milky Way. The comet may be around 3 billion years older than the solar system, according to reports.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet moves away from the Sun, researchers expect to learn more about its makeup. Zhang anticipates that in about a week, the comet will be far enough from the Sun to be observed by larger telescopes worldwide, leading to an increase in studies on 3I/ATLAS.</p>
