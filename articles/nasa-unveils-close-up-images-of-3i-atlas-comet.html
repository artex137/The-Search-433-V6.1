      <h2>NASA unveils close-up images of 3I/ATLAS comet</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of Comet 3I/ATLAS, a celestial object from beyond our solar system, during a press conference at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, at 3 p.m. local time on November 19, 2025. The comet, which has sparked theories about its origins, has not caused any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as it counters recent conspiracy theories suggesting that the comet might be an alien spacecraft. NASA has stated that the lack of new images in the past three months was due to a US government shutdown that affected federal agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is about 190 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately seven miles wide.</li>
    <li>It is moving at about 209,000 kilometres per hour relative to the sun.</li>
    <li>NASA captured the new images using instruments on the ground and in space.</li>
    <li>At its closest approach on December 19, 2025, the comet will be nearly twice the distance of the sun from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass Jupiter on March 16, 2016.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, a NASA-funded project. Following its detection, NASA has monitored the comet, capturing various images that have led to speculation about its nature. On November 19, 2025, NASA officials presented new close-up images of the comet, dispelling some conspiracy theories regarding its origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Is the network of jets associated with pockets of ice on the surface of a natural cometary nucleus, or are they coming from a set of jet thrusters used for navigation of a spacecraft?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Apart from it being an interstellar object, there is nothing particularly unusual about 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third object from outside our solar system to be observed from Earth. Previous observations have shown unusual characteristics, such as the comet lacking a tail or exhibiting different colors. These observations have led some experts, like Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, to propose alternative theories regarding the comet's nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter and eventually exits the solar system. The public can expect further updates and images as the comet's trajectory evolves.</p>
