      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Shows Unusual Chemistry Ahead of Earth Flyby</h2>

<p>NASA and other observatories have been studying interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with the closest flyby set for December 19, 2025. Observations indicate a high carbon dioxide-to-water ratio in its coma, suggesting an unusual chemical composition. There have been no injuries or fatalities reported related to this event.</p>

<p>This study is significant because it allows scientists to compare material from another planetary system with comets formed in our solar system. NASA states that the comet poses no danger and will remain at a safe distance during the flyby.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometers).</li>
  <li>The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey.</li>
  <li>It is only the third known interstellar object confirmed to enter the solar system.</li>
  <li>The comet was moving at about 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 kilometers per hour) at discovery.</li>
  <li>NASA has utilized at least a dozen assets to gather data since the comet's discovery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first reported by the ATLAS survey on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, various space and ground-based telescopes initiated follow-up observations. The comet passed near Mars at about 19 million miles, allowing for significant image collection and ultraviolet data.</p>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provided infrared spectroscopy, revealing a coma dominated by carbon dioxide. Observations have continued as the comet approaches Earth, with significant data collection occurring in anticipation of the December 19 flyby.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The approach of 3I/ATLAS offers an unusually timely opportunity to study interstellar material with modern instruments,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Early results suggest a coma chemistry unlike most comets typically measured in the solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered the solar system, following previous discoveries that have provided insights into the chemical makeup of celestial bodies from beyond our solar system. This comet’s unique composition can help researchers understand how chemistry varies across different planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the December 19 flyby, observations will continue as the comet moves outward toward Jupiter's orbit in 2026. Researchers aim to refine models of comet chemistry and compare 3I/ATLAS with earlier interstellar objects.</p>
