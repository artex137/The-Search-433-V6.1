      <h2>NASA refutes claim that interstellar comet could be alien artifact threatening Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has dismissed a claim by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb that Comet 3I/ATLAS, which is set for a close encounter with Mars next month, might be an alien artifact posing a danger to humanity. Loeb suggested that the comet may have been deliberately sent by an advanced civilization. NASA officials assert that the object shows typical comet features and is not a threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights the ongoing search for extraterrestrial intelligence and the scientific community's response to speculative claims. NASA experts have provided clarifications regarding the comet's nature and trajectory, reassuring the public about its safety.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be up to <strong>3.5 miles</strong> (5.6 km) wide.</li>
    <li>It travels at <strong>130,000 mph</strong> (209,000 km/h), making it the fastest recorded visitor in the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass near Mars, Jupiter, and Venus, but will not approach Earth closer than <strong>170 million miles</strong> in the coming months.</li>
    <li>Loeb's theory was published in July, focusing on the comet's unusual trajectory and lack of typical cometary features.</li>
    <li>NASA's lead scientist for solar system small bodies, Tom Statler, has refuted the claims, stating the evidence supports the object being a natural comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July, Avi Loeb published a theory suggesting that Comet 3I/ATLAS might be an alien artifact. Following this, NASA conducted a review of the comet's characteristics and trajectory. NASA officials, including Tom Statler, have since publicly refuted the claims, asserting that the comet behaves like a typical comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object looks like a comet, performs comet-like activities, and closely resembles known comets in nearly every way,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The simplest hypothesis is that 3I/ATLAS is a comet,” Loeb acknowledged, stating that his suggestions were exercises to challenge established ideas.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding Comet 3I/ATLAS comes amid increasing interest in interstellar objects. Only three interstellar comets have been discovered to date, providing valuable data on the composition of other solar systems. This incident reflects the ongoing dialogue within the scientific community regarding the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars. The agency is prepared to gather more data, which may enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>
