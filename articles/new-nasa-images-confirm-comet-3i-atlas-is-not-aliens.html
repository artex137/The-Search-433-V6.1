      <h2>New NASA images confirm comet 3I/ATLAS is not aliens</h2>

<p>NASA has released the most detailed images to date of Comet 3I/ATLAS during a press conference on November 19, 2025. The comet, which is currently traversing our solar system, is only the third known interstellar object observed. NASA confirmed the icy rock poses no danger to Earth and is not an alien spacecraft, as some conspiracy theories have suggested.</p>

<p>This announcement is significant as it addresses misinformation surrounding the comet's appearance and characteristics. NASA officials, including Dr. Tom Statler, the lead scientist for solar system small bodies, emphasized the importance of understanding the universe and the scientific findings related to 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1.</li>
    <li>The comet reached a speed of approximately 153,000 miles per hour at its closest approach to the sun on October 30.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed within 19 million miles of Mars in October.</li>
    <li>The comet will not come closer than 170 million miles to Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA has used multiple spacecraft, including the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope, to image the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS observatory. The comet traveled at 137,000 miles per hour when first identified. As it approached the sun, its speed increased to 153,000 miles per hour, reaching its closest point to the sun on October 30.</p>

<p>In October, the comet flew within 19 million miles of Mars, allowing for close observation by NASA's MAVEN spacecraft. Following the flyby, NASA conducted a press conference on November 19, revealing new images and confirming details about the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It expanded people’s brains to think about how magical the universe could be,” said Dr. Tom Statler during the livestream announcement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It gives me goosebumps to think about, honestly… It’s a window into the deep past,” added Statler.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. The comet's icy nucleus and coma, a bright cloud of gas and dust, are consistent with typical comet characteristics. Recent misinformation about the comet's color change has been debunked, with experts clarifying that the appearance change was due to the brightening of the coma as it neared the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to gather data from ongoing satellite and space probe downlinks. The James Webb Space Telescope will be utilized as the primary tool for further study of 3I/ATLAS as it heads back into interstellar space.</p>
