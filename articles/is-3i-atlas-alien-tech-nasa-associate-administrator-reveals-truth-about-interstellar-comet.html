      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS Alien Tech? NASA Associate Administrator Reveals Truth About Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar traveler discovered in July by the ATLAS observatory in Chile, following a month-long government shutdown that hindered communications. The images were captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Parker Solar Probe during this period, showcasing the comet's nucleus in unprecedented detail.</p>

<p>This release marks a significant moment for both the scientific community and the public, as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to be studied. Its arrival offers valuable insights into the composition of celestial bodies from outside our solar system. NASA is now focused on analyzing the data collected and dispelling myths surrounding the comet's origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe captured images during the US government shutdown.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion, its closest point to the sun, on October 31, 2023.</li>
    <li>It will come closest to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>The MeerKAT telescope in South Africa detected the first radio signal from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS observatory in Chile. The comet's arrival coincided with a US government shutdown, which limited NASA's ability to share updates. On October 31, it reached perihelion, passing within 126 million miles of the sun. As of December 19, 2023, the comet will approach Earth at a distance of 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, NASA Associate Administrator, stated, "3I/ATLAS is a comet," emphasizing its natural origins despite speculation about alien technology.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Kshatriya explained that the detected signal corresponds with natural water jets from the comet's nucleus, which were heated by the sun.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the shutdown, NASA faced criticism for delays in data processing from prominent figures, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who highlighted the impact of bureaucracy on scientific discovery. Despite these challenges, the European Space Agency utilized existing Mars orbiters to track the comet and share findings during the blackout.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Researchers aim to compare its chemical composition with that of comets from our own Oort Cloud, enhancing our understanding of planetary system formation.</p>
