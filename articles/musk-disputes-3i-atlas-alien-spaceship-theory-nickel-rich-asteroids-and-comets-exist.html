      <h2>Musk disputes 3I/ATLAS alien spaceship theory: 'Nickel-rich asteroids and comets exist'</h2>

<p>SpaceX CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong> has recently discussed the interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> on Joe Rogan's podcast, disputing claims that it might be an alien spaceship due to its nickel content. Musk stated that the presence of nickel does not indicate a technological origin and emphasized the existence of nickel-rich asteroids and comets.</p>

<p>This discussion is significant in the ongoing debate about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Musk's remarks come as the comet continues to intrigue astronomers and the public alike. Authorities and scientists are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics as it emerges from the Sun's glare.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet 3I/ATLAS</strong> was discovered on <strong>July 1</strong>.</li>
    <li>Musk appeared on <strong>Joe Rogan's podcast</strong> to share his views.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at a speed of <strong>200,000 km/h</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be the size of <strong>Manhattan</strong>.</li>
    <li>It is believed to be <strong>7 to 14 billion years old</strong>.</li>
    <li>NASA's <strong>Artemis III</strong> mission is scheduled for <strong>mid-2027</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On <strong>July 1</strong>, 3I/ATLAS was discovered, marking it as an interstellar object of interest. Following its discovery, scientists began to observe its unusual characteristics, including its speed and brightness changes. In a recent podcast, Musk discussed 3I/ATLAS and shared his thoughts on the possibility of extraterrestrial life. He remarked on the implications of its nickel content and clarified his commitment to revealing any evidence of aliens if found.</p>

<p>Musk's comments have triggered discussions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential origins, as well as the broader implications for space exploration and tourism to the Moon, which he believes could become a reality.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If I have any evidence of aliens, I promise, I will come on your show and reveal it to you. I am never committing suicide. It's on camera, guys,” Musk said during the podcast.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There are cases of nickel-rich asteroids and comets,” Musk stated, emphasizing the natural explanations for the comet's characteristics.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing interest in interstellar objects, following the earlier discoveries of <strong>Oumuamua</strong> and <strong>Borisov</strong>. While Oumuamua was identified as a dark comet, Borisov was noted for its active nature. 3I/ATLAS's rapid movement and unusual features have led to speculation and investigation within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are set to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it fully emerges from the Sun's glare by <strong>mid-November</strong>. Further observations will help clarify its composition and trajectory, and may provide insights into its origins and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
