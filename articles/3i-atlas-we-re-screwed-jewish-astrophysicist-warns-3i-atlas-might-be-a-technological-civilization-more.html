      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Jewish astrophysicist warns of potential technological civilization</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project, has issued a stark warning about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a recent interview on FOX 10. Loeb stated that if the comet is of technological origin, “we’re screwed,” raising concerns about its implications for humanity. The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile and follows a hyperbolic trajectory, passing through our solar system only once.</p>

<p>This warning comes amid increased interest in the behaviors and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb’s remarks highlight the potential risks posed by the comet, which travels at approximately 244,800 km/h, making it three times faster than the fastest human-made rocket. Authorities, including NASA, are currently working on releasing high-resolution images of the comet, which have faced delays due to bureaucratic issues related to a recent government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Travels at approximately 244,800 km/h, three times faster than the fastest rocket.</li>
    <li>Loeb’s comments made during an interview on FOX 10.</li>
    <li>NASA plans to release high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS soon, pending government reopening.</li>
    <li>Loeb outlined ten anomalies suggesting 3I/ATLAS may not be a natural comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS is discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Since its discovery, interest has grown regarding its unusual trajectory and characteristics. In a recent interview on FOX 10, Avi Loeb warns of the potential risks posed by 3I/ATLAS if it is indeed of technological origin. Following Loeb's comments, Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has engaged with NASA to expedite the release of data and images related to the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it’s technological, yes… we’re screwed,” said Avi Loeb during his FOX 10 interview.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“As soon as the government reopens, they’ll be releasing images and data,” said Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna regarding NASA's plans.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community remains divided on the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Some experts believe it is a natural interstellar comet, while others, including Loeb, suggest it may be a piece of extraterrestrial technology. Loeb has pointed to ten specific anomalies that differentiate 3I/ATLAS from known comets, raising questions about its origin and purpose.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to release high-resolution images and data of 3I/ATLAS once the government reopens. Meanwhile, scientists will continue to study the comet's unique characteristics and trajectory to better understand its nature and any implications for Earth.</p>
