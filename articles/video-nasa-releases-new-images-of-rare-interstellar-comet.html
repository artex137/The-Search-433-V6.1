      <h2>NASA releases new images of rare interstellar comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of the rare interstellar comet known as 3I/Atlas, which is currently passing through our solar system. The images were shared on November 19, 2025, showcasing this unique celestial object that is only the third confirmed comet to originate from another star.</p>

<p>The release of these images has heightened interest among astronomers and space enthusiasts. Authorities at NASA are encouraging the public to observe the comet as it travels through space, providing an opportunity to study its characteristics and behavior. David Jewitt, a professor of astronomy at UCLA, has emphasized the significance of this event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Date of Image Release: November 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Origin: The comet is the third confirmed object from another star to visit our solar system.</li>
    <li>Notable Expert: David Jewitt, professor of astronomy at UCLA, discussed the comet's significance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first identified by astronomers as it entered the solar system. Following its discovery, NASA monitored its trajectory and characteristics. On November 19, 2025, NASA released new images of the comet, furthering public interest and scientific inquiry.</p>

<blockquote>“3I/Atlas is a fascinating object that allows us to learn more about the origins of comets and the conditions of other solar systems,” said David Jewitt, professor of astronomy at UCLA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare occurrences, with 3I/Atlas being only the third confirmed instance. Previous interstellar objects, such as Oumuamua and Borisov, have also provided insights into the nature of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. The study of these comets helps scientists understand the diversity of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/Atlas as it travels through the solar system. Scientists will analyze data collected from the comet to gain further insights into its composition and behavior.</p>
