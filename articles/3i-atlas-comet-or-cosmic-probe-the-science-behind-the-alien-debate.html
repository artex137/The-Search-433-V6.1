      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Comet or Cosmic Probe? The Science Behind the Alien Debate</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object, has entered our solar system, igniting a fierce scientific debate since its discovery in July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS survey. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, prompting Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb to propose the possibility of it being alien technology. NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet, supported by recent observations and data.</p>

<p>This debate is significant as it challenges our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. NASA is actively monitoring 3I/ATLAS and has released data from multiple observatories to support its classification as a comet, countering claims of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS survey</li>
    <li>Reached perihelion: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Excess velocity: 52 km/s</li>
    <li>First radio signals detected: November 11, 2025, by South Africa’s MeerKAT telescope</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed comet status on November 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Future imaging planned by New Horizons in 2026 at 10 AU</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the NASA ATLAS survey. It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, leading to speculation about its nature. On November 11, 2025, MeerKAT captured the first radio signals, further informing the debate. NASA held a briefing on November 19, 2025, where officials reinforced the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet, presenting data from various observatories.</p>

<p>Throughout this period, Avi Loeb has continued to advocate for the interpretation of 3I/ATLAS as a potential probe, citing its unusual characteristics. However, NASA's findings have consistently leaned towards a natural explanation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a comet,” emphasized NASA officials, dismissing rumors of extraterrestrial origins.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The implication of alien technology would be huge and therefore we must take it seriously,” Loeb told Newsweek ahead of perihelion.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the earlier interstellar objects ‘Oumuamua (1I) and Borisov (2I), which have also sparked discussions regarding their origins and nature. The scientific community is divided on the interpretation of such objects, with some advocating for rigorous evidence to support extraordinary claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory past Jupiter in 2026, NASA and other observatories will gather more data. The ongoing debate between proponents of its natural origins and those suggesting artificial engineering will likely persist, influencing future research on interstellar objects.</p>
