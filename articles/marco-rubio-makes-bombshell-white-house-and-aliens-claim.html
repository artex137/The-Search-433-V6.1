      <h2>Marco Rubio Claims Government Has Hidden Truth About Aliens</h2>

<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has claimed that rogue elements within the government have concealed information about contact with aliens for decades. This assertion emerged during the promotion of the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, which began streaming on Prime Video on November 21, 2025.</p>

<p>This revelation matters as it raises questions about transparency in government and the ongoing investigations into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). The Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has documented over 1,600 sightings of UAP, and Rubio's comments may influence public perception and policy regarding UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> November 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Documentary:</strong> <em>The Age of Disclosure</em></li>
    <li><strong>Secretary of State:</strong> Marco Rubio</li>
    <li><strong>Reported sightings:</strong> Over 1,600 UAP logged by the Pentagon</li>
    <li><strong>Public hearings:</strong> Three conducted by US Congress over the past three years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 21, 2025, the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> was released, alleging the presence of alien intelligence on Earth. Following this, Marco Rubio made public claims about government cover-ups regarding extraterrestrial contact. This coincided with ongoing discussions about UAP in Congress and the Pentagon.</p>

<p>In recent years, the US Congress has held three public hearings featuring testimony from military personnel about encounters with UFOs, some of which reportedly defy the laws of physics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities – and it’s not ours,” said Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It says a lot about what’s been hidden from everyone for so long,” said Dr. Bill Birnes, co-author of the book <em>UFOs and the White House</em>.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Over the past four years, UFOs have gained prominence in public discourse, with the Pentagon's UAP office logging a significant number of sightings. The US Congress has taken steps to investigate these phenomena through public hearings, which have included testimony from both retired and active military personnel.</p>

<p>Jay Stratton, a former director of the UAP Task Force, has claimed to have witnessed a non-human craft and being, contributing to the ongoing conversation about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP sightings are set to continue, with the Pentagon and Congress expected to further examine the implications of Rubio's claims and the broader topic of extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
