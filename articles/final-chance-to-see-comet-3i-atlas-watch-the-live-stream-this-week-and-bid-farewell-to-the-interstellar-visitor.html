      <h2>Final chance to see comet 3I/ATLAS. Watch the live stream this week and bid farewell to the interstellar visitor</h2>

<p>A group of astronomers has announced that their final live stream of comet 3I/ATLAS will take place on Thursday, 22 January 2026, at 23:00 UTC. The comet is approaching opposition, meaning it will be directly opposite the Sun from Earth's perspective, making this the best time for viewing.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the last opportunity for the public to observe 3I/ATLAS before it exits the Solar System. The comet, discovered on 1 July 2025, has fascinated scientists and the public alike due to its interstellar origin—formed outside our Solar System. The astronomers at the Virtual Telescope Project 2.0 have hosted numerous live feeds since its discovery, allowing people to view the comet without needing their own telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> Thursday, 22 January 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Live Stream Start Time:</strong> 23:00 UTC</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Opposition Date:</strong> 22 January 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Visible With:</strong> Telescopes throughout January 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Live Stream Platform:</strong> Virtual Telescope Project 2.0 YouTube channel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory and made numerous observations. The comet will reach opposition on 22 January 2026, providing the best viewing opportunity for observers on Earth.</p>
<p>The astronomers at the Virtual Telescope Project 2.0 have conducted various live feeds, allowing the public to engage with the comet during its visibility period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This could be the opportunity you've been waiting for,” said a representative from the Virtual Telescope Project 2.0, regarding the final live stream of 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three interstellar objects ever discovered. Its journey through our Solar System has captivated not only astronomers but also the general public. The comet's visibility has allowed for unprecedented observations, including images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, the Very Large Telescope, and the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After the final live stream on 22 January 2026, 3I/ATLAS will exit the Solar System and will not return, marking the end of its visibility and the opportunity for further observation.</p>
