      <h2>Symmetrical structure in 3I/ATLAS object challenges astronomy and generates theories about technological origin</h2>

<p>Space telescopes have recorded detailed images of comet 3I/ATLAS in January 2026, revealing unprecedented features that challenge current astronomical understanding. The celestial body, discovered by the ATLAS system, exhibits a configuration of jets that diverges from typical comet behavior, causing researchers to question its physical nature.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may redefine the understanding of interstellar bodies. Researchers, including those from Harvard, are investigating the implications of the comet's unusual characteristics. The findings have reignited discussions about the possibility of an artificial origin, although most astronomers classify it as a natural, metal-rich comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Identified by the ATLAS system.</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Date:</strong> Images taken on January 14, 2026.</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Passage:</strong> Occurred in October 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>Next Close Encounter:</strong> Expected with Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li><strong>Orbital Inclination:</strong> Less than 5 degrees relative to the Solar System's plane.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Magnitude:</strong> Estimated at 16.7.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS system and has been under intense observation since its initial detection. Its perihelion, the closest approach to the sun, occurred in October 2025. Recent images captured on January 14, 2026, revealed distinctive jets of material, prompting further analysis and speculation about its origin. The comet is set to pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026, which will provide additional data for scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The perfect symmetry of the jets has surprised analysts, raising questions about the natural processes involved,” said a researcher from Harvard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While the data supports the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a comet, its behavior is unlike anything we have seen before,” a NASA spokesperson noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, interstellar objects such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov have been documented, but 3I/ATLAS presents unique features that challenge existing models of comet formation. The debate over its potential artificial origin highlights the ongoing conversation in the astrophysics community regarding the nature of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the upcoming close encounter with Jupiter, researchers will continue to analyze data from the comet. The alignment of 3I/ATLAS with the sun and Earth at the end of January 2026 will provide a critical opportunity for observations that may clarify the nature of its jets.</p>
