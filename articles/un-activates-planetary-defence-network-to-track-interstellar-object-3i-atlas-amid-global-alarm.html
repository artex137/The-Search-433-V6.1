      <h2>UN Activates Planetary Defence Network to Track Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Amid Global Alarm</h2>

<p>The United Nations has mobilised a global planetary-defence initiative to track interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is set to pass Earth at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometres. NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no danger to Earth, but its unusual origin and behaviour have raised public interest and concern.</p>

<p>This initiative aims to test the world's preparedness for potential cosmic threats. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), under the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), is leading the campaign to track 3I/ATLAS and improve global readiness for such interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest approach to the Sun on 30 October 2025, at about 1.4 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest distance to Earth will be approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The campaign is the first UN-backed observational effort for an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency emphasised the necessity of international cooperation for data collection and analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile detected 3I/ATLAS, confirming its hyperbolic orbit and high velocity. NASA has stated that the comet will reach perihelion on 30 October 2025, which places it just inside Mars's orbit. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed unusual comet-like activity, including a gas-filled coma with a high carbon dioxide ratio.</p>

<p>In response to these findings, the IAWN has initiated a coordinated planetary-defence campaign to monitor 3I/ATLAS and assess Earth's readiness for similar cosmic events.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We shouldn’t wait for a dangerous object to learn how we’ll respond—that would be too late,” said an official at the Planetary Defence Coordination Office.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The collection and analysis of near-Earth object data is a matter of global common interest,” stated the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS highlights growing concerns about global readiness for space-impact events beyond familiar asteroid threats. Many countries, particularly in the Global South, lack sufficient infrastructure for monitoring and responding to such threats. The planned International Year of Asteroid Awareness and Planetary Defence in 2029 aims to enhance preparedness and collaboration among nations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories worldwide are preparing to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Key milestones will occur on the perihelion date in October 2025, followed by further monitoring in December 2025 and early 2026.</p>
