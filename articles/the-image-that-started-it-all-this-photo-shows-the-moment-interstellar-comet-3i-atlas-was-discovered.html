      <h2>The image that started it all... This photo shows the moment interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor from beyond our Solar System, was discovered in June 2025 by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) project, which is funded by NASA and developed by the University of Hawaii. The discovery marks a significant moment in astronomy, as this comet offers insights into the composition of objects from other star systems.</p>

<p>Authorities have noted that studying 3I/ATLAS can enhance our understanding of how interstellar bodies compare to those within our own solar system. Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have already revealed the presence of water ice and various gases, suggesting similarities between 3I/ATLAS and comets formed in our system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: June 2025</li>
    <li>Discovery Agency: ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System)</li>
    <li>Funding: NASA</li>
    <li>Telescopes Used: ATLAS system (four telescopes in total: two in Hawaii, one in Chile, one in South Africa)</li>
    <li>Observation Tools: James Webb Space Telescope, Very Large Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope</li>
    <li>Current Status: Approaching the Sun, Earth, and Mars in autumn 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile first reported the discovery of 3I/ATLAS. This comet, originating from interstellar space, was detected using an automated system that captures and compares images of the night sky. The technique, known as 'blinking,' identifies moving objects against the static background of stars.</p>

<p>Following its discovery, astronomers have directed some of the world's most powerful telescopes towards 3I/ATLAS to gather more data. As the comet moves closer to the inner solar system, additional observations from spacecraft such as Mars rovers and NASA's Juno mission are anticipated.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS offers a unique opportunity to study the composition of interstellar objects and how they compare to those found within our solar system,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS comes during a time of increased interest in interstellar objects. Prior discoveries of such comets, including ‘Oumuamua’ in 2017, have sparked discussions about the nature of these celestial bodies and their origins. Ongoing advancements in telescope technology and survey methods promise to unveil more interstellar visitors in the future.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun and other planets, astronomers plan to continue their observations. Future surveys, including those by the Vera Rubin Telescope, aim to identify and study more interstellar objects, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of the cosmos.</p>
