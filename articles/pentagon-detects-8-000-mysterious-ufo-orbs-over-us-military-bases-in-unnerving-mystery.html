      <h2>Pentagon detects 8,000 mysterious UFO orbs over US military bases in unnerving mystery</h2>

<p>A report from the crowdsourced UFO-sighting app Enigma has revealed over 8,000 reports of unidentified metallic orbs in the United States, primarily observed near military installations in California, New York, and Arizona, between December 2022 and June 2025.</p>

<p>This development raises concerns about national security and the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is currently investigating these sightings, having logged 757 cases from May 2023 to June 2024, with 21 classified as unresolved.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Over 8,000 reports of UFOs logged in the U.S. between December 2022 and June 2025.</li>
    <li>422 reports specifically describe metallic orbs, mostly observed between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m.</li>
    <li>360 sightings occurred within five miles of military bases, including Fort Hamilton, Papago Military Reserve, and Los Angeles Air Force Base.</li>
    <li>AARO reported 757 cases of UAP between May 2023 and June 2024.</li>
    <li>43% of reports mentioned lights, 40% noted low flying, and 35% described rapid movement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between December 2022 and June 2025, Enigma users reported more than 8,000 UFO sightings, with 422 detailing metallic orbs. The majority of these sightings occurred near military installations during late-night hours.</p>

<p>From May 2023 to June 2024, the AARO documented 757 UAP cases, with 21 remaining unresolved. A notable video of a metallic sphere was presented by Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, former head of the AARO, taken by an MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicle.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While classic disc-shaped UFOs dominated mid-20th century sightings, orb-shaped UAP have emerged as one of the most frequently reported modern phenomena on Enigma,” the report stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Despite official statements and competing theories, their origin and purpose remain unknown,” it added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This report highlights a shift in UFO sightings from traditional disc shapes to orb formations, which are increasingly spotted near sensitive infrastructure. The AARO's ongoing investigations reflect a growing interest in understanding these phenomena, as many reports indicate potential surveillance capabilities.</p>

<p>Various theories have emerged regarding the nature of these orbs, ranging from surveillance devices to psychological manifestations, but definitive conclusions remain elusive.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO continues to investigate these sightings, focusing on identifying the origin and purpose of the metallic orbs. Further analysis of the reported incidents is expected as authorities seek to clarify the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
