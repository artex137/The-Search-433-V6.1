      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Shines Bright: Object Is Spewing Gas And Dust After Sun Pass</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently making its closest approach to Earth, scheduled for December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometres (170 million miles). The interstellar comet, discovered in late June and confirmed in July, is actively emitting gas and dust following its recent pass around the sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study direct materials from another star system. Space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are taking advantage of this moment to gather and analyze data on the comet's composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is travelling at a speed of 210,000 kilometres per hour (130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be between 440 metres (1,400 feet) and 5.6 kilometres (3.5 miles) across.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA have released clear images showing the comet's activity.</li>
    <li>A dozen spacecraft have been repurposed to observe the comet.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope captured a notable image on November 30, 2023, from a distance of 286 million kilometres (178 million miles).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in late June 2023 and confirmed in July as the third known interstellar object. It has since traversed our solar system, passing close to Mars and the sun in October. The comet is now preparing for its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<p>NASA and ESA released images of the comet's bright activity this week, showcasing its gas and dust emissions. The Hubble Space Telescope captured a significant image on November 30, 2023, providing insight into the comet's structure and dynamics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This dramatic activity is precisely why the object is 'shining bright' and generating such huge scientific interest,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its interstellar origin but also for its size, which may make it the largest interstellar object detected to date. The scientific community has mobilized an extensive observational effort, repurposing various spacecraft to gather data on this unique celestial body.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The observational campaign will culminate with the closest flyby on December 19, 2023. The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to provide additional images and measurements during this critical phase of study.</p>
