      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Solar System</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, officially designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is currently traversing the solar system after being discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. The comet is not expected to cause any injuries or fatalities as it follows a hyperbolic orbit and will pass safely away from Earth.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Scientists are closely monitoring its trajectory and physical characteristics to gain insights into extrasolar cometary formation and the dynamics of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Current Distance from Sun:</strong> 1.36 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Current Distance from Earth:</strong> 2.3 AU (approximately 344 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29, 2025, at 11:15 UT</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum Speed:</strong> 68.3 km/s at perihelion</li>
    <li><strong>Upcoming Closest Approaches:</strong> 0.65 AU from Venus on November 3, 1.8 AU from Earth on December 19, and 0.35 AU from Jupiter on March 16, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was initially discovered on July 1, 2025, and its interstellar status was confirmed by the Minor Planet Center on July 2, 2025, based on its hyperbolic orbit. Precovery observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite showed early cometary activity as far back as May 7, 2025. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, and is now on an outbound trajectory.</p>
<p>As of October 30, 2025, it is approximately 1.36 AU from the Sun and 2.3 AU from Earth. It is expected to pass 0.65 AU from Venus on November 3, 2025, and 1.8 AU from Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The gravitational pull from the Sun accelerates 3I/ATLAS, but its high velocity ensures it will not be captured,” said a representative from the Minor Planet Center.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered the solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique composition and trajectory provide valuable data for researchers studying the origins and characteristics of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it makes its closest approaches to various celestial bodies. Future studies may refine estimates of interstellar object populations and explore possibilities for spacecraft intercepts to sample its materials.</p>
