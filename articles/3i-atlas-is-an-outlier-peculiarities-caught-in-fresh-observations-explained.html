      <h2>3I/ATLAS is an outlier: Peculiarities caught in fresh observations explained</h2>

<p>Fresh observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have revealed unusual features, adding to its list of anomalies since its discovery on July 1. The comet's strange behavior has raised questions among scientists and sparked interest within the astronomical community following its recent flyby of Mars in early October.</p>

<p>This matters because the peculiar characteristics of 3I/ATLAS challenge existing knowledge about comet behavior and formation. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are closely monitoring the comet's activity and conducting further studies to understand its unique properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Recent flyby of Mars occurred in early October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Perseverance rover captured images of a cylindrical object near Mars.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is losing water at a rate of approximately 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>At least 8% of the comet's surface is active, compared to 3% - 5% for typical comets.</li>
    <li>Observations made by the American Astronomical Society using NASA's TESS from May 7 to June 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Notable nickel emissions detected on August 24, 2025, at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was officially discovered on July 1, 2025. Observations from NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in July and August revealed the comet releasing water at a significant rate. In early October, the comet flew by Mars, captured in images by the Perseverance rover, which showed an unusual cylindrical object. The European Space Agency later released images from its ExoMars orbiter, highlighting a bright coma but no visible tail.</p>

<p>On October 15, researchers flagged a prominent nickel emission from the comet based on observations made at the Keck Observatory on August 24. This discovery raised further questions about the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This dot is the centre of the comet, comprising its icy-rocky nucleus and its surrounding coma,” said the European Space Agency regarding the images taken by ExoMars.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The production rate of nickel relative to cyanide is higher than in 2I/Borisov and orders of magnitude above the solar system comet median,” the authors of the study noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, comets were generally understood to follow specific patterns of behavior, including the presence of long tails as they approach the Sun. The unique features of 3I/ATLAS, including its lack of a typical tail and high activity levels, challenge these established norms.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, have shown distinct behaviors, but 3I/ATLAS's emissions and structural anomalies mark it as a significant outlier in cometary studies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its behavior and composition. Upcoming observations and analyses will aim to provide insights into the comet's unique features and their implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
