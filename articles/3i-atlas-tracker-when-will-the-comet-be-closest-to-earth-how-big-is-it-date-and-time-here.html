      <h2>3I/ATLAS comet approaches Earth</h2>  
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units, which is approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometers). The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at 11:47.</p>  

<p>This rare comet is only the third confirmed interstellar object after 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Astronomers are studying its hyperbolic trajectory and unique chemical properties. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, as its orbit is unbound to the Sun.</p>  

<h2>Key facts</h2>  
<ul>  
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (170 million miles or 270 million kilometers)</li>  
    <li><strong>Closest point to Sun:</strong> October 29, 2025, at 11:47</li>  
    <li><strong>Diameter of nucleus:</strong> Estimated between 440 meters (1,444 feet) and 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles)</li>  
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Currently visible in the Northern Hemisphere with a small telescope (magnitude 12-14)</li>  
    <li><strong>ESA's Juice spacecraft:</strong> Monitoring 3I/ATLAS while en route to Jupiter</li>  
</ul>  

<h2>Timeline</h2>  
<p>3I/ATLAS has been traveling through the solar system, reaching its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2025. The comet is currently outbound and visible from the Northern Hemisphere. It will reappear after solar conjunction in late November 2025.</p>  
<p>The comet is expected to pass Earth safely in December 2025, with its trajectory confirmed to be hyperbolic and unbound to the Sun.</p>  

<h2>Official statements</h2>  
<blockquote>  
    "3I/ATLAS poses no threat. Its closest Earth pass is safer than Mars' orbit," said NASA.  
</blockquote>  
<blockquote>  
    "The comet will exit the solar system post-perihelion," confirmed ESA.  
</blockquote>  

<h2>Context</h2>  
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of the few interstellar objects observed in our solar system. Previous objects, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have also sparked significant interest among astronomers and the public alike. Studies of these comets provide insights into the composition of materials in other solar systems.</p>  

<h2>What’s next</h2>  
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observations will be conducted using various telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, to gather more data about its properties and trajectory.</p>
