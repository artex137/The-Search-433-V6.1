      <h2>Watch: Flight landing at Cork Airport spots strange, 'fast-moving UFO' in the sky</h2>

<p>Stargazers across County Cork have reported sightings of a strange, 'fast-moving UFO' in the night sky on October 29, 2025. The bizarre lights have sparked widespread interest on social media, but there have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the sightings.</p>

<p>The phenomenon has drawn attention from local meteorologist Alan O'Reilly, who noted a surge in notifications about the sightings on his social media account. Authorities are investigating the reports, with many commenters offering rational explanations for the lights, including the possibility of rocket fuel from a recent launch.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: County Cork, Ireland</li>
    <li>Time of rocket launch: 4:35 PM Irish time</li>
    <li>Rocket: SpaceX Falcon 9</li>
    <li>Payload: Starlink satellites</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, reports of a 'fast-moving UFO' began to surface across social media in County Cork. Alan O'Reilly, a weather expert, shared a video of the sighting, describing it as a "big object with a light in front but no noise and moving very quickly."</p>
<p>At approximately 4:35 PM that same day, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, carrying Starlink satellites. This launch has been suggested as a possible explanation for the reported lights.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Notifications lit up with people flagging sightings,” said Alan O'Reilly, commenting on the influx of reports he received.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It looked triangular in shape with the bottom of the triangle looking quite bright,” said a follower who shared a photo from a flight into Cork Airport.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first instance of UFO sightings related to SpaceX activities in the region. Earlier in 2025, residents reported "strange UFO fires" over the Southside of Cork, which were also linked to rocket launches. These occurrences have led to speculation and concern among the public regarding the nature of these sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor the situation and investigate the recent sightings, while experts will assess the connection to the SpaceX launch. Further updates are expected as more information becomes available.</p>
