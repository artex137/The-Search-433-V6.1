      <h2>Mysterious Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Nears Sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, only the third known interstellar object, is nearing its closest point to the Sun, reaching perihelion on October 29, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in Chile, the comet travels at an extraordinary speed of 58 km/s and is expected to pass Earth at a distance of approximately 1.8 AU in December 2025.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study a celestial object from beyond our solar system. The comet is believed to be about 7–11 billion years old, potentially making it the oldest comet ever observed. Researchers are mobilizing telescopes worldwide to gather data on its composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion: October 29, 2025, at approximately 1.36 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at about 1.8 AU (270 million km).</li>
    <li>Speed: 58 km/s (~130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>Estimated size: Up to 5.6 km in diameter.</li>
    <li>Age: Estimated between 7–11 billion years, possibly the oldest comet observed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS as it approached the solar system, marking it as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic trajectory. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, swooping inside Mars' orbit. It remained hidden from Earth due to solar glare during this close approach.</p>
<p>In early December 2025, 3I/ATLAS will make its closest pass to Earth, but it will still be too faint to see without a telescope.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is an object from a part of the galaxy we’ve never seen up close before,” said astronomer Matthew Hopkins of Oxford. “It offers scientists another rare chance to study a piece of a distant star system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of two other interstellar objects: 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These prior encounters were brief, but 3I/ATLAS presents a longer opportunity for observation and study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Telescope networks globally will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the inner solar system. Upcoming observations from ESA’s JUICE probe and NASA’s Psyche spacecraft are planned as the comet approaches perihelion.</p>
