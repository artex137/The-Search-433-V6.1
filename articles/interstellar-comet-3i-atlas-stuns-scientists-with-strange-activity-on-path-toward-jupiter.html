      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Stuns Scientists With Strange Activity on Path Toward Jupiter</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, is exhibiting unusual behaviour as it travels toward Jupiter, prompting intense scrutiny from scientists. Discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, the comet is currently on a hyperbolic trajectory that confirms its origin outside our solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing models of cometary physics. As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter's orbit in March 2026, researchers will have a unique opportunity to study its characteristics and determine whether it behaves like typical comets or exhibits anomalies that could reshape understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is travelling at speeds exceeding <strong>130,000 miles</strong> (<strong>209,000 kilometres</strong>) per hour.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Jupiter is expected on <strong>16 March 2026</strong>.</li>
    <li>NASA's missions, including STEREO-A and SOHO, have captured images of the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet displays a high ratio of carbon dioxide to water vapour.</li>
    <li>Ground-based telescopes have detected emissions of nickel and cyanide gas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025, marking it as the third confirmed interstellar object. NASA and other space agencies have since monitored its trajectory and behaviour. Observations between July and September 2025 revealed unusual jet activity and chemical signatures, prompting further analysis.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches Jupiter, scientists plan to use instruments aboard NASA's Juno spacecraft and Earth-based telescopes to gather more data. The closest approach on 16 March 2026 will be a pivotal moment for researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS presents an unparalleled chance to study material formed outside our own star system,” said Tom Statler, lead scientist for small bodies at NASA, during a briefing on the comet's observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its discovery adds to the growing body of research on interstellar visitors and their implications for understanding the formation of planetary systems.</p>

<p>While most scientists agree on its natural origin, some, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, express skepticism regarding certain characteristics of the comet, suggesting they may not align with typical natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, researchers will monitor its interactions with Jupiter's gravity and particle environment during its closest approach in March 2026. This opportunity may provide crucial insights into the comet's structure and behaviour, contributing to the scientific understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
