      <h2>Avi Loeb stands firm with 3I/ATLAS: "The Vatican's insistence did not change the Earth's orbit"</h2>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has asserted that Comet 3I/ATLAS is not a comet but rather a technological object, claiming it will release artificial satellites near Jupiter. Loeb made his comments in a recent article, emphasizing his disagreement with NASA and the prevailing scientific consensus.</p>

<p>This assertion matters because it challenges established astronomical beliefs and raises questions about the interpretation of data from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Loeb alleges that JPL altered its data following his communication, which he views as an attempt to undermine his findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Claim:</strong> Technological object, not a comet</li>
    <li><strong>Professor:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li><strong>Data change:</strong> JPL adjusted trajectory data after an email from Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Likelihood of trajectory match:</strong> 1 in 26,000</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has maintained his position on 3I/ATLAS, arguing that it is poised to approach Jupiter to deploy artificial satellites. He calculated that the trajectory of the object aligns with Jupiter's Hill radius, a point where the planet's gravity can capture objects. Following his email to NASA’s Davide Farnoccia regarding the object's trajectory, Loeb observed that JPL revised its data to suggest that 3I/ATLAS would not enter this critical area.</p>

<p>Loeb has described the adjustments made by JPL as inadequate, stating that they do not sufficiently account for the complexities of the object's trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The insistence of the Vatican that the Earth is at the center of the solar system did not change the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. For the same reason, the new model of JPL Horizons will not change the actual trajectory of 3I/ATLAS."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb added, "Any small satellite deposited outside this radius will be ejected from Jupiter by solar gravity."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb's claims have sparked debate within the scientific community. Previous comments regarding celestial objects have often led to polarized opinions, especially when they challenge long-standing views. The process of data interpretation in astronomy remains a critical aspect of research, where differing models can lead to significant discrepancies in conclusions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb's assertions may prompt further investigation into the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and the validity of the data provided by NASA. It remains to be seen if additional studies will be conducted to evaluate the implications of Loeb's findings on our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
