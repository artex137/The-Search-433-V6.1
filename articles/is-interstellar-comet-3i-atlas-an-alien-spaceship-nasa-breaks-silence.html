      <h2>Is interstellar comet 3I/Atlas an alien spaceship? Nasa breaks silence</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, recently observed by various space missions, is between 5 to 8 billion years old. This discovery was announced by US Congressman George Whitesides of the House Science Committee on November 20, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet, which was discovered on July 1, 2025.</p>

<p>The significance of this comet lies in its age and the insights it may provide about the conditions in distant planetary systems. NASA has initiated a solar system-wide observation campaign involving a fleet of twelve assets, including spacecraft and telescopes, to study 3I/Atlas as it travels through the inner Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 5 to 8 billion years.</li>
    <li>Passed near Mars at a distance of approximately 19 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured close images of the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its extrasolar origins.</li>
    <li>This comet is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, interstellar comet 3I/Atlas was discovered. Following its discovery, NASA coordinated a comprehensive observation campaign utilizing a fleet of twelve spacecraft and telescopes. In fall 2025, the comet passed near Mars, where NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured detailed images and data.</p>

<p>Congressman Whitesides highlighted the potential risks posed by interstellar objects, noting that if a comet of 3I/Atlas's size were on a collision course with Earth, humanity might have only two months to devise a deflection strategy.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no evidence supporting online rumors that the comet is an alien spaceship passing through our Solar System,” said Congressman George Whitesides.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3IATLAS's composition, trajectory, and activity levels are providing clues about conditions in alien star systems billions of years ago,” added Whitesides.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our Solar System, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such ancient comets offers a rare opportunity to understand the evolution of cosmic bodies beyond our immediate celestial neighborhood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and partner observatories will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas, gathering data to enhance scientific understanding of interstellar objects and their origins as the comet progresses through the Solar System.</p>
