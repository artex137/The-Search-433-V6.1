      <h2>Brian Cox addresses 'alien spaceship' theories surrounding Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Brian Cox has criticized theories claiming that Comet 3I/ATLAS could be an 'alien spaceship', sharing what he calls 'reliable' sources on the subject. Cox's comments follow recent speculation about the interstellar object, which was first detected by NASA on 1 July 2023.</p>

<p>This topic has gained traction due to the unique characteristics of Comet 3I/ATLAS, which astronomers have confirmed is not from our solar system. NASA has stated that the comet poses 'no threat to Earth' and will remain at a safe distance. However, Harvard University theoretical physicist Avi Loeb has raised concerns, suggesting that the comet could be a 'potentially hostile' alien craft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected by NASA on 1 July 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed it is not from our solar system.</li>
    <li>Loeb estimates a 30 to 40 per cent chance it is not a 'naturally formed' object.</li>
    <li>Cox describes the comet as composed of carbon dioxide, water ices, and other materials.</li>
    <li>Cox has called for reliance on peer-reviewed sources for information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2023, NASA first detected Comet 3I/ATLAS and confirmed its interstellar origin. The comet has since attracted attention for its unusual properties. On 1 November 2023, Brian Cox publicly addressed the speculation surrounding the comet, responding to claims made by Avi Loeb and others.</p>

<p>Loeb has suggested that the comet could be a technological artefact with 'active intelligence', ranking it a four on his scale of potential extraterrestrial origin. Cox responded by emphasizing the natural characteristics of the comet and its expected orbit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff. It is entirely natural in origin, its orbit is as expected, and it will whizz around the sun and then disappear off into the galaxy again.” 
    <br/>— Brian Cox
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “If it ever encounters another inhabited solar system in the far future I hope the living things there are more sensible than us and enjoy it for what it is - a visitor from elsewhere in the galaxy.” 
    <br/>— Brian Cox
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding Comet 3I/ATLAS reflects a broader trend of fascination with interstellar objects and their origins. Previous incidents of speculation regarding unidentified flying objects have led to increased scrutiny and interest in scientific explanations. The debate highlights the importance of relying on credible scientific research to understand astronomical phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue as astronomers monitor its trajectory and characteristics. Experts encourage the public to seek out peer-reviewed research for accurate information regarding the comet and its implications.</p>
