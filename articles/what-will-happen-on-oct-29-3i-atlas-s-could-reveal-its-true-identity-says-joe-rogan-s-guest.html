      <h2>What will happen on Oct 29? 3I/ATLAS's could reveal its true identity, says Joe Rogan's guest</h2>

<p>On October 29, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun, according to astronomer Avi Loeb. This event presents a significant opportunity to study the object, which is only the third interstellar body detected entering our solar system.</p>

<p>The upcoming close approach of 3I/ATLAS is particularly important because it may provide clues about the object’s nature, whether it is a natural comet or a technological relic from another star system. Scientists are mobilizing resources, including the James Webb Space Telescope and ground-based observatories, to collect data during this crucial period.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 29</li>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest point to the Sun: October 29</li>
    <li>Third interstellar object detected entering the solar system</li>
    <li>Research teams: James Webb Space Telescope and ground-based observatories</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been monitored since its detection as it approaches the Sun. Avi Loeb has emphasized the importance of this close approach, noting that scientists missed a previous opportunity with ‘Oumuamua in 2017.</p>
<p>On October 29, as 3I/ATLAS interacts with solar radiation, researchers expect to observe changes in its light reflection and movement, which could indicate whether it is a natural object or something artificial.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This time, the window is open and closing fast,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the urgency of studying 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb remarked, “If there’s even a one percent chance that 3I Atlas is not natural, we owe it to ourselves to look closer.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of ‘Oumuamua, which intrigued scientists due to its unusual acceleration patterns. While many astrophysicists remain sceptical about 3I/ATLAS being anything other than a comet, Loeb advocates for a thorough investigation of outliers in scientific observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the close approach on October 29, researchers will analyze data collected to determine the object’s characteristics and potential origins. The findings could significantly impact our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
