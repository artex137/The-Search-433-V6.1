      <h2>UFO Hit By Hellfire Missile Off Yemen Coast</h2>

<p>During a House Oversight Committee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) on September 9, 2024, Representative Eric Burlison (R-MO) presented drone footage showing a flying object, described as "an orb," being struck by a projectile from an off-screen drone. The object appeared damaged but quickly resumed its original flight path. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident raises questions about UAPs and their potential implications for national security.
