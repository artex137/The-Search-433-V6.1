      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS reveals glowing coma, plasma and dust tails from ESA’s Juice mission | NavCam early images</h2>

<p>ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) has captured new observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach on 4 November 2025, at a distance of approximately 66 million kilometres. The spacecraft utilized five scientific instruments and its Navigation Camera (NavCam) to collect data about the comet's activity, structure, and composition.</p>

<p>This mission is significant as it provides insights into the characteristics and behaviour of this interstellar visitor. Juice's observations represent a crucial step in understanding distant comets. The data collected will help scientists analyze the comet's activity and its interaction with the solar wind.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed by Juice on 4 November 2025.</li>
  <li>Closest approach occurred at approximately 66 million kilometres from the comet.</li>
  <li>Juice utilized five scientific instruments for data collection.</li>
  <li>Initial data from the NavCam image shows a glowing coma and two distinct tails.</li>
  <li>Full scientific data from Juice expected on 18 and 20 February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2025, Juice shifted its focus from its primary mission of exploring Jupiter's icy moons to Comet 3I/ATLAS. During this period, the spacecraft employed its NavCam to capture early images of the comet, revealing its shape and surface features. The closest approach to the comet occurred on 4 November 2025.</p>

<p>Following this, the mission team extracted a quarter of a single NavCam image, providing an initial view of the comet's activity. This early observation indicated a glowing halo of gas, known as its coma, and two distinct tails, a plasma tail and a dust tail.</p>

<p>Full data from Juice's scientific instruments will be transmitted back to Earth on 18 and 20 February 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of both plasma and dust tails, along with the bright coma, indicates a dynamically active comet,” said a spokesperson from the Juice mission team.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These early findings promise to deepen our understanding of comets and the complex processes that shape their behaviour,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Juice was originally designed to study Jupiter's icy moons but has demonstrated versatility by providing valuable scientific insights into Comet 3I/ATLAS. This mission highlights how instruments intended for navigation can also yield significant data beyond their original purpose.</p>

<p>Comets are known to exhibit active behaviour as they approach the Sun, releasing gas and dust into space. Observations from Juice will contribute to ongoing research into cometary dynamics and their interactions within the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will analyze the full dataset from Juice's scientific instruments upon its arrival in February 2026. This data will enhance understanding of Comet 3I/ATLAS's composition and outgassing behaviour, as well as its interaction with the solar wind.</p>
