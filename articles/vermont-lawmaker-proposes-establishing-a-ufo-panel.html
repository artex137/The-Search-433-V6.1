      <h2>Vermont Lawmaker Proposes Establishing a UFO Panel</h2>

<p>Rep. Troy Headrick (I-Burlington) has introduced a bill this week to create a 10-member panel to investigate sightings of unidentified objects in Vermont's airspace. The proposed Vermont Airspace Safety and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Task Force would review reports of unexplained aerial phenomena and make recommendations to manage public safety risks. The bill aims to address concerns raised by residents about unknown objects in the sky and waterways.</p>

<p>The establishment of this panel reflects a growing interest in the investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), particularly in light of increased reports of such occurrences. The proposed task force would include representatives from various state agencies and experts in relevant fields, with the goal of providing a coordinated response to reports of unexplained sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bill introduced by Rep. Troy Headrick on behalf of lobbyist Maggie Lenz.</li>
    <li>Task force would consist of 10 members, including state officials and experts.</li>
    <li>Panel would review reports of unidentified objects and recommend safety measures.</li>
    <li>Legislation will be presented in the House Government Operations Committee on Friday.</li>
    <li>Vermont residents have reported sightings to police, highlighting the need for a formal review system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late 2024, multiple media outlets in Vermont reported sightings of unexplained lights in the night sky, including incidents in East Montpelier. Following these reports, Rep. Troy Headrick introduced the bill to establish the task force this week. The bill is set to be introduced in the House Government Operations Committee on Friday.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’m certain not saying that it’s aliens. But I do think just having the conversation here in Vermont will begin to allow for it to be taken a little bit more seriously,” said Maggie Lenz, the lobbyist who inspired the bill.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There have been lots of news stories about objects that are not necessarily extraterrestrial, but are still unknown,” said Rep. Matt Birong (D-Vergennes), chair of the House Government Operations Committee.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The proposed task force mirrors actions taken at the federal level, where the U.S. Department of Defense established an All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office to investigate UAPs. In 2023, Congress passed the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act to standardize federal investigations of sightings. The Vermont bill acknowledges the need for a coordinated approach to address public concerns regarding unidentified objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The House Government Operations Committee will review the bill on Friday to determine its next steps. The task force aims to enhance public safety by investigating reports of unidentified objects and providing recommendations based on their findings.</p>
