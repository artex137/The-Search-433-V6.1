      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: NASA tracks fastest object to enter solar system</h2>

<p>NASA has begun tracking an interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, which is entering the solar system at a speed of approximately 245,000 km/h. The comet, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) and initially named A11pl3Z, is the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The detection occurred in June 2025, and the comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun around October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it offers a unique opportunity for astronomers to study material from another star system. According to NASA, 3I/ATLAS presents clues about the chemistry and conditions of distant stellar neighbourhoods. The object has been classified as an interstellar comet due to its signs of a coma and tail. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth as it will pass at a safe distance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 245,000 km/h (152,000 mph)</li>
    <li>First detected: June 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Path: Hyperbolic, not gravitationally bound to the Sun</li>
    <li>Classification: Interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Threat level: No threat to Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA detected 3I/ATLAS in June 2025. The comet is travelling toward its perihelion, expected around October 30, 2025, when it will come just inside the orbit of Mars.</p>
<p>The object has shown tentative signs of a coma and tail, leading to its classification as an interstellar comet. Observations have revealed its high speed and unusual trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS presents a rare and exciting opportunity for astronomers to study material originating from another star system,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The evidence points to it being a natural, though unusual, comet,” the spokesperson added, addressing speculation about its origin.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed by astronomers, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The detection of such objects is significant for understanding the dynamics of our solar system and the interstellar medium.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects have sparked interest and debate regarding their origins and compositions, leading to ongoing research in astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, providing further data to astronomers to enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
