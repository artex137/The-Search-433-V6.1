      <h2>Secret 'immovable' UFO is hiding in plain sight in purpose-built structure claims US congressman</h2>

<p>A US congressman has claimed that a massive, immovable object is concealed within a specially constructed building at a secret overseas location. Rep. Eric Burlison made these statements on February 17, 2026, during an interview on Newsmax's 'Finnerty.' He stated that the facility is heavily guarded, but he did not disclose the exact location of the site.</p>

<p>This claim highlights ongoing discussions regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as UFOs. Burlison noted that he has heard about the object from various sources and expressed frustration over bureaucratic obstacles that hinder access to UAP-related sites. He has vowed to pursue transparency regarding any definitive evidence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Claim made by Rep. Eric Burlison on February 17, 2026.</li>
    <li>The object is reportedly so large it cannot be moved.</li>
    <li>The location of the building has not been disclosed.</li>
    <li>Burlison has struggled to access UAP-related sites, citing congressional bureaucracy.</li>
    <li>He is a member of the congressional oversight committee investigating UAPs.</li>
    <li>Social media speculation suggests the site may be in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 30, 2026, Burlison discussed the existence of a hidden object during a podcast. He indicated that the facility is classified, preventing him from revealing its precise location, but stated that it was part of his investigative efforts regarding UAPs.</p>
<p>During the February 17 interview, Burlison reiterated his claims, emphasizing the challenges posed by congressional bureaucracy in accessing UAP sites. He expressed a commitment to transparency if credible evidence of extraterrestrial life is discovered.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “There is reportedly an object that is not in this country that is so large it cannot be moved, that they've built an entire building around it,” said Rep. Eric Burlison.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If I come under any hard evidence, whether it's physical or video evidence that is absolutely definitive... I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe,” Burlison added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Burlison's comments come amidst a broader investigation into UAPs by Congress, which has heard testimonies from whistleblowers claiming that the government has concealed information regarding UFOs. Although the Pentagon has denied recovering physical evidence of extraterrestrial life, there is ongoing public interest in the topic, fueled by various media personalities and investigative journalists.</p>
<p>The alleged site in Yangju has gained notoriety in UFO communities and is linked to claims made by figures such as journalist Ross Coulthart and podcaster Joe Rogan. However, a South Korean UFO researcher has disputed the connection, asserting that the facility has existed since the 1970s and is unrelated to UFO phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Rep. Burlison plans to continue pursuing access to classified UAP programs and sites. He aims to overcome bureaucratic challenges in order to gather more information and provide transparency regarding any findings related to extraterrestrial life.</p>
