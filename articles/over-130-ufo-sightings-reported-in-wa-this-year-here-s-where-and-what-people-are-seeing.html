      <h2>Over 130 UFO sightings reported in WA this year</h2>

<p>Residents of Washington state have reported 133 individual sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in 2023, according to the National UFO Reporting Center. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these sightings.</p>

<p>This increase in sightings has raised interest among both the public and authorities. The National UFO Reporting Center aims to document and investigate these reports, which often include both terrestrial and atmospheric explanations for the phenomena observed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>133 UFO sightings reported in Washington state in 2023.</li>
    <li>Seattle leads with 11 reports, followed by Tacoma with 10 and Spokane with 8.</li>
    <li>Washington has recorded 6,866 sightings since 1974, making it the third-most active state.</li>
    <li>Florida has 7,749 sightings, and California has 15,401.</li>
    <li>Latest sighting reported on Oct. 8 in Tacoma and Bellingham.</li>
    <li>210,076 UFOs reported nationwide, with over 470 in the past month.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The National UFO Reporting Center has processed more than 150,000 reports since its founding in 1974. The most recent sighting in Washington occurred on Oct. 8, with reports from Tacoma and Bellingham describing a spinning disk and blinking lights, respectively. Earlier, on Sept. 9, a series of reports from around Puget Sound detailed a satellite appearing to zigzag across the sky.</p>

<p>In the past five years, Washington has ranked ninth in UFO sightings per 100,000 residents, with a total of 1,297 sightings reported.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The National UFO Reporting Center’s primary function has been to receive, record and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events,” the organization states on its website.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have long been a topic of fascination in the United States. The term "UFO" refers to any aerial phenomenon that cannot be explained, while the U.S. government has recently adopted the term "UAP" or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. Many of these sightings are later attributed to atmospheric phenomena or man-made objects, such as the Starlink satellites, which have caused confusion among observers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The National UFO Reporting Center continues to investigate recent reports and document sightings as they come in. The organization encourages individuals to report any unusual aerial phenomena they observe.</p>
