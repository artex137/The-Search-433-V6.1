      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Amid HUBBLE’s New Exocomet Image Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb Warns Of AI Misinformation</h2>

<p>NASA’s HUBBLE Space Telescope has captured a new image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The latest image shows the comet approximately 178 million miles (286 million kilometres) from Earth.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third recorded interstellar visitor to our solar system. In a blog post, Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb has also raised concerns about the increase in AI-generated misinformation regarding the comet, specifically through videos that misrepresent scientific facts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The latest HUBBLE image was taken on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 178 million miles (286 million km) from Earth at the time of imaging.</li>
    <li>The radius of the comet's glow is about 40,000 kilometres.</li>
    <li>The anti-tail extension of the comet reaches approximately 60,000 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Loeb has filed dozens of reports to YouTube regarding AI-generated misinformation but has not received a response.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered by ATLAS. NASA took an initial image of the comet on July 21, 2025, as it approached the Sun. The most recent image was captured by HUBBLE on November 30, 2025, showing the comet at a considerable distance from Earth. Following the image release, Avi Loeb publicized concerns about AI misinformation related to the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The image shows a teardrop-shaped glowing halo that extends towards the Sun,” said Avi Loeb in his blog post. “Imagine creating videos that feature avatars of scientists that look like them and speak in their voice but spread counterfactual information about 3I/ATLAS. How would the public know who to believe?”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In using AI to generate fake videos impersonating me, this YouTube channel violates several aspects of YouTube’s community guidelines and Terms of Service,” Loeb stated. “I hold the entity that created the fake videos legally liable to defamation and false content.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are living in a new reality where fake content can be easily generated by AI. This raises a serious problem of how to authenticate the validity of information on the internet,” Loeb emphasized.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of interstellar objects entering the solar system has been a subject of growing interest among astronomers. The first recorded interstellar object, 'Oumuamua, was discovered in 2017, prompting further observations of similar objects. The rise of AI-generated content poses new challenges for public understanding of scientific facts, as highlighted by Loeb's concerns regarding misinformation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb continues to advocate for the development of tools to differentiate between factual scientific content and AI-generated misinformation. He has called for stricter enforcement of community guidelines on platforms like YouTube to address the spread of false information.</p>
