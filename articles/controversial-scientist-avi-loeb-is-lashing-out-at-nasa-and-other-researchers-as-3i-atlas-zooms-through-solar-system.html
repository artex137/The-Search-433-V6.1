      <h2>Controversial Scientist Avi Loeb Is Lashing Out At NASA And Other Researchers As 3I/ATLAS Zooms Through Solar System</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University, has publicly criticized NASA and other researchers regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which was first observed over the summer. Loeb has suggested that the comet may be an alien spacecraft, a claim that has drawn backlash from the scientific community.</p>

<p>This controversy matters as it highlights the clash between scientific inquiry and speculative theories. Following a recent press conference, NASA representatives maintained that 3I/ATLAS is simply a comet, a position that Loeb strongly disputes. The debate underscores the challenges in understanding and classifying interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First Observed:</strong> Summer 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Key Figures:</strong> Avi Loeb, Jason Wright (Penn State), Steve Desch (Arizona State)</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's Position:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is a comet</li>
    <li><strong>Loeb's Claim:</strong> 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in the summer of 2023. Since then, it has attracted significant attention from both the scientific community and the public. Loeb has become a prominent figure in discussions surrounding the object, proposing that it may have alien origins, while others have criticized his assertions.</p>
<p>NASA held a press conference after the government shutdown ended, where officials reiterated that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, not addressing Loeb's theories. This has led to further tensions between Loeb and the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “NASA's representatives should have emphasized what we do not understand about 3I/ATLAS rather than insist that it is a familiar comet from a new birth environment.”

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Loeb's calculations are 100% wrong.” 
    <footer>- Steve Desch</footer>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb gained attention in 2017 for his claims regarding another interstellar object, 1I/Oumuamua, which he suggested could be a remnant of alien technology. His theories have attracted both support and criticism, leading to a polarized view of his work within the scientific community.</p>
<p>The debate over 3I/ATLAS reflects ongoing tensions between traditional scientific methods and more speculative approaches to understanding celestial phenomena. Some researchers have called for a more cautious approach to studying interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the Solar System, further observations and analyses by various researchers are expected. The scientific community may continue to address Loeb's claims, and additional data could clarify the nature of this intriguing object.</p>
