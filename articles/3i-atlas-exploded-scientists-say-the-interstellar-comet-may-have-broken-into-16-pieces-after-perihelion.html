      <h2>3I/ATLAS Exploded? Scientists Say the Interstellar Comet May Have Broken into 16 Pieces After Perihelion</h2>

<p>Recent images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS suggest that it may have exploded or fragmented into at least 16 pieces after its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, which occurred in December 2025. The discovery has intrigued astronomers as they analyze the comet's unusual behavior.</p>

<p>This potential breakup is significant as it challenges current understanding of comet behavior and raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which is only the third known interstellar visitor to our solar system. Scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics as it approaches Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS may have broken into 16 pieces.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Mass loss increased from 150 kilograms per second to nearly two million kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The comet will approach Earth at approximately 1.8 astronomical units (AU).</li>
    <li>Upcoming observations will be conducted using the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile. It was identified as an interstellar comet after astronomers found pre-discovery images from June 2025.</p>
<p>As it approached the Sun, the comet displayed unusual brightening and mass loss, peaking at perihelion in December 2025. Following this event, recent images captured by British astronomers indicated possible fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Was the dramatic mass loss and brightening of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion evidence that it disintegrated?” asked Avi Loeb. “Breakup into fragments would have increased the surface area of its material.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This would mean that 3I/ATLAS exploded at perihelion and we are witnessing the resulting fireworks,” Loeb noted in his analysis.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object identified, following ʻOumuamua and Borisov. Its behavior and characteristics challenge conventional comet theories, leading to speculation about its origins.</p>
<p>Previous observations of comets have not indicated such dramatic mass loss or fragmentation, making 3I/ATLAS a subject of intense study among astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December 2025 and Jupiter in March 2026. The results from Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes may provide definitive answers regarding the comet's status and the possibility of it having exploded.</p>
