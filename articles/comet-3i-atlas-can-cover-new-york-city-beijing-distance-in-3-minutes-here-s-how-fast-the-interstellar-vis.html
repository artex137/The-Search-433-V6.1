      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS can cover New York City-Beijing distance in 3 minutes</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-backed Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), is traveling through the solar system at 209,000 kilometers per hour, making it the fastest recorded solar system visitor. The comet's high velocity allows it to cover the distance between New York City and Beijing in just three minutes.</p>

<p>This discovery has captured the attention of scientists and astrophotographers alike, who are intrigued by the comet's changing characteristics. NASA has noted that 3I/ATLAS has likely been drifting through interstellar space for billions of years, with its speed increasing over time. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at a distance of approximately 210 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Traveling at 209,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Can travel from New York City to Beijing in three minutes.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest distance to the Sun: 1.4 astronomical units (approximately 210 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>New images taken on September 7, 2025, during a total lunar eclipse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS. Since then, scientists have conducted various observations and analyses, noting changes in the comet's shape, size, and color. On September 7, 2025, astrophotographers captured new images of the comet during a blood moon total lunar eclipse, suggesting a potential change in color to bright green as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The longer 3I/ATLAS has been out in space, the higher its speed has grown,” NASA stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If this surprising transformation turns out to be true, it would possibly be because of the comet's increasing proximity to the sun,” reported Science.com, citing experts.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its high speed and unique interstellar origin. The comet's behavior and characteristics differ from typical comets found within the solar system, prompting further scientific interest and investigation. The observations made by astrophotographers during the blood moon have provided valuable data for ongoing studies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and changing characteristics. Further observations are expected to provide insights into the comet's composition and behavior as it travels through the solar system.</p>
