      <h2>Mars Orbiter Captures Rare Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter has captured images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed Mars on October 3, 2025. This event marks the first time this comet has been photographed from Mars, as it currently cannot be easily observed from Earth due to its position on the far side of the solar system.</p>

<p>The capture of these images is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object from outside our solar system. The ExoMars orbiter, which has been studying Mars since 2016, successfully aimed its camera at the comet, demonstrating the capability of its instruments to observe distant celestial objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 20 million miles away from Mars during the observation.</li>
    <li>The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured images with five-second exposures.</li>
    <li>The orbiter typically focuses on Mars, photographing its surface from 250 miles above.</li>
    <li>Images show a bright dot of the comet among distant stars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter aimed its camera at interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it made its closest approach to Mars. The orbiter, which usually focuses on Mars, adjusted its instruments to capture the comet, which is difficult to observe from Earth due to the sun's glare.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency released a short movie of the images taken by the orbiter, highlighting the successful observation of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is an impressive achievement for a camera that is designed to observe Mars,” said Nicolas Thomas, a professor of experimental physics at the University of Bern and the principal investigator for the instrument.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as one of only three known interstellar objects detected in our solar system. Previous observations of such objects have been limited, making this successful capture a notable advancement in astronomical studies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are no immediate plans disclosed for further observations of 3I/ATLAS, but the European Space Agency continues to monitor the comet's trajectory and potential future visibility from other locations in the solar system.</p>
