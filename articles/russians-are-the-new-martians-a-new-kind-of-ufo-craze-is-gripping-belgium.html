      <h2>Russians are the new Martians: A new kind of UFO craze is gripping Belgium</h2>

<p>Belgium is experiencing a surge in public anxiety over unidentified flying objects (UFOs), with authorities linking these sightings to potential Russian espionage. The concern has prompted urgent meetings among Belgian officials, including a session of the National Security Council this week.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it underscores the rising fears of hybrid warfare amid ongoing tensions in Europe. Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken has indicated that the sightings may involve Russian drones, which could be monitoring sensitive military sites, including the Kleine Brogel Air Base, known for hosting American nuclear weapons.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Recent UFO sightings reported across Belgium.</li>
    <li>National Security Council convened this week to address public concerns.</li>
    <li>Defense Minister Theo Francken cited potential Russian drone activity.</li>
    <li>Kleine Brogel Air Base is a key military site in Belgium.</li>
    <li>Authorities have shut down airports due to security concerns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, various UFO sightings have been reported across Belgium, raising alarms among the public and officials alike. This has led to an urgent meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the implications of these sightings and the country's preparedness for such threats.</p>

<p>During the meeting, Defense Minister Theo Francken presented concerns regarding the possibility of Russian drones operating in Belgian airspace. The government has responded by shutting down airports to mitigate potential risks associated with these unidentified objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We need to reassure the public, which is becoming increasingly aware of the country's lack of preparation for this kind of threat,” said a spokesperson for the National Security Council.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These could be spy drones trying to monitor American nuclear weapons at the Kleine Brogel Air Base,” stated Defense Minister Theo Francken.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This situation echoes the Belgian UFO Wave of 1989/1990, when numerous sightings were reported, leading to public fascination and official inquiries. At that time, the Belgian Air Force attempted to investigate the phenomena, but faced challenges in providing clear answers to the public.</p>

<p>Current concerns reflect a broader trend in Europe regarding national security and the potential for hybrid warfare, particularly in light of geopolitical tensions involving Russia.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue monitoring the situation closely. Further investigations into the reported sightings and potential security threats are underway, with officials emphasizing the need for public safety and preparedness in the face of these challenges.</p>
