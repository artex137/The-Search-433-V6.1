      <h2>Shocking radar footage shows Hellfire missile fired by US military bounce off UFO over ocean</h2>

<p>The House Committee on Restoring Public Trust has unveiled a video showing a US military Hellfire missile bouncing off an unidentified flying object (UFO) over the ocean. The footage, shared by Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) during a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, captures the incident that occurred off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024.</p>

<p>This revelation has raised significant questions about the nature of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and military engagement protocols. Authorities are examining the implications of this footage and the testimonies presented during the hearing.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Weapon used: 100-pound Hellfire missile fired by an MQ-9 drone</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Two Air Force veteran whistleblowers, Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Dylan Borland</li>
    <li>Footage disclosed by: Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a Hellfire missile was fired by an MQ-9 drone targeting a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen. The missile struck the object but did not appear to have any effect, as the orb continued on its path, according to radar footage presented during a congressional hearing.</p>

<p>During the same hearing, witnesses provided accounts of past UAP encounters. Jeffrey Nuccetelli described seeing a massive rectangular craft while stationed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. He reported multiple UAP incidents, including one where a strange light hovered over the base before vanishing.</p>

<p>Dylan Borland recounted seeing a triangular UFO at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in 2012. He detailed the craft's silent ascent and lack of kinetic disturbance.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “That’s a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bounc[ing] right off, and it kept going,” said UFO expert George Knapp during the hearing. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We are cavemen throwing rocks to these things. It’s obviously not armed and/or aggressive. We are embarrassing ourselves,” tweeted Jordan Crowder, commenting on the incident.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent disclosure adds to a growing body of evidence regarding UAPs and military encounters. Previous incidents have raised concerns about national security and the need for transparent investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Military and government agencies have faced scrutiny over their handling of UAP reports, with calls for more public access to information and a clearer understanding of the phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident will continue as Congress seeks to understand the implications of UAP encounters and military responses. Further hearings and disclosures are expected as authorities assess the data and testimonies presented.</p>
