      <h2>Bombshell new video shows US military's direct hit on glowing UFO with hellfire missile</h2>

<p>A group of military whistleblowers has testified under oath at a congressional hearing that they have encountered unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and that the US intelligence community has attempted to cover up these incidents. The testimonies were presented during the third congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) on September 9, 2025, where Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri revealed a video showing a US military drone striking a UFO with a Hellfire missile on October 30, 2024. The missile reportedly bounced off the object, which continued moving at high speed off the coast of Yemen.</p>

<p>This hearing has significant implications as it sheds light on alleged government cover-ups regarding UFO sightings and encounters. The whistleblowers, who include former Air Force and Navy personnel, claim they have faced retaliation for reporting their experiences. Their testimonies raise questions about transparency and accountability in the US military and intelligence community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Incident date: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location of missile strike: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Number of whistleblowers testifying: Three</li>
    <li>Notable witness: Dylan Borland, former Air Force geospatial intelligence specialist</li>
    <li>Allegations of retaliation: Document forgery, security clearance manipulation</li>
    <li>Reported UFO types: Giant triangles, glowing cubes, Tic-Tac-shaped vehicles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a US military drone struck a UFO with a Hellfire missile, which did not disable the object. This incident was highlighted during a congressional hearing on September 9, 2025, where military whistleblowers shared their experiences with UFOs. The hearing included testimonies from veterans who described various encounters with unexplained aerial phenomena while on duty.</p>

<p>In 2012, Dylan Borland reported seeing a 100-foot triangle at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. Following his report, he alleged that multiple government agencies retaliated against him. Jeffrey Nuccetelli, another whistleblower, recounted witnessing five unexplained incidents at Vandenberg Air Force Base from 2003 to 2005. Alexandro Wiggins reported seeing Tic-Tac-shaped crafts off the Southern California coast in February 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The video shows a military drone striking an orb-shaped UFO with a missile, which bounced off and did not stop the craft,” Congressman Eric Burlison said during the hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I didn’t believe a government group was currently attempting to kill me, but my reputation has been so damaged that I’m living off of unemployment assistance,” Dylan Borland stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The critical role of whistleblowers is essential in exposing government wrongdoing,” Joe Spielberger, senior policy counsel at the Project On Government Oversight, emphasized.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This congressional hearing marks a significant moment in the ongoing discourse about UFOs and government transparency. Previous hearings have also focused on UAPs, but the testimonies from military personnel provide new insights into potential cover-ups and the experiences of those reporting these phenomena. The allegations of retaliation against whistleblowers highlight concerns about the treatment of individuals who come forward with such claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The congressional committee is expected to continue investigating these claims, including potential subpoenas for former officials involved in UAP investigations. The outcomes may lead to further disclosures regarding the US government's knowledge and handling of UFO encounters.</p>
