      <h2>Russia has been probing alien encounters, abductions for decades</h2>

<p>Legendary journalist George Knapp has released documents detailing Soviet investigations into reports of extraterrestrial craft and encounters with aliens. These documents, smuggled out of Russia 30 years ago, reveal that the USSR commissioned studies on UFOs starting from the Network-AN program in 1979. Despite an official stance in 1953 that dismissed UFOs as a fabrication by American imperialists, the investigations indicate a significant increase in UFO sightings and interactions after 1978.</p>

<p>The release of these documents has sparked renewed interest in government investigations of UFO phenomena. According to Knapp, the findings show how seriously Russia engaged with the UFO phenomenon, highlighting the need for further study into these encounters and the credibility of witnesses involved.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documents smuggled out of Russia: 30 years ago</li>
    <li>Official Soviet stance on UFOs: dismissed as a fabrication in 1953</li>
    <li>Network-AN program initiated: 1979</li>
    <li>Notable sightings include a jellyfish-shaped UFO in Nalchik on February 13, 1989</li>
    <li>Anatoly Malishev's alleged abduction: July 21, 1975</li>
    <li>Encounter with giant aliens in Derzhavinsk, Kazakhstan: June 27, 1979</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1953, the Soviet Union officially dismissed UFOs as a myth propagated by American imperialists. However, this stance changed with the initiation of the Network-AN program in 1979, which aimed to investigate reported sightings and encounters.</p>
<p>Following the program's launch, the number of reported UFO sightings and interactions surged, particularly after 1978. Notable incidents included a jellyfish-shaped UFO sighting in Nalchik on February 13, 1989, witnessed by hundreds, including military personnel and local astronomers.</p>
<p>In 1975, Anatoly Malishev claimed he was abducted and taken to an alien planet, while in 1979, children in Derzhavinsk reported encounters with 10-foot-tall aliens. These cases prompted further investigation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Releasing these documents expands the public record on how seriously Russia confronted the UFO phenomenon,” said Jeremy Corbell, an investigative journalist and Knapp's partner on the Weaponized podcast.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The new revelations come amid a growing public interest in extraterrestrial life and the government's role in investigating such phenomena. Previous incidents and reports from around the world have fueled speculation and debate about the existence of UFOs and potential alien encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the documents and the incidents they describe are expected as researchers and the public seek to understand the implications of these findings.</p>
