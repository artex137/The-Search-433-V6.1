      <h2>What Is Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS? Is It Really Going To Hit Earth? Here’s what NASA Scientists Say</h2>

<p>NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory has confirmed traces of water on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, marking a significant moment for planetary science. The observation occurred as the comet passed through our solar system, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is important because it provides insights into the chemistry of distant worlds. NASA and other monitoring agencies have stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no risk of colliding with Earth, despite public speculation regarding its potential impact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Estimated to be around 7 billion years old</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Traveling at over 58 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Water Loss:</strong> Approximately 40 kilograms of water per second</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> Perihelion in late October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Requires medium-to-large telescope to view</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by Hawaii’s ATLAS survey. Since then, NASA's Swift Observatory has detected hydroxyl gas, a byproduct of water, confirming water activity on the comet. The comet is currently on a hyperbolic path and will reach its closest point to the Sun in late October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Dr. Zexi Xing, lead researcher from Auburn University. “This is rewriting our understanding of comet behavior,” stated Professor Dennis Bodewits, co-author of the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Its unique composition and behavior differ from standard solar-system comets, with a notably high ratio of CO₂ to water.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS exits the inner solar system, astronomers will continue to track it with telescopes and potentially spacecraft instruments. Analysis of its composition and behavior will enhance our understanding of interstellar materials and comet formation.</p>
