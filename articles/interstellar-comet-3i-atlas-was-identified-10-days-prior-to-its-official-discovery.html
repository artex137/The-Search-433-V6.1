      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was identified 10 days prior to its official discovery</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was identified by the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile on June 21, 2025, ten days before its official discovery on July 1, 2025. The observatory captured images of the comet during its testing phase, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it highlights the capabilities of the Vera Rubin Observatory, which is designed to detect and photograph celestial objects. The observatory's large field of view and light-gathering ability allow it to capture images of interstellar objects that are typically difficult to observe. The astronomical community has been eagerly awaiting the observatory's full operational capabilities to find more previously unknown interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified on June 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was officially discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Vera Rubin Observatory is located in Chile.</li>
    <li>The observatory began its official operations on June 23, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nearly 100 exposures of the comet were captured until July 20, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 21, 2025, the Vera Rubin Observatory conducted test observations and captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The observatory officially commenced operations on June 23, 2025. Following its identification, the comet was formally discovered by the ATLAS system on July 1, 2025. The Vera Rubin Observatory continued to observe the comet until July 20, 2025, capturing nearly 100 exposures of its movement across the sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Thanks to its unprecedented field of view and light-gathering ability, as well as a necessary dose of luck, it photographed the comet ten days before its formal discovery,” said a representative from the Vera Rubin Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Vera Rubin Observatory is the first of its kind to have such a wide-angle survey capability, allowing it to detect millions of changes in the sky and discover a variety of interstellar objects. Prior to this, capturing interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS has been challenging for astronomers due to their brief visibility and the necessity of precise timing in telescope positioning.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Vera Rubin Observatory is expected to continue its operations, potentially identifying more interstellar objects as it gathers data from the night sky. The astronomical community is looking forward to the insights that will come from its ongoing observations.</p>
