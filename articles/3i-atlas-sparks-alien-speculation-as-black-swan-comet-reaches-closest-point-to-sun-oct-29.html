      <h2>3I/ATLAS sparks alien speculation as 'Black Swan' comet reaches closest point to Sun Oct 29</h2>

<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet has reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, causing a surge of interest and speculation about its origins. This interstellar object, described as Manhattan-sized, approaches from outside our solar system and has ignited discussions about the possibility of alien life.</p>

<p>The significance of this event has prompted international scientific communities and agencies to activate planetary defense protocols. The comet's unusual characteristics and trajectory have led to debates over whether it is a natural phenomenon or something else entirely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025, at 11:47 AM UTC</li>
  <li>Closest distance: 203 million km (126 million miles) from the Sun</li>
  <li>First spotted: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
  <li>Size estimated: Manhattan-sized interstellar body</li>
  <li>Next viewing: Early December 2025 after solar conjunction</li>
  <li>Only the third confirmed interstellar object detected</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. As it approached the Sun, scientists noted increased activity, with gas jets erupting from its icy nucleus. The comet made its closest pass to Mars on October 3, 2025. It is expected to reappear in early December 2025 after the solar conjunction.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet will make its closest approach to the Sun in late October 2025, passing just inside the orbit of Mars,” said a spokesperson for the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS challenges conventional understanding of deep space. This event has led to renewed interest in predictions made by figures like Baba Vanga, whose 2025 alien contact prediction has resurfaced on social media. Discussions about the comet's potential artificial origins have sparked significant debate among scientists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the perihelion passage concludes on October 29, 2025, researchers will continue to analyze data collected during the comet's approach. Future studies may involve potential interception missions and further observations to determine the comet’s true nature.</p>
