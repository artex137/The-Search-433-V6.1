      <h2>Watch: Stay in a UFO: Inside Pembrokeshire’s Unique Glamping Pod</h2>

<p>The owners of a unique Airbnb site in Pembrokeshire, known for its UFO-shaped glamping pod, have reported that passers-by frequently knock on their door to inquire about the peculiar structure. Martin Johnson and his wife Carol Anne operate Melin Mabes in Templeton, near Narberth, where the Spodnic UFO glamping pod has attracted global interest since its opening.</p>

<p>This unusual accommodation has drawn attention from tourists and locals alike, prompting the owners to share its story. Authorities have noted the growing popularity of quirky lodging options, which may contribute to tourism in the area.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>Since then, the pod has become a popular destination for sci-fi enthusiasts and tourists seeking unique stays. The owners have also created additional accommodations, including a tree house and a gypsy caravan.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This time of the year you get glimpses of the road and you can see it and we’ve had people knocking on our doors and asking what it is in our field,” Martin Johnson said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We were looking for something different. The glamping market is quite large and there are all sorts of different things out there,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The rise of unique lodging options, such as glamping pods, has gained traction in the UK, appealing to travelers looking for distinctive experiences. The Spodnic UFO pod is part of this trend, offering an alternative to conventional accommodations.</p>
<p>Prior to this project, the Johnsons sought to create a space where visitors could enjoy the tranquility of Pembrokeshire, moving away from standard lodging options.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Johnsons plan to continue promoting the Spodnic UFO glamping pod and their other accommodations to attract more visitors, contributing to local tourism and the unique glamping market.</p>
