      <h2>Why the Phoenix Lights Remain the Most Credible Mass UFO Sighting in U.S. History</h2>

<p>The Phoenix Lights, a mass UFO sighting that occurred on March 13, 1997, in Phoenix, Arizona, has been recognized as one of the most credible incidents of its kind in U.S. history. Thousands of witnesses reported seeing a series of lights in a V-shaped formation moving silently across the sky.</p>

<p>This incident remains significant as it has prompted ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena and their implications. Authorities have not disclosed any conclusive explanations for the lights, and investigations continue to attract interest from both the public and researchers.</p>
