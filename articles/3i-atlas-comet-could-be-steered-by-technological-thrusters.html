      <h2>3I/ATLAS comet could be steered by 'technological thrusters'</h2>

<p>A mystery object known as 3I/ATLAS, observed in our solar system, may be powered by technological thrusters, according to astrophysicist Avi Loeb. This claim follows the discovery of unusual characteristics in the comet, including jets that do not appear smeared by rotation. Loeb, a professor at Harvard University, has raised questions about the object's survival after a close solar flyby and its strange behavior.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it challenges existing understanding of comet behavior and raises the possibility that 3I/ATLAS may not be a conventional comet. Astronomers are currently investigating the object's features, including its anti-tail and powerful jets, which could indicate advanced technology at play.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Notable features: Tightly-collimated jets, anti-tail</li>
    <li>Rotation period: Every 16.16 hours</li>
    <li>Observation date: November 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance of jets: Greater than one million kilometers</li>
    <li>Location of telescope: Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Spain</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 9, 2025, astronomers captured images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing a network of jets extending over one million kilometers. Avi Loeb noted that these jets should have been smeared by the object's rotation, raising questions about their orientation. Earlier this week, a bizarre radio signal from 3I/ATLAS was detected, further fueling speculation about its nature.</p>
<p>Loeb has suggested that the jets could be powered by technological thrusters, which would allow them to maintain their direction. This theory is supported by the object's survival during a close encounter with the Sun, where it emerged intact rather than disintegrating.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Last week, preliminary images revealed a network of jets around 3I/ATLAS. These observed jets from 3I/ATLAS should have been smeared by the rotation," said Avi Loeb. "Instead, the image shows tightly-collimated jets extending to distances larger than a million kilometers."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "How could these jets maintain their orientation if 3I/ATLAS is rotating every 16.16 hours?" Loeb added, raising further questions about the object's properties.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time an object in our solar system has sparked speculation about extraterrestrial origins. Previous interstellar objects, like 'Oumuamua, have also raised questions among scientists regarding their nature and behavior. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS continue this trend, leading to discussions on the potential for advanced technology in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze its features. Further observations may provide more clarity on the object's composition and behavior, as well as the implications of its potential technological origins.</p>
