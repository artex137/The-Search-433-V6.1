      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS With A Mysterious Anti-Tail Makes Its Closest Flyby</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will pass closest to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 268.9 million kilometres. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>The flyby of 3I/ATLAS is significant for astronomers and stargazers as it presents a rare opportunity to observe an interstellar object that will not return. NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth and is purely an observational event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass within 268.9 million kilometres of Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>As of December 14, the comet was about 270.5 million kilometres away.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile during summer sky surveys.</li>
    <li>The comet's size is estimated between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Skywatchers can observe the comet in the early hours before dawn on December 19.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project will host a live stream starting at 11 PM Eastern Time on December 18.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered during summer sky surveys by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, initially flagged for its trajectory that indicated it originated outside our solar system. Observations since July have revealed a unique feature known as an “anti-tail,” which has persisted through multiple observations.</p>
<p>As of December 14, the comet was tracked at a distance of 270.5 million kilometres from Earth. NASA has emphasized the observational nature of the flyby, stating it is safe for Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This flyby is purely observational and completely safe,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Each observation helps researchers better understand how planetary systems form,” noted NASA scientist Paul Chodas.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected. Its unusual features, particularly the anti-tail, have sparked scientific interest as they challenge typical comet behavior. Previous observations of interstellar objects have provided insights into the conditions of other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its flyby, 3I/ATLAS will continue on its path deeper into the solar system, making a close pass near Jupiter in March 2024, before leaving the solar system entirely by the mid-2030s.</p>
