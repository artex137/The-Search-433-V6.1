      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Leaving the Solar System Forever — Here's How to Watch It Go</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, is now departing on a hyperbolic trajectory that ensures it will never return. First detected in July 2025, the comet has captivated astronomers with its unpredictable light changes and rare composition. Skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere have a final chance to witness its farewell in the pre-dawn sky through mid-December 2025.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks a rare opportunity to observe an interstellar visitor. NASA has confirmed the comet's status, joining 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov as notable cosmic interlopers. Its departure offers scientists a unique chance to study materials formed outside our solar neighbourhood, contributing to our understanding of planetary formation processes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) occurred on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Passed about 1.4 astronomical units (approximately 130 million miles) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Currently moving away at a speed exceeding 100,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Expected to leave the solar system permanently by January 2026.</li>
    <li>Visible in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the eastern pre-dawn sky.</li>
    <li>Will be at its brightest in mid-November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. It made its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025, during which astronomers tracked its speed and dust composition. Following this solar flyby, the comet reappeared in the night sky, becoming visible to observers in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>As it moves on a hyperbolic trajectory, astronomers have calculated its path with precision, allowing for real-time tracking until it fades from view. The comet is expected to remain visible until early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Data from the European Space Agency indicate that the comet's coma has been emitting light at wavelengths not commonly seen in known comets,” NASA reported. “This may suggest the presence of exotic ices or molecular compounds from a distant stellar nursery.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique composition and hyperbolic trajectory provide an opportunity for scientists to study materials that have not been influenced by our Sun's gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects have sparked interest in the scientific community, as they offer insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will monitor its visibility until it exits the solar system in January 2026. The ongoing observations aim to gather data on its composition and trajectory, contributing to the broader understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
