      <h2>NASA Withholding New Images of Mysterious Object From Beyond Solar System</h2>

<p>NASA has withheld high-resolution images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which came within 18 million miles of Mars last month. The images were captured by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) using its HiRISE camera, but a federal government shutdown has delayed their release.</p>

<p>The situation has prompted U.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) to urge NASA to release the images, which are believed to provide significant insights into the object’s size and characteristics. The images reportedly offer three times the resolution of previous images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS approached Mars on an unusual trajectory last month.</li>
    <li>The object is suspected to be a comet.</li>
    <li>NASA's MRO captured images with a HiRISE camera.</li>
    <li>Images were taken over a month ago but have not been released due to the government shutdown.</li>
    <li>Representative Luna sent a letter to NASA requesting the images.</li>
    <li>The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has released its own images of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October 2023, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars, prompting NASA’s MRO to capture images of the object. Shortly after the images were taken, a federal government shutdown began, hindering the release of the data.</p>

<p>On November 1, 2023, Representative Anna Paulina Luna sent a letter to interim NASA administrator Sean Duffy, urging the space agency to release the images. On November 8, Duffy confirmed that the images would be released once the government reopens, citing bureaucratic reasons for the delay.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on November 5, the China National Space Administration released images taken by its Tianwen-1 Mars Orbiter, which also captured 3I/ATLAS as it passed nearby.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,” Luna wrote in her letter to NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Just had a good conversation with NASA regarding 3I/ATLAS,” Luna tweeted. “As soon as the government reopens, they’ll be releasing images/data.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system. Its unusual characteristics have sparked interest among astronomers. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has documented its behavior, noting that the object lacks a visible tail, which is atypical for a comet that has recently passed its closest point to the Sun.</p>

<p>Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS could have an anomalously massive nucleus, which may exceed 3.1 miles in diameter and possess a mass greater than 33 billion tons.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The release of the images depends on the resolution of the federal government shutdown. Scientists and astronomers are awaiting the data to further study 3I/ATLAS and its implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>
