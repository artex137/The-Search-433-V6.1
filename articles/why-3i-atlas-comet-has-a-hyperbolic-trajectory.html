      <h2>Why 3I/ATLAS’ comet has a 'hyperbolic trajectory'?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, has been identified as an interstellar object on a hyperbolic trajectory, passing through our Solar System only once before continuing into interstellar space. Its inbound velocity has been estimated at approximately 58 km/s relative to the Sun, making it one of the fastest comets recorded.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS did not originate from within our Solar System. Observatories worldwide have tracked its movement and characteristics, leading to a better understanding of its unusual path. Astronomers view this comet as a rare opportunity to study material from beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope.</li>
    <li>Inbound velocity estimated at 58 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Orbital eccentricity calculated between 6.1 and 6.2, indicating a hyperbolic orbit.</li>
    <li>Highly inclined and retrograde orbit with a tilt of 5° relative to the ecliptic.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is classified as an interstellar object, meaning it will not return after passing through the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was officially discovered on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, astronomers located pre-discovery images from May and June of the same year, which helped refine its orbit and confirm its hyperbolic path. Observations from various telescopes have consistently supported the conclusion that 3I/ATLAS is an unbound object passing through the Solar System.</p>

<p>The comet's trajectory has been monitored using ground-based telescopes and space instruments, with imaging data confirming its characteristics and high-speed movement. This convergence of evidence has led scientists to conclude that 3I/ATLAS is indeed an interstellar comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS has an orbital eccentricity around 6.1–6.2, making it one of the most hyperbolic trajectories ever recorded for a comet-like object,” said an astronomer involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The parameters of high speed and high eccentricity indicate that it is dynamically unbound to the Sun,” the astronomer added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is distinct from long-period comets, which are typically gravitationally bound to the Sun. Unlike these Oort-cloud comets that may appear from a distance but have eccentricities less than one, 3I/ATLAS’s hyperbolic orbit suggests it originated from outside our Solar System. This makes it a valuable subject for astronomical study.</p>

<p>Prior interstellar visitors have also been observed, but 3I/ATLAS’s unique characteristics offer a rare chance to gather direct samples from interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to track 3I/ATLAS's trajectory as it exits the Solar System. Ongoing observations will focus on its coma and tail changes, as well as any further data that may enhance understanding of its interstellar origin.</p>
