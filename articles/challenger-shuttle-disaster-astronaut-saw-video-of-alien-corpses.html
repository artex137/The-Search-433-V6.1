      <h2>Challenger Shuttle Disaster Astronaut Saw 'Video of Alien Corpses'</h2>

<p>A former NASA staffer has claimed that astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka saw footage of alien corpses following a UFO crash. The assertion comes as the nation reflects on the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which occurred on January 28, 1986. The shuttle exploded 73 seconds into its flight, killing all seven crew members, including Christa McAuliffe, the first "teacher in space."</p>

<p>This revelation matters as it continues to fuel discussions about government secrecy regarding UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Authorities have not commented on the claims made by former NASA operator Clark McClelland, who recounted Onizuka’s story years after the Challenger tragedy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Space Shuttle Challenger disaster</li>
    <li>Date: January 28, 1986</li>
    <li>Location: Atlantic Ocean</li>
    <li>Fatalities: All seven crew members killed</li>
    <li>Claim made by: Clark McClelland, former NASA staffer</li>
    <li>Subject: Alleged video of alien corpses seen by Onizuka</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Seventy-three seconds into the flight, an O-ring failure caused the shuttle to explode over the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in the deaths of all crew members.</p>

<p>Years later, Clark McClelland recounted a conversation with Onizuka about a video he allegedly saw during military training. This discussion revolved around an experience Onizuka had prior to his astronaut training, where he viewed footage of what appeared to be alien corpses.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He and this group were at this base for specialized training when they were directed to report to a viewing room,” McClelland recalled. “As they were seated, the room darkened, and a movie began without the usual official introduction by a USAF officer.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The small, strange-looking creatures were humanoid in shape and appeared similar to those described by alleged witnesses at the well-known Roswell site,” McClelland explained.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Perhaps it was a planned USAF psychological test. NASA may have evaluated it in my selection as an astronaut in 1978,” McClelland quoted Onizuka as saying.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims about alien encounters are linked to the infamous 1947 Roswell incident, where the U.S. military initially stated it had recovered a UFO. The military later retracted this statement, claiming the object was a weather balloon. Since then, many have speculated about the existence of extraterrestrial life, often citing the Roswell incident as a focal point.</p>

<p>McClelland's account adds to the growing body of anecdotal evidence surrounding UFO sightings and alleged government cover-ups, particularly regarding Area 51, a highly classified U.S. Air Force facility.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No official investigations or inquiries have been announced in response to McClelland’s claims. The discussion surrounding UFOs and government transparency continues to gain traction, with many calling for further exploration into these topics.</p>
