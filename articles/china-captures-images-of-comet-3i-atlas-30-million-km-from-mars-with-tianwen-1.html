      <h2>China captures images of comet 3I/ATLAS 30 million km from Mars with Tianwen-1</h2>

<p>The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has released images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by the Tianwen-1 probe in orbit around Mars on October 3, 2025. The comet was approximately 30 million kilometers from the spacecraft at the time of capture, marking one of the closest observations of the comet to date. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it enhances the understanding of 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object in the Solar System. The mission team has coordinated the observation since September based on predictions of the comet's close pass to Mars. The data obtained will contribute to ongoing studies of the comet's behavior and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images captured on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet was 30 million kilometers from Tianwen-1.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Estimated age of the comet ranges from 3 to 11 billion years.</li>
    <li>Tianwen-1 has been in Mars orbit since February 2021.</li>
    <li>Data processing generated an animation of the comet's movement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered. Following this, the Tianwen-1 mission team began preparing for the observation of the comet, which was predicted to pass close to Mars. On October 3, 2025, Tianwen-1 successfully captured images of the comet, with the ground team processing the data to create an animation of its movement.</p>

<p>During the same period, probes from the European Space Agency (ESA), including ExoMars TGO and Mars Express, also recorded images of 3I/ATLAS from different angles, contributing to a more comprehensive analysis of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observation serves as preparation for Tianwen-2, launched in May 2025, which aims to collect asteroid samples and study the main belt comet,” said a representative from the CNSA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third known interstellar object in the Solar System, with its formation believed to have occurred around ancient stars in the Milky Way. This observation is part of a broader trend in space exploration, where multiple agencies collaborate to gather data on celestial objects, enhancing scientific understanding.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will analyze the combined data from Tianwen-1 and European probes to refine interstellar trajectory models and further study the comet's characteristics. The mission team continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it follows a hyperbolic path through the Solar System.</p>
