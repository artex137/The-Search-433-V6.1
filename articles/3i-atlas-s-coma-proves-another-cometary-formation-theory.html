      <h2>3I/ATLAS’s Coma Proves Another Cometary Formation Theory</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has continued to intrigue astronomers as it travels through our Solar System. Discovered in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, this comet is experiencing the warmth of the Sun for the first time in potentially billions of years. Researchers have closely monitored changes in its composition, which are yielding new insights into comet formation.</p>

<p>This research is significant because it helps scientists understand the processes that shape comets across different star systems. Observations of 3I/ATLAS reveal unique characteristics that differentiate it from previous interstellar visitors, such as its tail orientation and chemical composition. European researchers have published findings that align changes in nickel-to-iron (Ni/Fe) abundance ratios in the comet’s coma with theories of cometary formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It was detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the Solar System.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT).</li>
    <li>Changes in Ni/Fe ratios have been observed as the comet approaches the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is classified as a C2-depleted comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025. Since its discovery, astronomers have tracked its trajectory as it approaches the Sun, reaching distances between 3.14 AU and 2.14 AU. Observations have shown fluctuations in its Ni/Fe ratios, with nickel being detected first, followed by iron as the comet neared the Sun. These observations have been crucial for understanding its chemical composition and potential formation processes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of nickel and iron in the coma has a plausible explanation linked to organometallic compounds,” researchers stated, highlighting the significance of these findings in understanding cometary formation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of two previous interstellar objects, ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike these predecessors, 3I/ATLAS displays distinct characteristics that challenge existing models of comet formation. Its unique Ni/Fe ratios and C2-depletion suggest it originated in a different environment compared to typical comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey toward the Sun, researchers plan to conduct further observations to gather more data on its composition and behavior. This ongoing monitoring will provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of cometary formation and evolution.</p>
