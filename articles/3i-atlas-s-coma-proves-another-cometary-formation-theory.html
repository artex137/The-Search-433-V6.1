      <h2>3I/ATLAS's Coma Proves Another Cometary Formation Theory</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown significant changes as it travels through our solar system, according to a recent study by European researchers. The comet is currently nearing the Sun, with observations made between August and September 2023, as it moved from 3.14 astronomical units (AU) to 2.14 AU. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this celestial event.</p>

<p>This research is important as it helps scientists understand cometary formation and the materials present in comets. The study specifically focuses on the nickel to iron (Ni/Fe) abundance ratio in 3I/ATLAS's coma, which has implications for our understanding of both interstellar and in-system comets. Researchers have utilized the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile to monitor the comet's changes closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed from August to September 2023.</li>
<li>Moved from 3.14 AU to 2.14 AU during observations.</li>
<li>Ni/Fe ratio in the coma of 3I/ATLAS is significantly higher than previous comets.</li>
<li>First interstellar visitor to show such dramatic changes in the Ni/Fe ratio.</li>
<li>Absorption lines for nickel present throughout, while iron appeared closer to the Sun.</li>
<li>3I/ATLAS classified as a “C2-depleted” comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between August and September 2023, researchers monitored 3I/ATLAS as it approached the Sun. The observations showed that the spectral absorption line for nickel was consistently present, while the iron absorption lines only appeared once the comet was within 2.64 AU of the Sun. This indicated a significant change in the composition of the coma as the comet got closer to solar energy.</p>

<p>The researchers noted that the Ni/Fe ratio began to change dramatically during this period, a phenomenon not observed in previous studies of comets. They hypothesize that the presence of nickel and iron is linked to carbonyl groups forming volatile organometallic compounds.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The dramatic change in the Ni/Fe ratio as 3I/ATLAS approached the Sun provides new insights into cometary formation processes,” researchers stated in their paper.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study builds upon previous research on 2I/Borisov, another interstellar comet. The Ni/Fe ratio observed in 2I/Borisov was similar to those found in in-system comets but about ten times higher than that of the Sun. Such findings suggest a common process in cometary formation, regardless of the materials available in the star around which they formed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, researchers expect to gather more data on its Ni/Fe ratio and other compositional aspects. Observational studies will likely continue until the comet moves out of view for several months.</p>
