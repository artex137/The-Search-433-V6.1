      <h2>U.S. Lawmaker Says Congress Exploring UFO Talks With Russian Parliament</h2>

<p>A U.S. lawmaker has announced that Congress is seeking to organize a meeting with members of Russia’s parliament to discuss unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Representative Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, made the statement during an interview on NewsNation last week, indicating that she has “recently” spoken with Russian officials about sharing information on the topic.</p>

<p>The significance of these discussions lies in the ongoing interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and the potential for renewed dialogue between the U.S. and Russian legislatures. Luna’s comments precede a House Oversight subcommittee hearing where claims were made regarding the Soviet Union's attempts to reverse engineer UFOs during the Cold War. Her office has stated that a meeting on “neutral territory” is being prepared, although specific details have not been disclosed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna made her remarks during an interview on NewsNation.</li>
    <li>The potential meeting has not been confirmed by either the U.S. Congress or Russia's State Duma.</li>
    <li>Luna chairs the Oversight Committee’s Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.</li>
    <li>Discussions with Russian officials have occurred recently, but details on the meeting's format and date remain undisclosed.</li>
    <li>Formal U.S.-Russia parliamentary engagement has declined since 2014, following Russia's annexation of Crimea.</li>
    <li>The relationship further deteriorated after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has engaged with Russian government officials regarding UFO information. On September 17, 2025, during an interview, Luna indicated that Congress is looking to hold a bipartisan meeting with Russian parliament members. This announcement coincides with ongoing discussions about unidentified anomalous phenomena in the U.S.</p>

<p>Prior to this, the atmosphere for U.S.-Russia talks has been strained due to geopolitical tensions, particularly following significant events such as the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We’re looking forward to doing a bipartisan meeting with the Russian parliament here pretty soon,” said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna during the interview.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The prospect of U.S.-Russia parliamentary talks on UFOs comes after years of limited engagement between the two nations' legislative bodies. The last significant interactions took place prior to the geopolitical crises that have strained relations, particularly after the annexation of Crimea and subsequent actions in Ukraine.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Discussions regarding the potential meeting continue, with no specific timeline or details announced. The U.S. Congress will likely proceed with its hearing on UAPs, while further information on the proposed talks may emerge in the coming weeks.</p>
