      <h2>NASA ends comet panic with reassuring facts</h2>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have confirmed that interstellar comet 3I Atlas poses no danger to Earth, despite widespread panic fueled by social media claims. The comet was discovered by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope on July 1, 2025, and its closest approach to Earth occurred on July 21, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This reassurance is significant as misinformation about the comet has proliferated online, prompting officials to address the fears. Space experts have emphasized that the comet's trajectory keeps it safely out of reach, and they encourage the public to rely on verified sources for information.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I Atlas discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on July 21, 2025, at 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet travels at over 210,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Next closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at approximately 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Myths about the comet include claims of it being an alien spacecraft and posing an imminent threat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA discovered interstellar comet 3I Atlas using its Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on July 21, 2025, when it was 270 million kilometers away. In the following months, misinformation about the comet spread through social media, prompting NASA and ESA to issue statements confirming the comet's safe trajectory and debunking various myths. The comet will reach its nearest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I Atlas poses no risk to Earth whatsoever,” NASA stated in an official release. “It is simply passing safely through our solar system and provides scientists with a valuable research opportunity.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Atlas maintains a trajectory more than 2.5 times the distance between Earth and the Sun, making any possibility of impact completely impossible,” the ESA confirmed.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I Atlas is only the third known interstellar visitor recorded. Its unusual characteristics provide a unique opportunity for scientific research, allowing astronomers to study materials from beyond our solar system. Previous incidents of misinformation about celestial events have led to public panic, highlighting the importance of clear communication from credible sources.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor the comet's path and analyze its properties throughout October. Space experts encourage the public to seek information from verified sources to combat the ongoing spread of misinformation.</p>
