      <h2>CIA issues statement on comet 3I/ATLAS, reigniting alien theories</h2>

<p>The CIA has issued a statement regarding the comet 3I/ATLAS that has reignited speculation about its potential connection to extraterrestrial life. This statement follows the comet's closest approach to Earth in late 2022, during which no injuries or fatalities were reported.</p>

<p>This development matters as it has prompted renewed interest in conspiracy theories surrounding the comet. Authorities, including NASA, have previously confirmed the comet's natural origin, but the CIA's recent comments have led some to question the transparency of U.S. intelligence regarding the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to Earth in late 2022.</li>
    <li>The CIA issued a statement in response to a Freedom of Information Act request in November 2025.</li>
    <li>The CIA's response indicated it could "neither deny nor confirm the existence or nonexistence of records" about the comet.</li>
    <li>NASA officials confirmed the comet's natural origin in a press conference on November 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has voiced concerns about the implications of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Late 2022: Comet 3I/ATLAS passes closest to Earth with no reported issues.</p>
<p>November 2025: A Freedom of Information Act request is made to the CIA regarding 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>November 19, 2025: NASA officials confirm the comet's natural origin during a press conference.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "That this information is treated as sensitive enough to be classified by the CIA is surprising, given that NASA officials stated decisively at a press conference on November 19, 2025, that 3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CIA's use of "Glomar responses" has previously been a method to avoid disclosing sensitive information. Such responses can lead to speculation about the existence of classified materials or knowledge regarding unidentified objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor the situation and address public inquiries about 3I/ATLAS, while further investigations into the claims surrounding the comet may occur as interest persists.</p>
