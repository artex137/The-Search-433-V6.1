      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth, Visible to Select Australians in December</h2>

<p>The rare interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently passing by Earth and will become visible to select Australians starting in early December. The comet, which is not currently visible due to its proximity to the sun, is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it offers a unique opportunity for astronomers and enthusiasts to observe a rare celestial phenomenon. NASA has been actively monitoring the comet using the Hubble Space Telescope to gather data as it travels through the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of the comet on July 21, when it was 445 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to have a diameter between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>It will be closest to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 240 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of 221,000 km/s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2023, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of Comet 3I/ATLAS, marking its presence in the solar system. The comet has since continued its trajectory towards the sun, making it invisible for the time being. It is expected to become visible in early December 2023, with the best viewing opportunities around December 19.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS is a remarkable interstellar visitor, providing us with a unique opportunity to study its characteristics as it travels through our solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows a naming convention that reflects the discovery team, the NASA-funded ATLAS survey. Prior to this, only two other interstellar objects have been documented entering our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to track its trajectory and prepare for public viewing opportunities in December. Stargazers are encouraged to use star charts to locate the comet in the sky.</p>
