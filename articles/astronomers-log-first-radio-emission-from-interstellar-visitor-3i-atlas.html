      <h2>Astronomers log first radio emission from interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On 13th November 2025, astronomers in Washington reported the first detection of radio emissions from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traversing the Solar System. The signal was logged on 4th November using South Africa’s MeerKAT radio array, indicating comet-like activity.</p>

<p>This detection is significant because it suggests natural processes are at work as 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun. NASA has classified the object as a natural interstellar comet, and researchers are eager to analyze its characteristics further as it becomes more visible in December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of signal detection: 4th November 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observation: MeerKAT radio array, South Africa</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of 3I/ATLAS: up to 6 miles</li>
    <li>Surface temperature estimate: approximately 7°C</li>
    <li>Expected better viewing opportunities: early December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025. Following its identification, astronomers have closely monitored the object as it approached the Sun.</p>
<p>The radio emission signal was detected on 4th November 2025, providing new insights into the object's composition and activity. NASA has characterized the body as a natural interstellar comet, while ongoing discussions include various hypotheses about its nature.</p>
<p>In December 2025, telescopes are expected to conduct renewed observations of 3I/ATLAS as it swings around the Sun, allowing for further analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new radio detection is consistent with established cometary physics,” said a NASA spokesperson. “We anticipate that further data will refine our understanding of 3I/ATLAS as it recedes from the Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being potentially one of the oldest known interstellar objects, with estimates suggesting it may have originated in the outer reaches of the Milky Way up to seven billion years ago. The ongoing research into this interstellar visitor has sparked interest in the astrophysics community, particularly regarding its volatile composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and astronomers are preparing for renewed observations in early December 2025. They expect to gather high-resolution imagery and additional data to better understand the composition, size, and activity profile of 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the Solar System.</p>
