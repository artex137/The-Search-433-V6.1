      <h2>Scientists search for signs of aliens on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>During the closest approach of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS to Earth, scientists from the Breakthrough Listen project have searched for signs of technosignatures, or evidence of potential alien messages. The closest distance occurred on December 19, when 3I/ATLAS was approximately 270 million kilometres from Earth.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it explores the possibility of extraterrestrial life and enhances understanding of interstellar objects. Authorities from the Breakthrough Listen project, along with other scientists, have published two studies on the arXiv preprint server, detailing their findings regarding 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was 270 million kilometres away at its closest point.</li>
    <li>Size of the comet's nucleus estimated between 820 and 1,050 metres.</li>
    <li>Two studies published on the arXiv preprint server.</li>
    <li>No evidence of alien signals detected to date.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third such object identified in the Solar System. On December 19, 2025, the comet reached its closest distance to Earth, prompting scientists to investigate the possibility of alien technosignatures.</p>

<p>Following this close approach, scientists conducted studies to analyze the comet’s characteristics and size, leading to the publication of findings on the arXiv preprint server.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The study showed that 3I/ATLAS mainly exhibits characteristics typical of comets. So far, there is no evidence that it is an alien spacecraft sending signals,” scientists stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Nevertheless, astronomers discovered nine strange 'events' that require more thorough investigation using radio telescopes to confirm or refute that these radio signals are related to natural phenomena on the comet,” the report indicated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The search for extraterrestrial signals has gained momentum with the discovery of various interstellar objects. Previous studies have explored similar hypotheses, but 3I/ATLAS represents a unique opportunity due to its proximity and characteristics.</p>

<p>While the possibility of alien spacecraft has been largely ruled out for 3I/ATLAS, the ongoing research underscores the need for continued observations and analysis of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS to completely rule out the possibility of it being an artificial object. Investigations into the nine peculiar events detected will also continue, utilizing radio telescopes to gather more data.</p>
