      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Sparks Debate in Astronomical Community</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has generated significant discussion among astronomers after a new image showed its unusual characteristics. Captured on November 22, 2025, by astrophotographer Mitsunori Tsumura, the photograph depicts the comet as it passed near the galaxy NGC4454 in the constellation Virgo. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this celestial event.</p>

<p>The image has raised questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which is the third confirmed interstellar visitor after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Authorities and researchers are now investigating the physics behind the object's behaviour and its implications for our understanding of comets and potential artificial structures in space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of image capture:</strong> November 22, 2025, at 19:25 UTC</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 300 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Main tail length:</strong> About 5 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Anti-tail length:</strong> Approximately 1 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Measured speed:</strong> 400 metres per second</li>
    <li><strong>Mass loss:</strong> Estimated at 200 tons per second for the anti-tail alone</li>
    <li><strong>Next close approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual characteristics since its discovery. Initially, it displayed no non-gravitational acceleration during the summer months of 2025, moving like a rock. However, significant changes occurred around perihelion on October 29, 2025, when the object made its closest approach to the Sun. At this point, measurable non-gravitational acceleration was detected, raising new questions about its composition and behaviour.</p>

<p>Following the image capture in late November, researchers are now preparing for further observations, including spectroscopic measurements planned for December 2025. These observations aim to clarify the object's propulsion mechanisms and overall nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anti-tail's ability to penetrate through the solar wind at that distance demands physics that stretch the boundaries of what we expect from natural comets,” said Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS follows previous discussions about interstellar objects, particularly 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Both of these objects have prompted scientists to reconsider the definitions and characteristics of comets. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds another layer of complexity to this ongoing investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will conduct spectroscopic measurements in December 2025 to determine the jets' speed and composition. Additionally, tracking will assess whether 3I/ATLAS will approach Jupiter's Hill radius on March 16, 2026, which could further influence its trajectory and provide more insight into its nature.</p>
