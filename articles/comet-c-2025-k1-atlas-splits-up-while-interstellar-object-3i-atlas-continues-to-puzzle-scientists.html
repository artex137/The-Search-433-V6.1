      <h2>Comet C/2025 K1 (Atlas) Splits Up While Interstellar Object 3I/Atlas Continues to Puzzle Scientists</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported that Comet C/2025 K1 (Atlas) has split into three core pieces while the interstellar object 3I/Atlas remains intact and continues to intrigue researchers. The comet was observed to fragment on November 11-12, 2025, at the Asiago Observatory in Italy, following its closest approach to the Sun on October 8. There are no injuries or fatalities reported from this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it highlights the dynamic nature of celestial bodies in our Solar System. The fragmentation of C/2025 K1 (Atlas) offers insights into the structural integrity of comets, while the unusual behaviour of 3I/Atlas raises questions about its origin. Scientists around the world are monitoring both objects closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (Atlas) was discovered in May 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet split into three core pieces observed on November 11-12, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is moving at a speed of 140,000 mph (225,000 km/h) relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>The interstellar object will reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images show jets extending approximately 1 million kilometers towards the Sun and 3 million kilometers in the opposite direction from 3I/Atlas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>May 2025: Comet C/2025 K1 (Atlas) is discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</p>
<p>October 8, 2025: The comet makes its closest approach to the Sun, compromising its structural integrity.</p>
<p>November 11-12, 2025: Astronomers at the Asiago Observatory observe the comet fragmenting into three pieces.</p>
<p>July 1, 2025: 3I/Atlas is discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: 3I/Atlas is expected to reach its closest point to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project, stated, “Given the large-scale jets reported recently, the fact that 3I/ATLAS remains a single body is surprising for a natural comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also mentioned, “Technological thrusters which point their exhaust towards the Sun would accelerate away from the Sun. This post-perihelion maneuver might be employed by a spacecraft that aims to gain speed rather than slow down through the gravitational assist from the Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed in our Solar System, following 1I ‘Oumuamua and 2I Borisov. These objects challenge existing theories about the formation and behaviour of comets. The fragmentation of C/2025 K1 (Atlas) provides an opportunity for scientists to study the internal structure of comets and their responses to solar proximity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are awaiting new imagery and data from 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth. The upcoming closest approach on December 19, 2025, will be crucial for understanding the object's nature and behaviour.</p>
