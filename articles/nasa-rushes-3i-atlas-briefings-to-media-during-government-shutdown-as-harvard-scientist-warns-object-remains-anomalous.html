      <h2>NASA Rushes 3I/ATLAS Briefings to Media During Government Shutdown as Harvard Scientist Warns Object Remains Anomalous</h2>

<p>NASA has conducted media briefings regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS during the ongoing government shutdown, which began on October 1. The briefings occurred shortly before the object’s closest approach to Mars on October 3, raising concerns among scientists about the accuracy of the information shared.</p>

<p>The shutdown has furloughed over 15,000 NASA employees, impacting the agency's ability to process and analyze data. Preliminary information released on October 4 characterized 3I/ATLAS as an ordinary comet. However, Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has warned that the object exhibits anomalous properties that require further observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA furloughed over 15,000 employees on October 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to have a mass exceeding 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS lost approximately 150 kilograms of mass every second during its approach.</li>
    <li>The object passed within 29 million kilometers of Mars.</li>
    <li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, equipped with the HiRISE camera, is stationed at Mars.</li>
    <li>Dr. Loeb's team compiled around 4,000 observations from 227 observatories worldwide.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS's trajectory aligns within 9 degrees of the direction of the 1977 "Wow! signal."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 1, NASA began a government shutdown, resulting in the furlough of over 15,000 employees. Just two days later, on October 3, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest approach to Mars.</p>
<p>The following day, on October 4, NASA shared preliminary information about 3I/ATLAS with select media outlets without supporting technical reports or images. The agency characterized the object as an ordinary comet despite concerns raised by Dr. Loeb.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Losing mass in a preferred direction is supposed to push the object in the opposite direction,” Dr. Loeb explained. “So, there was a force acting on it as a result of its evaporation, and that did not introduce itself into the trajectory.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It would be really anomalous the bigger it is,” Dr. Loeb stated regarding the mass of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The October 3 Mars flyby presented a significant opportunity for NASA's telescopes to capture detailed images of 3I/ATLAS. However, the shutdown has hindered the agency's ability to provide timely analysis. Dr. Loeb's research indicates that 3I/ATLAS possesses properties that conventional comet models cannot explain, highlighting the need for further investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has not disclosed when complete data and images from the Mars flyby will be made public. Dr. Loeb's team expects to determine the object's true size by the end of the week using data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>
