      <h2>‘If 3I/Atlas Is a Massive Mothership’: Harvard Prof on Possible Oct. 29 Alien Spaceship Reveal</h2>

<p>In June 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/Atlas, an object the size of Manhattan, hurtling toward our solar system at a speed of 140,000 mph. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that this interstellar object might be an alien spaceship, with significant developments expected on October 29, when it reaches its closest point to the sun.</p>

<p>This revelation has garnered attention as scientists and astronomers analyze the object’s characteristics and trajectory. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring 3I/Atlas but have not indicated any immediate concerns regarding its nature or trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object observed by astronomers.</li>
    <li>It was first spotted in June 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is travelling at 140,000 mph.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will not come closer than 170 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>Nasa’s Thomas Statler has stated that the object behaves like a comet.</li>
    <li>Loeb leads the Galileo Project, which searches for extraterrestrial technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>June 2025: Astronomers discover 3I/Atlas, an object from interstellar space.</p>
<p>October 29, 2025: The object is expected to reach its perihelion, the closest point to the sun.</p>
<p>During its approach, Professor Loeb has raised questions about the object’s nature and the possibility of it being an artificial structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Thomas Statler, head of NASA’s Solar System Small Bodies program.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Jumping to a conclusion—such as calling 3I/Atlas an alien spaceship—‘as a substitute for the simple statement, ‘I don’t know what it is,’ is counterproductive to the scientific process,” said Neil deGrasse Tyson, a science educator.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is among the few interstellar objects observed, raising questions about their origins and nature. The scientific community generally views 3I/Atlas as a unique comet, despite Professor Loeb's theories suggesting otherwise. The ongoing discussions reflect a broader interest in the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas approaches its perihelion, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and characteristics. Further analysis may occur after October 29, depending on observations made during its closest approach to the sun.</p>
