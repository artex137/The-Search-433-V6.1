      <h2>Skeptical of UAPs and aliens? This new documentary is trying to change your mind</h2>

<p>Filmmaker Dan Farah has screened his new documentary, “The Age of Disclosure,” at New York City’s Intrepid Museum aboard the decommissioned USS Intrepid aircraft carrier. The documentary, which premiered at the SXSW Film Festival in March, explores claims about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and alleged global competition over alien technology. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the screening.</p>

<p>This documentary aims to challenge skepticism about UAPs and extraterrestrial life. It features interviews with over 30 insiders from the U.S. government, military, and intelligence communities. Officials have emphasized the importance of transparency regarding UAP investigations, with bipartisan support for declassifying related intelligence.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>“The Age of Disclosure” premiered at the SXSW Film Festival in March 2023. The documentary was screened at the Intrepid Museum on Tuesday, where filmmaker Dan Farah and several subjects, including Jay Stratton, discussed its content and significance. The film combines military video evidence and firsthand accounts from intelligence community members.</p>

<p>In the documentary, U.S. Rep. André Carson shares insights about UAPs, emphasizing their unusual capabilities. The film also claims an ongoing technological arms race among the U.S., Russia, and China, driven by the discovery of crashed UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is one of the most important documentaries ever made,” said Jay Stratton, former director of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, at the screening.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It takes a lot of guts for people to come forward on the record about their experiences,” said retired Navy Cmdr. David Fravor, whose UAP encounter was featured in the film.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The government has something, and they need to turn it over to us,” stated Rep. Tim Burchett during a House Oversight Committee hearing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary comes amid growing public interest and governmental scrutiny regarding UAPs. Recent calls for transparency include the UAP Transparency Act, introduced by Rep. Burchett, which would require federal agencies to declassify information related to UAPs. These discussions reflect a shift in how UAPs are perceived, moving from skepticism to a more open inquiry.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio noted a bipartisan effort to push for the declassification of UAP-related intelligence, emphasizing that it is not a politically divisive issue.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the screening, there are plans for further discussions aimed at increasing public awareness and governmental transparency regarding UAPs. The documentary has been named among the 201 eligible for Oscar consideration by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>
