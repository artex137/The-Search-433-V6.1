      <h2>Skeptical of UAPs and aliens? This new documentary is trying to change your mind</h2>

<p>Filmmaker Dan Farah has screened his new documentary, “The Age of Disclosure,” at New York City’s Intrepid Museum aboard the USS Intrepid aircraft carrier. The event took place on Tuesday and featured interviews with over 30 U.S. government, military, and intelligence community insiders discussing unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and alleged alien technology.</p>

<p>The documentary claims to reveal a cover-up spanning 80 years regarding non-human intelligent life and a global arms race to reverse-engineer advanced technology. Authorities, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have expressed support for declassifying information related to UAPs, emphasizing the bipartisan nature of the issue.</p>

<p>In September 2023, U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett introduced the UAP Transparency Act, aimed at mandating the declassification of all federal agency records related to UAPs.

<p>Retired Navy Cmdr. David Fravor, who is featured in the film, emphasizes the courage required for individuals to come forward about their encounters with UAPs, reflecting the serious tone the documentary aims to convey.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
