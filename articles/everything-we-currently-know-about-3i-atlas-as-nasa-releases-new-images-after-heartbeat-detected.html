      <h2>Everything we currently know about 3I/ATLAS as NASA releases new images after 'heartbeat' detected</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has been observed to exhibit a 'heartbeat' effect as it travels through our solar system. The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023, coming within approximately 170 million miles of the planet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the third interstellar object detected, providing researchers with an opportunity to study its unusual characteristics. The European Space Agency has noted visible features such as the comet's glowing halo, or coma, and hints of two tails. Scientists are actively analyzing the data to understand more about the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2023, from Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, at approximately 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>Diameter of the nucleus estimated between 440 metres and 5,600 metres.</li>
    <li>Initial speed was about 137,000 miles per hour, accelerating to approximately 153,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars occurred in early October, at about 19 million miles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2023, when it was approximately 420 million miles from Earth. Observations continued, revealing a periodic brightening of the comet. As it approached the sun, its speed increased due to gravitational pull. The object is expected to pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<p>Throughout its journey, scientists have noted its peculiar characteristics, including its unusual color and composition, which may indicate an origin of up to 11 billion years ago. The comet's behavior has sparked debate among scientists, with varying theories about its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Not only do we clearly see the glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet known as its coma, but we also see a hint of two tails,” said the European Space Agency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There are many anomalies of this object, so you can't say conclusively that it's one thing or another. What we should be is curious, you know, wonder about what it is, and just collect more data,” stated Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff. It is entirely natural in origin,” remarked Professor Brian Cox, emphasizing the need to appreciate the comet as a natural phenomenon.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following previous discoveries that have intrigued scientists. The unique features of this comet, including its composition and behavior, have led to speculation regarding its origins and potential significance in understanding interstellar objects. This comet's detection highlights advances in technology, such as the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), which aids in identifying potential threats from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, scientists will continue to monitor and analyze data to better understand its characteristics. Further observations and studies are planned to assess its composition and behavior, contributing to the ongoing research into interstellar objects.</p>
