      <h2>SOHO spots water gushing from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after its Sun pass</h2>

<p>Scientists have tracked water output from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using ultraviolet observations from the Solar and Heliosphere Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft after the comet's late-October pass around the Sun. The comet's water production peaked in early November and has since sharply declined as it moves away from the Sun. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This observation is significant because it provides rare "after-perihelion" data on one of only three confirmed interstellar visitors to the solar system. Researchers aim to understand the comet's behavior as it fades, which presents a narrow window for documentation. The measurements are crucial for comparing the comet's characteristics with those of ordinary solar-system comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of peak water production: November 6, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at peak: 1.4 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Water release rate at peak: 3.17 x 10<sup>29</sup> molecules per second</li>
    <li>Water output by early December: between 10 and 20 trillion molecules per second</li>
    <li>Estimated size of the comet's nucleus: between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Percentage of active surface: approximately 20%</li>
    <li>Visibility from Earth expected to continue into spring 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS passed around the Sun, leading to increased activity due to solar heating. On November 6, scientists observed the peak water production from the comet. Over the following weeks, the water output gradually declined, consistent with patterns seen in other solar-system comets as they move away from the Sun.</p>
<p>The findings were reported in a preprint study, which relies on a SOHO instrument called SWAN that detects ultraviolet light from hydrogen. This allowed researchers to back-calculate the comet’s water production based on the observed hydrogen "glow."</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The 3I/ATLAS results add a rare post-perihelion checkpoint for comparing an interstellar comet’s behavior with the icy bodies formed closer to home,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS are rare, with only two others confirmed: 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These objects are valuable for studying the formation of other planetary systems. However, they typically do not linger in the solar system, making observations challenging.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and remains observable with small telescopes. Researchers continue to analyze the data to refine their understanding of interstellar comets and their characteristics as they move through the solar system.</p>
