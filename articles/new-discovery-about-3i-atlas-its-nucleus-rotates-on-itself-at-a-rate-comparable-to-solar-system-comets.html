      <h2>New discovery about 3I/ATLAS: its nucleus rotates on itself at a rate comparable to Solar System comets</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, has shown new insights into its behavior following its close approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Observations have revealed a rotating jet of gas and dust emerging from the comet's nucleus, which changes direction periodically.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for scientists studying interstellar objects. The findings, made possible by nearly forty nights of observations with the Two-meter Twin Telescope at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, mark the first detailed measurement of an interstellar comet's rotation period based on its own activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Earlier observations were noted from mid-June at various telescopes, including the Palomar Observatory in the United States.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus completes a rotation every 14-17 hours.</li>
    <li>The observation campaign lasted from July to September 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third identified object of interstellar origin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was officially detected by the ATLAS system. Subsequent reviews found earlier observations from mid-June at several telescopes. From July to September 2025, astronomers conducted an observation campaign using the Two-meter Twin Telescope at the Teide Observatory to study the comet's behavior.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet made a close approach to Earth, prompting further analysis of its rotational characteristics and gas and dust emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This movement has been key to calculating the comet's rotation period,” said a spokesperson for the research team. “The data analyzed confirms that the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS rotates at a rate comparable to many comets in our Solar System.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third identified object of interstellar origin, with a hyperbolic trajectory indicating it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. Previous studies of other interstellar objects have provided insights into their origins and behaviors, but none have offered such detailed measurements of rotation until now.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue studying 3I/ATLAS to further understand its material expulsion and how it responds to solar heat, potentially leading to future discoveries about comets from different planetary systems.</p>
