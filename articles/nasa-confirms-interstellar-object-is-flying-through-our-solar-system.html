      <h2>NASA confirms interstellar object is flying through our solar system</h2>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed that an interstellar object, a comet named 3I/ATLAS, is currently passing through our solar system. The comet, which originates from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, is approximately 420 million miles away and is only the third such object ever observed.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances our understanding of interstellar objects and their trajectories. Currently, the comet is visible to ground telescopes and will remain so until September, after which it will pass too close to the sun for observation. NASA has assured the public that the comet poses no threat to Earth, maintaining a minimum distance of 150 million miles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is located about 420 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on July 1 by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey telescope in Rio Hurtado.</li>
    <li>It is expected to be visible through September 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will reappear in December 2025 after passing behind the sun.</li>
    <li>The last similar interstellar object was comet 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The first interstellar object observed was asteroid ‘Oumuamua.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey telescope in Rio Hurtado. It has been confirmed by NASA as an interstellar object passing through our solar system.</p>

<p>Currently, the comet is visible to ground telescopes and will remain so until September 2025. After this period, it will come too close to the sun for observation. NASA expects the comet to reappear in December 2025 on the other side of the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa said that the comet poses no threat to Earth and will maintain a minimum distance of 150 million miles from Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of interstellar objects is a rare event. Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the last interstellar comet observed was 2I/Borisov in 2019. The first interstellar object, asteroid ‘Oumuamua, was seen in 2017, marking a significant milestone in the study of objects from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to investigate the size and physical properties of comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Further observations will be conducted when the comet reappears in December 2025.</p>
