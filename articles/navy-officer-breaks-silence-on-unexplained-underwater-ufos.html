      <h2>Navy Officer Breaks Silence on Unexplained Underwater UFOs</h2>

<p>Former U.S. Navy officers have raised concerns about unidentified submerged objects (USOs) during a recent investigation highlighted by Popular Mechanics. These encounters have occurred in oceans worldwide, with significant reports dating back to 2014. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to these sightings.</p>

<p>The implications of these sightings have prompted military officials to categorize these phenomena as a legitimate threat. Authorities are now advocating for increased transparency and investigations into the nature of these phenomena. Retired Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet and Lieutenant Ryan Graves have briefed officials in Washington about the national security implications surrounding USOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First reported encounter: 2014, near Virginia Beach.</li>
    <li>Key witness: Lieutenant Ryan Graves, F/A-18 pilot.</li>
    <li>Notable object: Cube within a clear sphere observed within 15 meters of Graves' jet.</li>
    <li>Legislation: UAP Disclosure Act passed in 2023.</li>
    <li>Recent sightings: USS Jackson in 2023, USS Omaha in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2014, Lieutenant Ryan Graves experienced anomalous radar signals during training exercises that were initially dismissed as glitches. However, these signals re-emerged, confirmed by infrared and optical evidence. Over the years, Graves and other pilots from the USS Nimitz and USS Princeton reported similar sightings, leading to the military's adoption of the term "unidentified anomalous phenomena" (UAPs).</p>

<p>In 2015, retired Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet analyzed footage of transmedium crafts recorded by jets from the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Notably, a Tic Tac-shaped object was reported by pilots from the USS Nimitz in 2004, which descended from 80,000 feet to sea level in under a second. In 2013, a spherical object was captured entering the ocean without a splash, later resurfacing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What I saw was not our technology,” said Gallaudet, emphasizing that no nation possesses craft with such capabilities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We’re at a unique moment in history,” Graves stated, referring to the availability of new tools for data revelation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior incidents involving USOs have raised questions about national security and the potential for nonhuman intelligence. The UAP Disclosure Act in 2023 mandates that federal agencies catalog and disclose information regarding nonhuman crafts, indicating a shift in government policy towards transparency on these matters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into USOs are ongoing, with officials considering the implications for national security. Both Graves and Gallaudet continue to advocate for more comprehensive studies and transparency regarding these unexplained phenomena.</p>
