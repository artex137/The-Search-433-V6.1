      <h2>Alien attack in November? Harvard scientists warn mysterious object hurtling towards Earth</h2>

<p>Scientists have identified a mysterious space object, known as 3I/ATLAS, that may be an alien spacecraft and is currently moving towards Earth, with a potential close approach in late November 2025. The object, approximately the size of Manhattan, has raised concerns about the possibility of a surprise attack.</p>

<p>This discovery has prompted researchers, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, to warn of the potential dangers posed by the object. Authorities are currently assessing the implications of this finding and considering possible defensive measures, although the study has not yet undergone peer review.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (previously A11pl3Z)</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> 10 to 20 kilometres wide</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 60 kilometres per second</li>
    <li><strong>First spotted:</strong> By the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> Late November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Lead researcher:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Scientists first detected 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The object is currently travelling towards the Sun, with its closest approach to Earth expected in late November 2025. Researchers have begun to analyze its trajectory and potential implications.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity, and would possibly require defensive measures to be undertaken (though these might prove futile),” the authors stated in their report.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This paper is contingent on a remarkable but, as we shall show, testable hypothesis, to which the authors do not necessarily ascribe, yet is certainly worthy of an analysis and a report,” the researchers noted.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study on 3I/ATLAS builds on previous research around unidentified aerial phenomena, particularly the interstellar object ʻOumuamua, which Avi Loeb has suggested could be an artificial probe from an alien civilization. This ongoing interest in extraterrestrial life continues to stir debate within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research team plans to conduct further analysis of the object’s trajectory and characteristics as they await peer review of their study. Authorities may also consider potential defensive strategies in response to the findings. Further updates are expected as the situation develops.</p>
