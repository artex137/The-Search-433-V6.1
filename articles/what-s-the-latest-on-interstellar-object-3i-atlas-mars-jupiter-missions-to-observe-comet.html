      <h2>What's the latest on interstellar object 3I/ATLAS? Mars, Jupiter missions to observe comet</h2>

<p>A comet known as 3I/ATLAS, confirmed to have originated outside Earth's solar system, is currently on the opposite side of the sun from Earth, making it impossible to observe from the ground. The object, about 3.5 miles wide, has prompted interest from astronomers and space agencies due to its rarity, as it is one of only three known interstellar objects to visit our solar system.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has generated excitement and urgency among scientists. They are now focused on observing the comet using orbiters around Mars and Jupiter, as these missions will provide valuable data before the comet continues its journey out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at about 220,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>It was first spotted in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Mars will occur on October 3, 2025, at a distance of about 30,000 kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope observed the comet in July, estimating its size between 300 meters and 3.5 kilometers wide.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass within 209 million kilometers of Earth on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations from Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will occur until October 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will observe the comet from November 2-25, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers confirmed the interstellar origins of 3I/ATLAS. Observations revealed its high speed and trajectory, indicating a hyperbolic orbit that will carry it back into interstellar space. The object was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, which is part of the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.</p>

<p>Following its discovery, the Hubble Space Telescope conducted observations in July, leading to estimates of the comet's size. The James Webb Space Telescope observed 3I/ATLAS on August 6, and the SPHEREx telescope continued observations from August 7-15. Recently, the Gemini South telescope in Chile observed the comet's growing tail.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches the sun, it will be observed by orbiters around Mars and Jupiter, providing crucial data on its characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The urgency to study 3I/ATLAS is high, as we may not have another opportunity to observe such a rare interstellar visitor,” said a representative from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three confirmed interstellar objects to enter our solar system, following the detection of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and comet Borisov in 2019. The rarity of such events has sparked public interest and speculation, including theories about the object's origins and nature.</p>

<p>While some researchers, such as Avi Loeb from Harvard University, have proposed alternative theories regarding the comet's nature, the scientific consensus currently identifies it as a comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to gather observations of 3I/ATLAS from Mars and Jupiter orbiters until the comet's closest approaches. After passing the sun, the comet will reappear in December 2025, becoming visible from Earth once again.</p>
