      <h2>Nasa's fleet of telescopes, spacecraft glimpse 3I/ATLAS. See photos of interstellar comet</h2>

<p>Nasa has captured multiple images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from various spacecraft, including its Psyche mission, over the course of several months in 2025. The observations were made while the comet was approximately 33 million miles from the Psyche spacecraft, with key imaging occurring between July and October of that year.</p>

<p>This research is significant for astronomers as it helps refine the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and enhances understanding of its faint coma, or cloud of gas, surrounding its nucleus. The comet, which originated from interstellar space, is the third such object ever detected by astronomers as it traverses our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was observed by NASA's Psyche mission on September 8 and 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was located approximately 33 million miles from the Psyche spacecraft during observations.</li>
    <li>Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of the comet on July 21, 2025, from 277 million miles away.</li>
    <li>The comet was traveling at a speed of 130,000 miles (209,000 kilometers) per hour.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected by astronomers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The observations of comet 3I/ATLAS occurred over several months:</p>
<ul>
    <li>July 1, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>July 21, 2025: Hubble captures an image of the comet from 277 million miles away.</li>
    <li>August 6, 2025: The James Webb Space Telescope observes 3I/ATLAS with its Near-Infrared Spectrograph.</li>
    <li>August 7-15, 2025: NASA’s SPHEREx space telescope observes the comet.</li>
    <li>September 8-9, 2025: The Psyche mission acquires four observations of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>October 2, 2025: The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera captures the comet from 19 million miles away.</li>
    <li>October 9, 2025: An image of the comet’s coma is taken by an instrument onboard NASA's MAVEN spacecraft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "These observations help us learn more about the faint coma surrounding the comet's nucleus," a NASA spokesperson said.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as one of only three interstellar objects detected by astronomers. Its discovery and subsequent observations have provided valuable data for understanding the composition and behavior of comets originating from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, with further observations planned to enhance scientific knowledge about its properties and trajectory.</p>
