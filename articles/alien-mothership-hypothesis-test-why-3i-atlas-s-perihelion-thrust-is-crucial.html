      <h2>'Alien Mothership' Hypothesis Test: Why 3I/ATLAS's Perihelion Thrust Is Crucial</h2>

<p>Astronomers have prepared for a decisive test as interstellar object 3I/ATLAS reaches its perihelion on 29 October 2025, when it will pass behind the Sun. The comet, formally designated C/2025 P1 (ATLAS), is travelling at extraordinary speed on a hyperbolic orbit, suggesting it originated beyond our Solar System. While most scientists classify it as a natural comet, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has proposed that 3I/ATLAS might be an alien 'mothership' capable of controlled propulsion.</p>

<p>This hypothesis is significant because it hinges on the perihelion event, the moment when a deliberate thrust could potentially be detected. Loeb's team outlined their hypothesis in a paper posted on arXiv, detailing how 3I/ATLAS could perform a reverse Solar Oberth manoeuvre, a type of high-energy thrust near the Sun. If the object accelerates or decelerates at perihelion, it could change its trajectory in a way impossible for a passive comet, according to Loeb.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 P1)</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: 29 October 2025</li>
    <li>Current status: In solar conjunction, invisible from Earth until late November</li>
    <li>Expected close approach to Jupiter: March 2026, at about 0.36 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Loeb's hypothesis posted on: arXiv</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Loeb and his co-authors proposed the possibility of 3I/ATLAS performing a reverse Solar Oberth manoeuvre. The perihelion event is scheduled for 29 October 2025, when the comet will be hidden from Earth's view. Following this event, astronomers will track the object's trajectory to see if it deviates from predictions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "If 3I/ATLAS changes its trajectory in an unexpected way after perihelion, that will be a moment of reckoning."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Astrophysicist Chris Lintott of the University of Oxford warned, "Loeb's arguments rely on weak data and speculative interpretations," stressing that such claims could distract from valuable comet research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Most astronomers reject the mothership theory, noting that the data fits natural comet behaviour. A Snopes fact-check has debunked claims that 3I/ATLAS is "very likely" alien. Even Loeb himself concedes that the most probable explanation remains a volatile-rich interstellar body, not technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories plan to resume tracking 3I/ATLAS in November 2025 when it re-emerges from solar conjunction. Astronomers will compare its post-perihelion speed and angle with gravitational models. If its trajectory shifts even slightly, Loeb's hypothesis gains weight; if not, the 'alien mothership' idea may fade from scientific discourse.</p>
