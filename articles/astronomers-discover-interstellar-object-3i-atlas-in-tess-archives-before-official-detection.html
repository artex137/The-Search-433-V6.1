      <h2>Astronomers Discover Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS in TESS Archives Before Official Detection</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS in data collected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), with prior observations dating back to May 7, 2025. Researchers from Michigan State University and Auburn University identified the object, which was initially detected in July 2025, indicating it may have exhibited activity before its formal designation.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it highlights the potential of archival data from telescopes to reveal previously unnoticed celestial phenomena. The TESS satellite, primarily designed for studying stars and detecting exoplanets, has now provided insights into the characteristics of an interstellar visitor, contributing to the understanding of such objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First Detection:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Earliest Recorded Observation:</strong> May 7, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> Decreased from 6.35 AU to 5.47 AU by June 2, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness Increase:</strong> Observed increase by a factor of five</li>
    <li><strong>Research Institutions:</strong> Michigan State University and Auburn University</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 7, 2025, TESS recorded the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS during its observation periods. The object was later identified by researchers in July 2025. By June 2, the distance of 3I/ATLAS from the Sun had decreased significantly, contributing to its increased brightness.</p>

<p>To detect the object, the research team employed a technique called "shift-stacking," allowing them to enhance the signal from 3I/ATLAS in TESS images. This method involved predicting the object's location, adjusting the images, and combining multiple frames.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of a coma likely obscured any noticeable features, making it difficult for TESS to detect changes in brightness indicative of rotation,” said researcher Adina Feinstein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Comets from other solar systems could possess distinctly different materials compared to those bound to our own solar system,” noted Darryl Seligman.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery contributes to ongoing research into interstellar objects, which have garnered interest due to their potential to reveal new insights about the formation and composition of celestial bodies. Previous observations have shown that such objects may differ significantly from those in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue analyzing archival data from various telescopes to gain further insights into interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS, aiming to unlock more secrets of these cosmic visitors.</p>
