      <h2>Elon Musk says 3I/ATLAS could threaten human survival</h2>

<p>A mysterious object known as 3I/ATLAS is set to pass Earth on December 19 at a distance of approximately 170 million miles. Elon Musk has expressed concerns about the object, which has sparked intense debate among astronomers regarding its nature and potential risks. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as researchers continue to analyze the interstellar visitor's behaviour. Musk has urged space agencies to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely, warning that any deviation from its path could pose a grave threat to humanity. Scientists have spent months studying the object, which is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Closest Approach:</strong> December 19</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>First Detected:</strong> July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Visitors:</strong> 1I/’Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023 by astronomers with the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. It passed closest to the Sun on October 30, where observers noted non-gravitational accelerations and a radio signal linked to the object. As the object continues on its trajectory, it is expected to approach Earth on December 19.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It could be alien, I don’t know,” Musk said during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS. He warned that if the object struck the planet, it “would like obliterate a continent type of thing,” and could potentially “kill most of human life.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the anomalies detected may indicate that 3I/ATLAS “might” be some form of extraterrestrial spacecraft, placing it at a two on his UFO scale.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to be observed. The first two, 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, were also the subjects of intense scientific scrutiny. The ongoing debate regarding 3I/ATLAS reflects broader questions about the nature of such objects and their potential implications for Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Telescopes worldwide will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Researchers will monitor for any changes in its path or behaviour, as the scientific community remains engaged in discussions about its nature and potential risks.</p>
