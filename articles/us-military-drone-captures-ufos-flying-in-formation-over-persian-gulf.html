      <h2>US military drone captures UFOs flying in formation over Persian Gulf</h2>

<p>A US military drone has captured video footage of three unidentified flying objects (UFOs) flying in formation over the Persian Gulf on August 23, 2012. The one-minute recording, taken by an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US Air Force, was released this week by investigative journalist Jeremy Corbell. The footage was recorded shortly after 6 p.m. local time.</p>

<p>This incident has gained attention as UFO investigators describe the orbs as exhibiting unusual flight movements that defy basic physics. The Pentagon has classified these objects as "UAP," or Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. Corbell and co-host George Knapp have asserted that the reliability of the observation is high, as it was captured using military-grade technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: August 23, 2012</li>
    <li>Time of recording: Shortly after 6 p.m. local time</li>
    <li>Location: Persian Gulf, between Saudi Arabia and Iran</li>
    <li>Drone type: MQ-9 Reaper</li>
    <li>Footage released by: Jeremy Corbell, co-host of the podcast WEAPONIZED</li>
    <li>Pentagon classification: UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 23, 2012, an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US Air Force recorded a video of three orbs flying in formation over the Persian Gulf. The footage was later released by journalist Jeremy Corbell. In a January 30 podcast episode, Corbell and Knapp discussed the footage and its implications for UAP research.</p>

<p>In a congressional hearing on UAP on October 30, 2024, Congressman Eric Burlison presented additional evidence of UFO encounters, including footage of a missile striking an unidentified object over Yemen.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Your government has labeled this as UAP, and you have never been allowed to see this material,” said Jeremy Corbell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is an image generated by military sensors that looks like a triangular UFO... But looking at it, it's not like that,” stated George Knapp.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Persian Gulf region has emerged as a hotspot for UAP activity, with numerous reports from US Navy crews encountering bright objects in the sky. In one notable incident, a Navy ship's bridge was illuminated by an unknown object, prompting a commanding officer to shield her eyes from the brightness. The US government has stated there is no physical evidence of extraterrestrial life, despite ongoing investigations by the Pentagon's ARRO department.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP incidents are ongoing, with the Pentagon's ARRO department expected to continue reviewing and releasing information related to UFO sightings as more footage becomes available.</p>
