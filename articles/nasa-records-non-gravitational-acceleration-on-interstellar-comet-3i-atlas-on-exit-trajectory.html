      <h2>NASA records non-gravitational acceleration on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on exit trajectory</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited non-gravitational acceleration during its exit from the solar system. The observation was made as the comet passed through the inner solar system in early February 2026.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests the presence of forces acting on the comet that are not related to gravitational pull. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is currently studying the comet's trajectory to better understand the dynamics of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in December 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently on a trajectory out of the solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is leading the analysis of the comet's movement.</li>
    <li>The non-gravitational acceleration was recorded in early February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in December 2019 and has since been monitored by astronomers worldwide. In early February 2026, NASA reported that the comet displayed non-gravitational acceleration, indicating unexpected forces influencing its trajectory as it exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations of non-gravitational acceleration are important for understanding the behavior of interstellar objects,” said a spokesperson from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this observation, interstellar comets have been studied for their unique characteristics and origins. The discovery of non-gravitational forces acting on such bodies may reshape our understanding of celestial mechanics and the interactions of comets within the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS and will conduct further analysis to determine the cause of the observed acceleration. Additional data will be gathered as the comet moves further from the solar system.</p>
