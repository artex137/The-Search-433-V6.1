      <h2>Baba Vanga's prediction on alien spaceship entering Earth’s atmosphere in 2026 linked to mysterious interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Blind mystic Baba Vanga has predicted that a colossal alien spacecraft will enter Earth’s atmosphere in November 2026. This prediction has gained attention following the recent approach of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which came closest to Earth last month. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this prediction.</p>

<p>The implications of Vanga's prediction are significant, especially as it coincides with rising interest in reports of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). Authorities and scientists are closely monitoring the comet 3I/ATLAS, which has sparked various theories about its origins and nature. The European Space Agency has classified it as an interstellar object, the third of its kind observed to date.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Baba Vanga predicted an alien spacecraft will enter Earth's atmosphere in November 2026.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 270 million km from Earth as of December 19.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object identified, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Scientists have found no evidence of extraterrestrial technology from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2025, scientists discovered the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope in Chile. On December 19, 2026, the comet was recorded at a distance of 270 million km from Earth. Research teams have since studied the comet, concluding it is a natural object with unique chemical properties.</p>

<p>Baba Vanga, who passed away in 1996, has been associated with various predictions, including the forecast of humanity's first encounter with extraterrestrial life in 2026. Her predictions have resurfaced amid increasing UAP sightings and global unrest.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is not an alien spacecraft, but rather a natural comet originating from beyond our solar system,” said a group of astronomers who studied the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Baba Vanga is known for her eerie predictions, including warnings about significant global events. Her forecasts have gained traction as tensions rise internationally, particularly regarding potential conflicts involving major powers. The recent focus on UAP sightings has further fueled speculation about her predictions.</p>

<p>The predictions have attracted attention amidst global crises, including unrest in Iran and geopolitical tensions surrounding Taiwan and Russia.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and further investigate its characteristics. Authorities are assessing the implications of Vanga’s predictions in light of current global events, but no formal investigations or charges have been reported at this time.</p>
