      <h2>NASA tracks 3I/ATLAS' exit from the solar system</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is exiting the solar system after its perihelion on October 29, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS survey in Chile, 3I/ATLAS has stirred speculation about its origins, with some suggesting it could be an alien probe. However, NASA has classified it as a comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into interstellar objects and their characteristics. Researchers are continuing to study 3I/ATLAS using various telescopes to better understand its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS survey in Chile.</li>
    <li>Reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Earth flyby occurred on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million km.</li>
    <li>NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet, not an alien probe.</li>
    <li>Lead researcher Benjamin Jacobson-Bell conducted studies using the Green Bank Telescope and MeerKAT.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, marking it as the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The object reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025. Speculation about its nature arose soon after its discovery, with some suggesting it could be an alien probe due to unusual characteristics. However, NASA quickly identified it as a comet.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made a flyby of Earth, passing at a safe distance of 269 million km. Observations continued with NASA telescopes, including the Hubble and JWST, to analyze its composition and behavior. Researchers employed the Green Bank Telescope to search for any artificial signals but found none.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We all would have been thrilled to find technosignatures coming from 3I/ATLAS, but they're just not there,” said Benjamin Jacobson-Bell, lead researcher from UC Berkeley.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Finding no signals was the result we expected, due to the significant evidence for 3I/ATLAS being a comet with only natural features,” Jacobson-Bell added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The evidence was against 3I/ATLAS being one such probe, but we would have been remiss not to check,” Jacobson-Bell stated, referring to ongoing research into interstellar probes.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins a small group of interstellar objects that have been identified since the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. The study of such objects provides valuable information about the formation and evolution of the solar system and beyond. Previous studies have shown that interstellar objects often exhibit characteristics typical of comets, prompting researchers to investigate their origins further.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it exits the solar system. Ongoing studies using the James Webb Space Telescope and other instruments aim to uncover more about its origins and characteristics.</p>
