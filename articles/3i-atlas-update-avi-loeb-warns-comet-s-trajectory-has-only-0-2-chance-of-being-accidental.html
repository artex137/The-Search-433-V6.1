      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Avi Loeb Warns Comet's Trajectory Has Only 0.2% Chance of Being Accidental</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2025, according to NASA. The comet, which is only the third known interstellar visitor to pass through our solar system, poses no threat to Earth, but its unusual characteristics have sparked debate among scientists about its origins.</p>

<p>The close approach of 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity for astronomers to study its physical composition. The comet's trajectory and behavior have raised questions about whether it is a natural phenomenon or potentially engineered. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, continue to monitor and gather data from the comet using various spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will come within approximately 170 million miles of Earth.</li>
  <li>The closest approach is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</li>
  <li>The comet was first detected on July 1, 2023.</li>
  <li>The Hubble Space Telescope photographed the comet on July 21, 2023, from a distance of 277 million miles.</li>
  <li>Ongoing observations are crucial for estimating the comet's size, which is believed to range from 1,444 feet to 3.5 miles across.</li>
  <li>Avi Loeb has calculated that the comet's trajectory has only a 0.2% chance of being accidental.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023. On July 21, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet from 277 million miles away, revealing a teardrop-shaped cloud of dust around its core. After being obscured by sunlight, the comet was observed again in early October by three NASA spacecraft orbiting Mars: MRO, MAVEN, and Perseverance.</p>

<p>In October, the MRO's HiRISE camera provided clearer images of the comet's coma. Recent observations have shown a rhythmic 16.16-hour brightness cycle and an unusual chemical profile, venting high amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Given these features, it may resemble a comet in unresolved images like the ones we have of 3I/ATLAS,” said Avi Loeb. “However, a spacecraft could also display artificial lights, release excess heat from its engine or manoeuvre in unusual ways.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Observations are expected to continue for several more months as 3I/ATLAS heads out of the solar system,” NASA noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate over the nature of 3I/ATLAS has intensified, particularly due to the involvement of Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist known for his controversial views on interstellar objects. Previous interstellar visitors, such as 'Oumuamua, have also sparked discussions about the possibility of artificial origins. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretation of these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and moves toward Jupiter. Data collected by the Hubble Space Telescope and the JUICE spacecraft, which observed the comet last month, will be analyzed for insights into its composition and origins. Further observations are expected to provide more clarity on this rare cosmic visitor.</p>
