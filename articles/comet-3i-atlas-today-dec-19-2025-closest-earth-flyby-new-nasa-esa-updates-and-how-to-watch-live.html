      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Reaches Closest Approach to Earth</h2>
<p>In the early hours of December 19, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, passing at approximately 1:00 a.m. EST (06:00 GMT). The comet, which is about 1.8 astronomical units away or roughly 168 million miles (270 million kilometers), poses no threat to our planet, according to NASA.</p>

<p>This flyby is significant as it marks the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our Solar System, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Authorities have emphasized the importance of this event due to the scientific insights it provides, particularly through the data collected by NASA and partner missions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date and time of closest approach: December 19, 2025, at 1:00 a.m. EST (06:00 GMT)</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: ~1.8 AU (168 million miles or 270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Observations made by NASA’s Europa Clipper and Psyche spacecraft</li>
    <li>Comet observable in the constellation Leo, near Regulus</li>
    <li>Live coverage of the event available through the Virtual Telescope Project</li>
    <li>Comet expected to remain observable until spring 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 8-9, 2025, NASA’s Psyche spacecraft observed Comet 3I/ATLAS when it was approximately 33 million miles (53 million kilometers) away, gathering data that refined its trajectory.</p>
<p>On November 6, 2025, the Europa Clipper collected around seven hours of ultraviolet data from a distance of about 102 million miles (164 million kilometers), providing insights into the comet’s composition.</p>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and is expected to pass by Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This opportunity… was completely unexpected,” said a principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute regarding the data collected from the Europa Clipper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA has reiterated that even at its closest approach, 3I/ATLAS remains extremely far away—around 170 million miles (270 million kilometers), approximately 1.8 AU.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being an ancient traveler, estimated to be billions of years old. Its observations provide a unique opportunity to study materials from outside our Solar System, as comets preserve chemical signatures from their formation.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also drawn significant attention from the scientific community due to their rarity and the insights they offer into the formation of stars and planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue on its hyperbolic trajectory out of the Solar System and is expected to provide valuable data until it fades from view in the coming months. NASA and ESA will continue to monitor its path and gather additional observations as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
