    <li>The asteroids are expected to approach Earth this week.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</li>
    <li>Details on the exact sizes and trajectories of the asteroids have not been disclosed.</li>
    <li>The status of the comet 3I/ATLAS remains unclear.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has begun tracking the two asteroids as they approach Earth. The agency has issued statements regarding the status of the asteroids and their proximity to the planet.</p>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has also been a subject of interest, with astronomers investigating its characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA is monitoring the situation closely,” said a spokesperson from the agency. “We are taking all necessary precautions to ensure safety.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time NASA has tracked near-Earth objects. The agency regularly monitors asteroids and comets to assess any potential risks to the planet. The interest in comet 3I/ATLAS reflects ongoing efforts to study celestial bodies that may impact Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor the asteroids as they approach Earth. Further updates will be provided as more information becomes available regarding their trajectories and the status of comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>
