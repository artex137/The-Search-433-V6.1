      <h2>Harvard professor sparks wild theory: is comet 3I/Atlas actually an alien spaceship?</h2>

<p>A comet known as 3I/Atlas is passing through our solar system, stirring intrigue and speculation about its origins. First detected in July 2025, the comet reached its closest point to the sun, or perihelion, on October 29, 2025. The Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet may have an artificial origin, claiming there is a 30% to 40% chance it could be a spacecraft designed by extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<p>This theory has gained traction and raised questions about the nature of interstellar objects. While NASA experts have emphasized that 3I/Atlas poses no threat to Earth and is behaving like a typical comet, researchers are using the opportunity to study how such visitors interact with solar influence. The discussion surrounding the comet reflects ongoing interest in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Reached perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Expected to pass within 267 million kilometers of Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims a 30% to 40% chance it could be a spacecraft.</li>
    <li>NASA confirms 3I/Atlas is a natural interstellar comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first detected in July 2025, capturing the attention of scientists and the public alike. It reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, a significant event for research into interstellar objects. Following this, Avi Loeb has made public statements about the potential for the comet to be an artificial object, leading to widespread debate.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/Atlas is expected to come within 267 million kilometers of Earth, prompting further interest in its trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While 3I/Atlas exhibits intriguing behavior, it’s a natural object that poses no threat to Earth,” said NASA experts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There’s a 30% to 40% chance the object might be a ‘spacecraft’ designed by extraterrestrial intelligence,” stated Avi Loeb in a recent interview.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/Atlas is part of a broader conversation about the existence of extraterrestrial life and the nature of interstellar objects. Previous discoveries, such as the interstellar object Oumuamua in 2017, have also prompted speculation about alien technology. However, scientific consensus maintains that these objects are natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As researchers continue to study 3I/Atlas, they will gather data on its behavior as it approaches the sun. NASA will monitor its trajectory to confirm its classification as a natural comet, while discussions about its potential origins are likely to continue in both scientific and public forums.</p>
