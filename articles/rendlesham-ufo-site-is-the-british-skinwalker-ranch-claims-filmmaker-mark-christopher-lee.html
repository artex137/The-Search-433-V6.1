      <h2>Rendlesham UFO site is the British Skinwalker Ranch, claims filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee</h2>

<p>Filmmakers Mark Christopher Lee and Roderick Goodman have claimed that the Rendlesham Forest, the site of the UK's most famous UFO incident, is experiencing phenomena similar to activities reported at Skinwalker Ranch in Utah. The assertions were made on 23 October 2025 during the promotion of Lee's latest film, <em>The Rendlesham UFO: The British Roswell</em>.</p>

<p>This claim is significant as it revives interest in the Rendlesham incident, which occurred in December 1980 and involved multiple sightings of unexplained lights near two United States Air Force bases. Authorities have not disclosed any current investigations related to these recent claims, but the filmmakers indicate that they have encountered unexplained phenomena during their research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: December 1980</li>
    <li>Location: Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, England</li>
    <li>Filmmakers: Mark Christopher Lee and Roderick Goodman</li>
    <li>Film title: <em>The Rendlesham UFO: The British Roswell</em></li>
    <li>Key findings: Electronic noises, unexplained orbs, howling sounds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980, when multiple military personnel reported seeing unexplained lights. Over the years, it has been the focal point of various investigations and documentaries.</p>
<p>On 23 October 2025, Lee and Goodman claimed that their investigations in the forest have revealed ongoing unexplained phenomena, likening it to the notorious Skinwalker Ranch.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is something going on there which can't be explained,” said Mark Christopher Lee. “We found some really strange stuff, strange electronic noises and stuff that couldn’t be explained.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Roderick Goodman added, “What we found was weird, something we still can’t explain. It’s as if the forest itself is alive with mystery.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Rendlesham Forest incident is often referred to as the UK's equivalent of the Roswell incident in the United States. It has been the subject of multiple investigations, documentaries, and public interest over the years. Skinwalker Ranch, known for its paranormal activity, has drawn comparisons due to the nature of the phenomena reported in both locations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
