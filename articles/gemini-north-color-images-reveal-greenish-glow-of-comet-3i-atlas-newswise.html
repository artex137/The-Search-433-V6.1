      <h2>Gemini North Color Images Reveal Greenish Glow of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The Gemini North telescope has captured color images of Comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a distinct greenish glow, according to the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Gemini Observatory. The images were taken in early November 2023 at the observatory located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers and the public as it provides a visual confirmation of the comet's chemical composition and activity. The green hue is attributed to the presence of diatomic carbon (C2), a common feature in many comets. Researchers are continuing to monitor the comet as it approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: Early November 2023</li>
    <li>Telescope: Gemini North, located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii</li>
    <li>Significant feature: Greenish glow due to diatomic carbon (C2)</li>
    <li>Agency involved: National Science Foundation's Gemini Observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early November 2023, the Gemini North telescope conducted observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS. The resulting images revealed a greenish glow, which researchers attribute to diatomic carbon present in the comet's coma. This observation marks an important step in understanding the comet's composition and behavior as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The images provide insights into the chemical makeup of the comet, enhancing our understanding of its activity,” said a spokesperson for the NSF’s Gemini Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2020. It has since garnered attention due to its unique characteristics and trajectory. The study of comets like 3I/ATLAS contributes to the broader understanding of the solar system and the materials that form it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, which is expected to occur in early 2024. This ongoing study will help provide further insights into cometary behavior and composition.</p>
