      <h2>3I/ATLAS Changes Shape, Splits Apart, and Moves Toward Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has attracted significant attention following claims that it has changed shape, split apart, and is moving toward Earth. Scientists and the public have raised questions about these developments, particularly as the object approaches Earth in December 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>Authorities, including astronomers and space agencies, are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as new images and reports suggest unusual activity surrounding the object. Observations are set to intensify as the object nears its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, allowing for detailed study by ground-based telescopes, including the Hubble and Webb telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>3I/ATLAS is projected to come within 1.33 astronomical units (AU) of Earth by December 19, 2025.</li>
<li>On November 10, 2025, social media claims suggested the object emitted energy in geometric patterns.</li>
<li>New observations indicated that 3I/ATLAS has lost about 16% of its mass due to jets extending up to 1 million kilometers.</li>
<li>The object has a diameter of 5.6 kilometers, according to the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
<li>Scientists have calculated a non-gravitational acceleration of 5.85×10⁻⁵ au/day² for 3I/ATLAS.</li>
<li>3I/ATLAS may have fragmented into at least 16 pieces, similar to the Shoemaker-Levi 9 breakup in 1994.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 10, 2025, a social media post claimed that 3I/ATLAS had transformed into a glowing green object without a visible tail. This claim was followed by reports of new jets firing from the object.</p>
<p>As scientists analyzed the data, they observed that the jets had extended significantly and suggested that the object may have experienced fragmentation. These findings prompted discussions regarding the object's nature and trajectory.</p>
<p>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, providing an opportunity for further observations and analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The claims regarding 3I/ATLAS have not been verified by official space agencies,” scientists said, emphasizing the need for caution in interpreting the data.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being more massive than the interstellar object 1I/‘Oumuamua, raising questions about its origin and trajectory. Earlier studies have indicated that such large objects entering the inner solar system are rare, occurring roughly once every ten thousand years.</p>
<p>Some researchers have proposed that artificial propulsion could explain the object’s motion, suggesting that advanced technologies might be responsible for the observed jets and mass loss.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will conduct detailed observations to determine whether the object remains intact or has fragmented. Future spectroscopic studies will analyze the jets to clarify the object's composition and behavior.</p>
