      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I⧸ATLAS - What NASA Knows So Far</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I⧸ATLAS has been discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope, according to NASA. The announcement was made on December 4, 2025, as scientists continue to study the comet's trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first interstellar comet detected in our solar system. NASA officials are gathering data to learn more about the comet's origin and composition, which could provide insights into the formation of other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of discovery: December 4, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovery made by: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Type of celestial object: Interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Current study by: NASA</li>
    <li>Potential insights: Formation of celestial bodies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has confirmed that the comet 3I⧸ATLAS was identified on December 4, 2025. The discovery was made by the ATLAS survey telescope, which is designed to detect near-Earth objects and other celestial events.</p>

<p>Scientists have begun analyzing data related to the comet's path and physical properties. This analysis aims to determine the comet's trajectory within our solar system and its potential origin from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I⧸ATLAS opens a new chapter in our understanding of interstellar objects,” said a NASA spokesperson. “We are excited to learn more about its characteristics and what it can tell us about the universe.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I⧸ATLAS, other interstellar objects have been detected, including 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017. These findings have sparked interest in studying objects that originate from outside our solar system, potentially offering clues about the formation of planets and stars.</p>

<p>NASA and other space agencies have increased their efforts to monitor and study such celestial phenomena, enhancing our knowledge of the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to study comet 3I⧸ATLAS and plans to release further findings as data becomes available. Scientists are particularly interested in understanding its composition and trajectory as it travels through our solar system.</p>
