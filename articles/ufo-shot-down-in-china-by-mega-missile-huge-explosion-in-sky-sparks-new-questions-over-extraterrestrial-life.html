      <h2>UFO 'shot down' in China by mega missile</h2>

<p>A bright explosion recorded over Shandong Province, China, on Friday, September 12, has drawn international attention after a missile appeared to strike an unidentified flying object (UFO). According to reports, residents captured video of a slow-moving object flying near the ground before it disintegrated in a fiery flash, scattering debris across the area. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The incident has raised questions about aerial threats and military readiness. Authorities have not issued an official statement confirming the nature of the object or the cause of its destruction. The explosion coincided with scheduled military exercises in the nearby Bohai Sea, where China had announced the use of live weapons.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred at approximately 21:00 local time on September 12, 2025.</li>
    <li>Location: Near the cities of Weifang and Rizhao, Shandong Province, China.</li>
    <li>Video footage shows a red fireball resembling a surface-to-air missile striking the object.</li>
    <li>Two explosions were audible following the missile strike.</li>
    <li>No official confirmation from Chinese authorities regarding the object's identity or nature.</li>
    <li>The incident coincided with military exercises in the Bohai Sea.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 12, 2025, around 21:00 local time, residents in Shandong Province reported seeing a slow-moving object in the sky. Video footage shared on social media shows a missile striking the object, resulting in a bright explosion and debris scattering across the area. The event coincided with live-fire military exercises being conducted by China in the Bohai Sea.</p>

<p>Following the explosion, observers noted that the object's behavior differed from that of a typical meteor, as it traveled parallel to the ground at a lower speed. The incident has sparked widespread speculation on social media, with theories ranging from a drone or missile test to a potential UFO.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object’s behavior did not resemble a natural meteor,” an observer stated, highlighting the unusual characteristics of the incident.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident occurs amid increased military activity in the Pacific, with both U.S. and Chinese forces conducting multiple live-fire drills in 2025. The timing of the explosion has led to speculation regarding its potential links to broader defense testing or missile capabilities. Analysts have suggested that the object may have been a test target used in military exercises.</p>

<p>Previous incidents involving unidentified aerial phenomena have drawn significant attention, including a U.S. Congress release in October 2024 showing a military drone striking a UFO off the coast of Yemen. Unlike the Shandong incident, that object continued to move after being hit, while the Chinese video shows complete destruction.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident are ongoing, with authorities expected to review the footage and assess the implications for military readiness and aerial defense capabilities. Further announcements from Chinese officials are anticipated, though no timeline for these statements has been disclosed.</p>
