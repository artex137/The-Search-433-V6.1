      <h2>Images of 3I/ATLAS on November 22–24, 2025</h2>

<p>Images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS have been captured from November 22 to 24, 2025, by amateur astronomers and astrophotographers, showing significant details about its structure. The observations occurred while 3I/ATLAS was approximately 300 million kilometers from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is notable as it provides valuable insights into the behavior and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited a glowing coma and a distinct anti-tail. Authorities and researchers are currently analyzing these images to better understand the object's composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation dates: November 22–24, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 300 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Best image taken: November 22, 2025, at 19:25 UTC</li>
    <li>Image captured by: Mitsunori Tsumura using a 0.5-meter telescope</li>
    <li>Estimated tail length: 5 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated mass loss: a few billion tons over the past two months</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 22, 2025, Mitsunori Tsumura captured the best image of 3I/ATLAS at 19:25 UTC. Over the following days, additional images were taken, consistently showing the object’s glowing coma and well-defined tail.</p>
<p>The observations indicate that the anti-tail extends approximately one million kilometers towards the Sun, suggesting significant momentum flux and interaction with the solar wind.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The huge extent of the anti-tail implies that it carries a large enough momentum flux to penetrate through the solar wind,” said Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation of 3I/ATLAS follows previous studies indicating its unique properties as an interstellar object. The analyses have raised questions about its origins and the processes affecting its trajectory as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further spectroscopic measurements to assess the speed of jets emitted by 3I/ATLAS and to differentiate between natural sublimation and potential technological thrusters affecting its movement.</p>
