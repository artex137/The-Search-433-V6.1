      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas Reaches 57 km/s on Hyperbolic Path</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that Comet 3I/Atlas, the third interstellar object detected in the solar system, is on a hyperbolic escape route, freeing itself from the Sun’s gravitational pull. The comet, discovered in July 2025, recently achieved a speed of 57 km/s, surpassing its predecessor, 'Oumuamua, which recorded 26 km/s.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it allows scientists to study the composition of distant star systems. Global observatories, including the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb, are monitoring the comet, which reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. The data collected during this transition will enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Reached a speed of 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Safe distance from the Sun was approximately 210 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object recorded, after 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Expected to leave the solar system in a few weeks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025. It reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. Following this, astronomers have predicted that the comet will exit the solar system within weeks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The hyperbolic trajectory is the signature of an object not gravitationally bound to our solar system,” said a spokesperson from the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN).</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The kinetic energy of 3I/Atlas is greater than the solar attraction force, preventing its capture,” noted a lead researcher involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is part of a growing list of interstellar objects, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unique chemical composition and high speed provide valuable insights into the origins and evolution of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas as it travels through interstellar space, refining its orbital data and studying its chemical composition to enhance knowledge of the universe's history.</p>
