      <h2>Astronomer snaps first look at Comet 3I/ATLAS after Sun encounter: Here’s what we know</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed from Earth again after its recent passage behind the Sun, according to astronomer Qicheng Zhang. The images were captured using the Lowell Discovery Telescope in Arizona on October 31, 2025, following the comet's perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, which occurred on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks the first post-perihelion optical image of an interstellar comet. Unlike typical comets from our solar system, interstellar comets, like 3I/ATLAS, originate from other star systems and travel through our solar system in hyperbolic orbits. Zhang noted that standard amateur telescopes can now detect comets across most of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was last seen before its perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at over <strong>130,000 mph</strong> (approximately <strong>210,000 km/h</strong>).</li>
    <li>It came within <strong>1.4 astronomical units</strong> (about <strong>130 million miles</strong> or <strong>210 million kilometers</strong>) of the Sun.</li>
    <li>The images were captured by Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Lowell Observatory.</li>
    <li>The observations were made using the Discovery Telescope located in Arizona.</li>
    <li>The new images were taken while the comet was approximately <strong>16 degrees</strong> away from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. It performed a gravity assist around the Sun, leading to its perihelion on October 29, 2025. After this event, Zhang captured the first optical images of the comet on October 31, 2025, as it reappeared in the sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Standard amateur telescopes can now spot comets across most of the Northern Hemisphere,” said Qicheng Zhang regarding the visibility of Comet 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation adds to the growing understanding of interstellar objects. Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following previous discoveries that have sparked interest in studying celestial bodies from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, gathering additional data to better understand its origins and characteristics.</p>
