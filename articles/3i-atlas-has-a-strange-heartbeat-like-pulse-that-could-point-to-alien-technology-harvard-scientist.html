      <h2>3I/ATLAS has a strange ‘heartbeat’-like pulse that could point to alien technology: Harvard scientist</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has suggested that comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits a “heartbeat”-like pulse, which may indicate artificial origins, potentially linked to spacecraft technology. Loeb shared these insights in a recent blog post and an interview with the New York Post, stating that the comet's light blinks in a regular cycle every 16.16 hours.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges current understandings of comets and raises questions about the potential for extraterrestrial technology. Loeb argues that the periodic modulation of light from 3I/ATLAS could be explained by jets of gas and dust, rather than the comet's nucleus. NASA has maintained its position that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Light pulses every 16.16 hours, resembling a “heartbeat.”</li>
    <li>Study published in the journal “Astronomy and Physics” over the summer.</li>
    <li>Hubble Space Telescope image taken on July 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>Next close approach to Jupiter expected in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered, and its unique characteristics were noted shortly after. Loeb documented his findings in a blog post, where he discussed the comet's light patterns and their implications for understanding its origins. A Hubble Space Telescope image captured on July 21 provided further insights into the comet’s behavior.</p>

<p>Loeb has speculated that the comet's unusual trajectory may suggest it is designed to gather information for an extraterrestrial civilization. NASA reiterated its stance that 3I/ATLAS is a comet during a photo release event in Maryland two weeks ago.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Therefore the periodic modulation of its light must originate from its puffs of gas and dust that scatter sunlight around it.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also claimed, “It might have fine-tuned its trajectory with the help of [artificial] thrusters.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nasa has maintained that “3I/ATLAS is a comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This analysis of 3I/ATLAS contributes to ongoing debates regarding the origins of interstellar objects. Previous claims about potential extraterrestrial technology have often been met with skepticism in the scientific community. Loeb's theories are part of a broader discourse on the nature of unidentified celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are expected as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026. Researchers aim to determine whether the comet's jets are natural or artificial, potentially providing more clarity on its origins.</p>
