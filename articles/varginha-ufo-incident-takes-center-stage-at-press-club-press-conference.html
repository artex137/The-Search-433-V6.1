      <h2>‘Varginha UFO Incident’ Takes Center Stage at Press Club Press Conference</h2>

<p>On January 20, 1996, at approximately 3:30 PM, residents of Varginha, Brazil, reported seeing a cigar-shaped object fall from the sky. The incident has since been dubbed Brazil’s “Roswell Incident.” No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the event.</p>

<p>The significance of this incident has resurfaced as it was the focus of a press conference held by filmmaker James Fox at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 2026. The conference featured firsthand witnesses and discussions about government transparency regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP).</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 20, 1996, several residents of Varginha observed a cigar-shaped object falling from the sky. Shortly after, three young women, including two school teachers, encountered a strange creature in a courtyard. They reported the creature had brown, oily skin and bright red eyes.</p>

<p>In the hours following the sighting, the Brazilian military arrived at the scene and sealed the area. Witnesses reported being told to remain quiet, with some claiming to have been approached by unidentified men. The object was later said to have been transferred to various locations and allegedly handed over to U.S. representatives.</p>

<p>The press conference on January 20, 2026, addressed these events, featuring discussions from witnesses and U.S. intelligence insiders about the implications of crash retrievals and biological programs related to the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The events of Jan. 20, 1996, are like the scene of a movie that plays in my head all the time,” said Carlos de Souza, recalling his experience from the day of the incident.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “I thought, if there’s a pilot on board, he could be in deep trouble. So I got in my car and followed its trajectory toward the crash site,” de Souza added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Varginha incident has been a point of interest for over three decades, drawing comparisons to other notable UFO events. The secrecy surrounding the incident has fueled speculation and conspiracy theories regarding government involvement and knowledge of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>The recent press conference has reignited discussions about the need for greater transparency in military and governmental dealings regarding UAPs. Calls for expanded whistleblower protections have been prominent among speakers and attendees.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the press conference, there are ongoing discussions regarding potential investigations into the Varginha incident and the broader implications for UAP transparency. The next steps include continued advocacy for government disclosure and support for whistleblower programs.</p>
