      <h2>Brian Cox Addresses Interstellar Comet Signal Claims Amid MAVEN Silence</h2>

<p>NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft has remained silent since December 6, 2025, after losing contact during a routine orbital pass behind Mars. This communication lapse has coincided with public comments by Professor Brian Cox regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has sparked speculation about potential non-natural radio emissions.</p>

<p>The situation has raised concerns among scientists and space agencies about the implications of increasing terrestrial radio interference on deep-space research. Authorities are currently working to restore communication with MAVEN while clarifying the nature of the signals associated with 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Last successful telemetry from MAVEN was received on December 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>Professor Brian Cox addressed the situation regarding 3I/ATLAS on December 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nine candidate signals from 3I/ATLAS were identified as terrestrial radio interference.</li>
    <li>MAVEN has been operational for over 10 years, studying Mars since its arrival in 2014.</li>
    <li>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) plans to attempt a high-gain antenna reset during the next optimal alignment window.</li>
    <li>If MAVEN does not respond by early January 2026, its operational status may be reclassified.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 6, 2025, MAVEN lost communication during a standard orbital pass behind Mars. Following this, speculation arose about signals from the comet 3I/ATLAS. On December 29, 2025, Professor Brian Cox clarified that the signals were human-made interference, not emissions from the comet. NASA has since been working to restore telemetry with MAVEN.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reality of space exploration is often found in the mundane challenges of physics and orbital mechanics,” Cox stated during a recent scientific address.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Cox emphasized that the “human noise” masking the comet’s signature is a direct result of the lack of stricter EPFD limits and sustainability metrics for commercial satellite constellations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The increasing density of low-Earth orbit radio traffic poses challenges for isolating high-value deep-space data. The identification of the signals as terrestrial interference illustrates the growing complexity of Space Traffic Management (STM) as more satellites enter orbit. MAVEN has been a critical asset in studying the Martian atmosphere and its interaction with solar phenomena since its mission began.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA engineers will attempt a high-gain antenna reset during the next optimal alignment window. If there is no response from MAVEN by early January 2026, the agency may need to reassess the mission's operational status.</p>
