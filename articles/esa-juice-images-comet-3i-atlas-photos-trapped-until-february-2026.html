      <h2>ESA JUICE Images: Comet 3I/ATLAS Photos Trapped Until February 2026</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s (ESA) JUICE spacecraft has captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS between November 2 and November 25, 2023, but these images will not be available to the public until February 2026, due to operational constraints. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This delay is significant because it highlights the challenges of space exploration and data transmission. ESA's JUICE mission aims to explore the moons of Jupiter, but the need to manage thermal conditions has restricted data downlink capabilities. The images captured could provide valuable insights into the comet's composition, which is of great interest to scientists worldwide.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>JUICE observed the comet from November 2 to November 25, 2023.</li>
    <li>The images will be unavailable until February 2026.</li>
    <li>JUICE is currently close to the Sun, affecting its data transmission rate.</li>
    <li>ESA used five instruments for remote sensing of the comet.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Mars was 19 million miles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Between November 2 and November 25, 2023, ESA's JUICE spacecraft captured images of the comet while en route to Jupiter. However, due to thermal management requirements, the data will not be transmitted to Earth until February 2026.</p>

<p>NASA's Perseverance Rover also captured images of the comet from the Martian surface during its close approach, marking a significant milestone as the first interstellar comet photographed from another planet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All this campaign was unexpected for everybody! For JUICE, indeed, we are in a cruise phase during which there are thermal constraints. Therefore, no payload activities were expected to take place at this moment.”</blockquote>
<p>— Olivier Witasse, ESA Project Scientist</p>

<blockquote>“As JUICE is currently close to the Sun, it is using its main high-gain antenna as a heat shield. It is using its smaller medium-gain antenna to send data back to Earth at a much lower rate.”</blockquote>
<p>— ESA statement</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time spacecraft have faced challenges in data transmission due to thermal constraints. Similar issues occurred during previous missions, such as when spacecraft were in proximity to the Sun or other heat sources. The JUICE mission, designed for the cold environment of Jupiter, must adapt to intense solar heat during its transit.</p>

<p>ESA's Rosetta mission, which successfully landed on comet 67P in 2014, has paved the way for future missions like the Comet Interceptor, aimed at visiting pristine comets and potentially interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will await the data from JUICE until February 2026. Meanwhile, ESA continues to develop the Comet Interceptor mission, which may enable more timely observations of comets in the future.</p>
