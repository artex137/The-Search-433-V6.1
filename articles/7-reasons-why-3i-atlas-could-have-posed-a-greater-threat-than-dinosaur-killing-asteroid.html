      <h2>7 reasons why 3I/ATLAS could have posed a greater threat than dinosaur-killing asteroid</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, moving at unprecedented speeds, has raised concerns among scientists about its potential threat to Earth. If on a collision course, experts say its impact could exceed the mass extinction event that killed the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. The object is currently traveling through space, with no specific impact date disclosed.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights the limitations of current planetary defense systems in responding to high-speed interstellar objects. Authorities and scientists are urging for enhanced monitoring and preparedness to address potential threats from similar cosmic anomalies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS has a nucleus over 3 miles wide.</li>
  <li>Its mass exceeds 33 billion tons.</li>
  <li>It travels at roughly 130,000 mph (209,000 km/h).</li>
  <li>The object could release energy greater than thousands of nuclear bombs upon impact.</li>
  <li>Its path brings it near Mars, Venus, and Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed moving through the solar system, with scientists noting its speed and trajectory. Its interstellar origin presents a unique challenge for predicting its path and potential interactions with other celestial bodies.</p>
<p>Observations have indicated anomalous movements, suggesting that 3I/ATLAS may accelerate unexpectedly, complicating any potential defense strategies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS acts as a cosmic wake-up call. If such a high-speed, massive interstellar object were on a collision course with Earth, it would test humanity’s planetary defense capabilities like never before,” a leading astrophysicist stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior incidents involving near-Earth objects have prompted discussions on planetary defense. The challenges presented by high-speed interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS underscore the need for improved detection and response systems to safeguard Earth from potential threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and assess its trajectory. Discussions on enhancing planetary defense capabilities are ongoing, with no specific deadlines or upcoming actions disclosed.</p>
