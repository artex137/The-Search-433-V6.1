      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Its Closest Approach to Earth Is 700 Times Further Than The Moon</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles. The comet, which is the third object confirmed to have originated from outside our solar system, poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA.</p>

<p>This close encounter is significant for astronomers, as it provides a unique opportunity to study the comet's composition and trajectory before it leaves the solar system again. Observations are being conducted globally, with NASA leading the effort using various spacecraft and Earth-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Speed: up to 246,000 kilometres per hour</li>
    <li>Nucleus diameter: estimated between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres</li>
    <li>First spotted: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Closest point to the sun (perihelion): October 29, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. Following this, the comet reached its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2025, passing just inside the orbit of Mars. It is now on its outbound journey, with its closest approach to Earth occurring on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>NASA and other astronomers have been actively monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics since its discovery, utilizing advanced telescopes for detailed observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Understanding these cosmic wanderers provides invaluable data on how material is exchanged between star systems throughout the Milky Way,” said a NASA spokesperson.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These previous visitors have sparked significant scientific interest and research into the origins and behaviour of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches, astronomers will continue their observations to gather as much data as possible before it departs. Local observatories and organized skywatching events will provide opportunities for the public to view this rare cosmic event.</p>
