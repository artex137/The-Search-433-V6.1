      <h2>New 3I/ATLAS image raises alarming questions as comet breaks known physics rules</h2>

<p>New observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have sparked scientific controversy following the release of an image showing an unusually thin, straight, and sharply defined tail. The photograph, taken on November 22, 2025, by astrophotographer Mitsunori Tsumura, has raised questions about the comet's behaviour, which appears to defy established comet physics.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges current understandings of comet behaviour. Experts have noted that the tail's characteristics differ markedly from those of typical comet tails, prompting renewed interest and study from researchers and space enthusiasts. The implications of these findings could reshape the scientific community's understanding of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The latest image was captured on November 22, 2025, and released on November 28, 2025.</li>
    <li>The tail of 3I/ATLAS is described as unusually thin and straight.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has raised concerns about the comet's characteristics.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is reported to be multiple times larger than previous interstellar objects.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is travelling faster than both 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The probability of the observed combination of characteristics occurring by chance is estimated at less than 0.1 percent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. On November 22, 2025, Mitsunori Tsumura captured a new image of the comet, which displayed a straight and sharply defined tail. This image was made public on November 28, 2025, igniting discussions among astronomers and space enthusiasts regarding the comet's unusual behaviour.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has since provided insights into the comet's characteristics, noting its size and speed compared to previously detected interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The tail exhibits no apparent curvature and does not expand with range, which are characteristics of standard comet behaviour,” said an unnamed astronomer involved in the analysis.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The probability of such a combination happening by chance is less than 0.1 percent,” stated Avi Loeb regarding the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar visitor to our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The unusual features of 3I/ATLAS have reignited interest in the study of interstellar comets and their potential implications for our understanding of celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are expected to continue their investigations into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, examining its tail's composition and behaviour in detail. Further observations may provide additional insights into the comet's nature and the possibility of it being artificially formed.</p>
