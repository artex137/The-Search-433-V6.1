      <h2>‘Alien’ 3I/ATLAS hurtling towards solar system: What we know about the interstellar comet that has piqued curiosity</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS is currently hurtling through the solar system, providing astronomers with a unique opportunity to study material that formed around another star. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile, this comet is the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following 'Oumuamua' in 2017 and 'Borisov' in 2019.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it offers insights into the materials and conditions of other star systems. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic orbit, indicating it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun and will exit the solar system after its brief passage. The European Space Agency (ESA) has reported that the comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, coming within approximately 270 million kilometres, a distance that poses no threat to our planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>First Images:</strong> Captured by Tianwen-1 on October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus Size:</strong> Estimated to be no larger than 5.6 kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Observing Agency:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and China National Space Administration (CNSA)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, NASA confirmed its hyperbolic orbit, indicating it is not bound to the Sun. The comet approached Mars on October 3, 2025, where it was successfully photographed by the Chinese Mars orbiter, Tianwen-1.</p>
<p>Recent observations from October 31 to November 4, 2025, indicated that the comet has shed a significant amount of mass and displayed signs of non-gravitational acceleration. These observations have contributed to ongoing studies regarding its composition and behavior as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Tianwen-1 orbiter successfully observed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS using its high-resolution camera from a distance of about 30 million kilometres,” said the China National Space Administration (CNSA) in a statement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Preliminary data suggests that 3I/ATLAS is an active comet composed of volatile materials similar to those found in solar system comets,” stated NASA Planetary Science Division.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following the discoveries of 'Oumuamua' and 'Borisov'. The study of such objects provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory through the solar system, astronomers will monitor its path and behavior. Further studies are expected to focus on its composition and the effects of solar radiation on its materials.</p>
