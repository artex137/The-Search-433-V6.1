      <h2>Bank of England Warned: Expert Claims Alien Disclosure Will Spark Immediate Riots</h2>

<p>Helen McCaw, a former senior analyst at the Bank of England, has warned that official confirmation of extraterrestrial life could lead to immediate riots and economic turmoil. McCaw, who worked in financial security for a decade, presented her concerns to Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, emphasizing the need for contingency planning.</p>

<p>McCaw's warning highlights the potential for psychological shock and panic withdrawal from banks following an alien disclosure. She argues that the interconnectedness of the financial system could lead to rapid deterioration of civil order and supply chains. Authorities are urged to consider the implications of such a disclosure seriously.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Helen McCaw is a former senior analyst at the Bank of England.</li>
    <li>She has worked in financial security for a decade.</li>
    <li>McCaw has warned of potential riots and economic collapse following alien disclosure.</li>
    <li>She has contacted Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, regarding her concerns.</li>
    <li>McCaw cites the need for immediate professional scrutiny of the financial system's vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2021, McCaw's interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena intensified after reading a NASA publication by Dr. Richard Stothers. This research shifted her perspective from viewing UFOs as entertainment to serious subjects worth investigation.</p>

<p>In the following years, declassified CIA documents revealed that U.S. intelligence has suspected the existence of extraterrestrial bases on Earth, monitoring locations such as Mount Hayes in Alaska and underwater zones near Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.</p>

<p>Recently, McCaw has documented potential scenarios where the financial system could collapse in the wake of an alien disclosure. She has outlined how panic withdrawals and disruptions in supply chains could occur within days.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You'll have rioting because people can't fill their cars up with fuel or buy food,” McCaw explained. “Even if you feel it's very likely, it's madness not to consider it and plan.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>McCaw's colleagues have expressed skepticism regarding her claims, with one former analyst hoping to never live in a world where such a disclosure occurs. Despite this, McCaw's educational background and professional experience lend her assertions a degree of credibility.</p>

<p>Previous incidents of mass panic, such as bank runs and supply chain disruptions during crises, provide context for McCaw's concerns about the potential consequences of an alien disclosure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>McCaw emphasizes the urgency for financial institutions to assess their vulnerabilities in light of her warnings. She advocates for immediate planning rather than delaying discussions for a future date.</p>
