      <h2>US military images capture three orb-shaped UFOs over Persian Gulf</h2>

<p>Three orb-shaped unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) have been recorded flying in formation over the Persian Gulf by a US military drone on August 23, 2012, shortly after 6:00 PM local time. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this incident.</p>

<p>This recording has reignited discussions about aerial surveillance in the sensitive area between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Military officials are examining the implications of these sightings, as they could affect regional security and airspace control.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: August 23, 2012</li>
    <li>Time of recording: Shortly after 6:00 PM local time</li>
    <li>Location: Persian Gulf, between Saudi Arabia and Iran</li>
    <li>Type of drone: MQ-9 Reaper, operated by the United States Air Force</li>
    <li>Observation method: Infrared sensors</li>
    <li>Classification: UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomena)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 23, 2012, an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the United States Air Force recorded three orb-shaped objects flying in formation over the Persian Gulf. The video captured the orbs making abrupt changes in position, with one orb appearing to fall behind before regaining its place in the formation. The recording lasted about one minute.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that military personnel have previously observed bright objects in the region, raising concerns about airspace control. An earlier incident involved a military drone engaging a target with a missile, which was ineffective against a similar orb.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The central point... is the effect on the security radar, because it involves military sensors and a region where every signal alters decisions,” according to WEAPONIZED, an investigative podcast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is no physical evidence recovered that proves the existence of UFOs or extraterrestrial beings,” stated an official source.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Persian Gulf is a strategically significant area where military operations and surveillance are commonplace. Prior incidents involving military sightings of unidentified objects have heightened tensions and scrutiny over airspace management. The classification of UAP has replaced the term UFO in official communications, reflecting a shift in how these phenomena are approached by military agencies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to analyze the implications of these sightings on regional security. Investigations into similar incidents may follow, but specific timelines or outcomes have not been disclosed.</p>
