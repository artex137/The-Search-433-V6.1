      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Flyby: Interstellar Visitor Zooms Past Earth Today Before It Is Gone</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to Earth today, December 19, 2025, at 06:00 GMT. The comet, discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile, is currently 170 million miles (273 million km) away from our planet, posing no risk of impact, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>This flyby marks a significant event as 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system. It is a unique object, composed of ancient ices, and offers scientists a glimpse into the chemical signatures of a distant star system. Observers have noted that this is likely the last opportunity to view the comet before it disappears into the cosmos.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 06:00 GMT</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 170 million miles (273 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Estimated between 440 meters and 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 153,000 miles per hour (246,000 kph)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Next Encounter:</strong> Near Jupiter on March 12, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The journey of 3I/ATLAS began with its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Since then, it has captured the attention of scientists and astronomers worldwide. The comet reached its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2025, where it began to fade in brightness.</p>
<p>Today, it has made its closest approach to Earth, allowing for one last observation before it continues on its path through the solar system. Following this flyby, the comet will head towards Jupiter, with a significant encounter scheduled for March 12, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is a fascinating object, offering us a glimpse into the materials from which our solar system formed,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “It is a unique opportunity for researchers and amateur astronomers alike.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike asteroids from our own Asteroid Belt, interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS provide valuable insights into the conditions of distant star systems and the formation of planetary bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will closely monitor its trajectory and fading visibility. The comet is expected to cross back into interstellar space by the mid-2030s, marking the end of its brief visit to our solar system.</p>
