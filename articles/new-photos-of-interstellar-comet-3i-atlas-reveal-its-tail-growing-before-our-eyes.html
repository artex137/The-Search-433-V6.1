      <h2>New photos of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveal its tail growing before our eyes</h2>

<p>New images of interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> show its tail developing as it approaches the sun, with a close encounter with Earth expected this fall. The comet, which is approximately 11 kilometers (7 miles) wide, was first observed in early July and is now moving through the solar system from beyond the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars.</p>

<p>Authorities and scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it draws nearer to the sun. The comet's tail is forming as its nucleus absorbs solar radiation, causing it to release more particles. This phenomenon is significant for astronomers studying the comet's origins and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet size:</strong> Approximately 11 kilometers (7 miles) wide.</li>
    <li><strong>First observed:</strong> Early July 2023.</li>
    <li><strong>Current speed:</strong> Over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the sun:</strong> October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li><strong>Closest distance to Earth:</strong> December 2023, within 275 million km (170 million miles).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in early July 2023. Observations from the Gemini South telescope in Chile on August 27 provided detailed images of the comet's developing tail. The comet is on a trajectory that will see it reach its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2023, before making its closest approach to Earth in December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder," said <strong>Karen Meech</strong>, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii and part of the Gemini observatories team.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. Initial observations suggest that 3I/ATLAS is likely much older than the solar system. Its unusual activity has prompted increased interest from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers plan to continue observing 3I/ATLAS closely over the next year to gather more information about its composition and origins, particularly its unusually high levels of water and carbon dioxide compared to other known comets.</p>
