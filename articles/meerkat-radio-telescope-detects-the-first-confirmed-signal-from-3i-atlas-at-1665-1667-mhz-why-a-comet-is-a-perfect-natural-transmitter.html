      <h2>MeerKAT Radio Telescope Detects The First Confirmed Signal From 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A radio telescope in South Africa has detected what may be the first confirmed signal from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. The MeerKAT Observatory recorded hydroxyl (OH) absorption lines at frequencies of 1665.4018 and 1667.3590 megahertz on October 24, five days before the comet's closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it occurs in the “water hole” frequencies, which scientists have long proposed for interstellar communication. The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory reported that the signal showed absorption rather than emission, indicating a unique interaction with solar radiation. Researchers plan to continue monitoring the object as Earth approaches its closest point on December 19.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detection Date: October 24, 2023</li>
    <li>Frequencies Detected: 1665.4018 MHz and 1667.3590 MHz</li>
    <li>Next Checkpoint: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: MeerKAT Observatory, Karoo plain, South Africa</li>
    <li>Agency: South African Radio Astronomy Observatory</li>
    <li>Astrophysicist: Avi Loeb</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 24, 2023, the MeerKAT Observatory in South Africa detected narrow-band hydroxyl absorption lines from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. This detection occurred just five days before the object’s perihelion, when it was closest to the Sun. The team plans to monitor the object continuously as Earth approaches its closest point to 3I/ATLAS on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Five weeks ago, I encouraged radio observatories like MeerKAT to search for radio emission from 3I/ATLAS,” said Prof. Avi Loeb. “In response, I was assured that 3I/ATLAS will be monitored.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of the hydroxyl absorption lines is notable as it aligns with theories about interstellar communication. The frequencies detected fall within the ranges that scientists have considered ideal for potential signals from intelligent civilizations since the 1970s. Previous coincidences, such as the arrival direction of 3I/ATLAS matching the 1977 Wow! Signal, have added to interest in this object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to determine if the hydroxyl production fluctuates or if the signal exhibits any non-thermal modulation, which could suggest engineering. The next significant observation is set for December 19, when Earth will be at its closest approach to the comet.</p>
