      <h2>NASA 3I/ATLAS comet update: ‘It’s a window into another solar system’</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, has drawn significant attention from space enthusiasts and scientists alike, following new images and information released by NASA on Wednesday. The comet, which entered the solar system from another galaxy, is currently being studied as it approaches Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it offers a unique opportunity to examine an object from outside our solar system. NASA is actively monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics, with various instruments and teams working together to gather data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, near Jupiter</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 167 million miles</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 2025, within 18 million miles</li>
    <li>Expected to pass Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, as it entered the solar system. It approached Mars in early October, coming within 18 million miles of the planet. By October 30, it reached its closest point to the sun. NASA anticipates the comet will be closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet. But this one came from outside the solar system, which makes it fascinating, exciting, and scientifically very important,” said NASA associate administrator Amit Kshatriya.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is circumstantial evidence, given how fast it has come into our solar system, that it came from some very old solar system around a very old star,” said Dr. Tom Statler, lead scientist for solar system small bodies at NASA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We love that the world wondered along with us,” said Dr. Nicky Fox, associate administrator with NASA Science.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is notable as it is the third interstellar object identified to have visited our solar system. Previous interstellar objects have provided insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems, enhancing our understanding of cosmic history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December, utilizing various instruments to gather more data on its composition and trajectory.</p>
