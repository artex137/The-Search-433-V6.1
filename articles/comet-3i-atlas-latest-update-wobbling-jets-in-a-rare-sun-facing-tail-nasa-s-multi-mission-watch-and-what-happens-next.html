      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Latest Update: Wobbling Jets in a Rare Sun-Facing Tail</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is currently moving through our solar system and is expected to reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet’s passage.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study material from beyond our solar system. Authorities, including NASA, are utilizing multiple missions to observe and analyze 3I/ATLAS as it makes its way out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first reported on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest to the Sun): October 30, 2025, at 1.4 AU (approximately 210 million km).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (approximately 270 million km).</li>
    <li>Observation campaign spanned 37 nights between July and September 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations reported a tail stretching up to 620,000 miles (about 1 million km).</li>
    <li>SETI Institute found no evidence of technosignatures from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025. Follow-up observations indicated that the comet is traveling on a hyperbolic path, meaning it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun.</p>

<p>From July to September 2025, scientists conducted an intensive observation campaign using the Two-meter Twin Telescope at Spain’s Teide Observatory. They reported unusual features, including a sun-facing anti-tail and jets that exhibit a periodic wobble.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the SETI Institute released its findings, confirming that there is no evidence of artificial signals from the comet, clarifying its identity as a natural astrophysical object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is an extraordinarily normal interstellar comet,” said a representative from the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, emphasizing the value of understanding normal comet physics in the context of this interstellar visitor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The most comprehensive ‘is it transmitting?’ question has been asked—and, so far, the answer is no,” stated the SETI Institute regarding their observations of the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Observations of interstellar comets provide unique insights into the formation of planetary systems around different stars.</p>

<p>The comet's anti-tail and wobbling jets present a valuable opportunity for researchers to compare the physical characteristics of interstellar comets with those formed within our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves outward from the solar system. The comet is expected to remain observable with small telescopes until spring 2026, depending on conditions and equipment. Further analysis of its behavior and characteristics will provide insights into cometary science.</p>
