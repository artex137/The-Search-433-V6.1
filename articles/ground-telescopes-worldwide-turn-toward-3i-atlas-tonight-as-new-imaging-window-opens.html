      <h2>Ground Telescopes Worldwide Turn Toward 3I/ATLAS Tonight As New Imaging Window Opens</h2>

<p>Tonight marks the reopening of observations for the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, as ground-based telescopes around the world prepare for the clearest views yet. Observatories are set to capture the object as it rises above the eastern horizon in the constellation Virgo, following its perihelion passage on October 30.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it allows both amateur and professional astronomers to collect uninterrupted data on 3I/ATLAS, which is only the third interstellar object confirmed to enter our solar system. The Virtual Telescope Project will livestream its observations starting at 11:15 p.m. ET from Manciano, Italy, providing the public with real-time views of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>It completed perihelion on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object has a magnitude of +10.9 and remains invisible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project will begin livestreaming at 11:15 p.m. ET on November 11, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, and was classified as an interstellar object based on its trajectory and speed. It completed perihelion on October 30, becoming temporarily obscured by the sun's glare. The first post-perihelion images were captured on November 11, revealing a brightened coma and a distinct ion tail.</p>

<p>As of now, the object is visible in the early morning hours, with telescopes positioned worldwide ready to track its movement. This marks the start of a crucial observation period leading up to its closest approach to Earth in 33 days.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Tonight marks the beginning of a collective effort to document 3I/ATLAS,” said astronomer Gianluca Masi, who captured the first post-perihelion image. “The data we gather will shape future scientific papers and enhance our understanding of interstellar visitors.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the interstellar objects ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which raised questions about their origins and behaviors. However, 3I/ATLAS exhibits more complex characteristics, including changes in tail direction and luminosity that challenge existing theories.</p>

<p>The current observation window offers a unique opportunity for scientists to gather detailed data that could influence future planetary defense protocols and improve our understanding of such celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As telescopes around the world begin to document 3I/ATLAS, ongoing observations will be critical. Researchers will analyze data related to the object's brightness, tail morphology, and other features leading up to its closest approach on December 19, 2023. The volume of images and data collected is expected to increase significantly during this period.</p>
