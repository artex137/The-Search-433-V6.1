      <h2>James Webb unveils comet 3I/ATLAS: 7 billion year old origin and extrasolar chemical composition</h2>

<p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has identified interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has origins dating back over 7 billion years, according to a report released on December 9, 2025. The comet, detected by the ATLAS network in Chile in July 2025, is currently traveling at approximately 26 kilometers per second and is on a trajectory that poses no risk to Earth, maintaining a distance of more than 240 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides scientists with rare opportunities to study materials from outside our solar system. The observations made by the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a chemical composition that diverges from typical solar system comets, offering insights into the conditions present in distant stellar environments.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected in July 2025 by ATLAS network in Chile.</li>
    <li>Current speed: approximately 26 km/s.</li>
    <li>Minimum distance from Earth: greater than 240 million km.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on October 30, 2025, at about 210 million km.</li>
    <li>Estimated age: over 7 billion years.</li>
    <li>Significant chemical composition: high levels of carbon dioxide detected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is detected by the ATLAS network in Chile.</p>
<p>October 30, 2025: The comet reaches perihelion, coming within approximately 210 million kilometers of the Sun.</p>
<p>End of November 2025: The comet's trajectory changes slightly, leading to discussions about its origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of gases common in comets, such as cyanide and other volatile organic molecules, confirms the icy nature of the object’s core,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Astrophysicists have ruled out the hypothesis of technological intervention for 3I/ATLAS, attributing the change in route to natural phenomena,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third comet of extrasolar origin confirmed by NASA, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Each of these discoveries has contributed to the understanding of interstellar dynamics and the formation of the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and researchers will continue to analyze data from comet 3I/ATLAS to gain further insights into cosmic evolution and the formation of planetary systems. The detailed study of this comet is expected to enhance understanding of the chemical diversity in the universe.</p>
