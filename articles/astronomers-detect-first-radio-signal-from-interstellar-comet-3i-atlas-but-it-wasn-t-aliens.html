      <h2>Astronomers detect first 'radio signal' from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS — but it wasn't aliens</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected the first radio signal from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, a finding that has sparked interest in the scientific community but has been confirmed not to originate from extraterrestrial life. The signal was detected using the Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope in New Mexico, according to the National Science Foundation (NSF) on Thursday, October 5, 2023.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first instance of a comet emitting a radio signal, which could provide insights into the composition and behavior of such celestial bodies. Researchers are analyzing the data to understand the comet's structure and the processes involved in its radio emissions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was initially discovered in 2019.</li>
    <li>The radio signal was detected on October 5, 2023.</li>
    <li>The detection was made using the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico.</li>
    <li>The National Science Foundation is involved in the research.</li>
    <li>No evidence of extraterrestrial life has been found.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in December 2019. It has since traveled through our solar system and is currently on its way back to interstellar space. The recent detection of the radio signal occurred on October 5, 2023, during observations at the VLA.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is an exciting discovery that gives us a new tool to study comets,” said an NSF spokesperson. “However, it is important to clarify that there is no indication of alien life.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of radio signals from comets is rare and has only been reported in a few instances. Previous studies of comets have primarily focused on their visual and infrared emissions. The findings from 3I/ATLAS may lead to new methods of studying other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from the VLA to gain further insights into the comet's characteristics and behavior. Future observations may provide additional information on the comet's activity as it moves through the solar system.</p>
