      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-07 01:47 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Lights Up the Solar System</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has become the focus of attention as it approaches its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and independent astronomers have released new images and analyses, showcasing the comet’s jets, dual tails, and a puzzling brightness pattern.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. As the comet nears Earth, scientists are using multiple missions to gather data and improve understanding of its unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> Approximately 1.8 astronomical units (≈270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 58 km/s (over 210,000 km/h)</li>
    <li><strong>Previous closest approaches:</strong> Sun on October 29, Mars on October 3, Venus on November 3</li>
    <li><strong>Current brightness:</strong> Approximately magnitude 11–12</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first reported by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025, and initially catalogued as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS). The comet followed a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it is not bound to the Sun and will not return once it leaves.</p>

<p>In October and November 2025, the comet made close passes by the Sun, Mars, and Venus, with significant observations made by various space missions. On November 30, Hubble Space Telescope captured new images while 3I/ATLAS was approximately 286 million km from Earth.</p>

<p>ESA's Juice spacecraft also observed the comet in early November as it approached the Sun, providing additional data on its activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The luminous teardrop-like coma has a radius of order tens of thousands of kilometres,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, noting the unique features of 3I/ATLAS based on new Hubble data.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The goal of this and earlier July observations is to track how the comet’s activity evolves as it swings around the Sun,” NASA stated regarding their ongoing research efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a rare class of celestial objects, being only the third confirmed interstellar comet observed in the Solar System. Its peculiar behavior and characteristics, including a sunward “anti-tail,” challenge conventional understanding of comet dynamics.</p>

<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov provided insight into interstellar objects, but 3I/ATLAS presents a new opportunity to study how such bodies interact with the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth. Further data from the Juice spacecraft is expected to arrive by February 2026, providing more insights into the comet’s composition and behavior.</p>
