      <h2>3I/ATLAS ‘most likely natural,’ Harvard professor concedes</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has stated that Comet 3I/ATLAS is “most likely natural.” This announcement was made during an interview on December 19, 2025. Loeb's previous claims suggested that the comet, which passed through the solar system in 2020, could have been an artificial object.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it shifts the scientific community's understanding of the comet's origins. The comet's trajectory and characteristics sparked debates among astronomers about its nature. Following Loeb's latest remarks, researchers are expected to reassess their analyses of 3I/ATLAS and its implications for future astronomical studies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a professor of astrophysics at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was observed in 2020 as it passed through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Loeb's initial claims suggested the comet might be artificial.</li>
    <li>The recent statement was made during an interview on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2020, Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected as it approached the inner solar system. Its unusual characteristics led to speculation about its origins. In subsequent years, Avi Loeb publicly suggested the possibility of an artificial origin, igniting widespread interest and debate in the scientific community.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, Loeb re-evaluated his stance during an interview, conceding that the comet is likely a natural formation, aligning with more conventional scientific views.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “After careful consideration, I believe 3I/ATLAS is most likely a natural comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding Comet 3I/ATLAS has been ongoing since its discovery. Initial hypotheses about its artificial nature challenged traditional views on cometary phenomena. Loeb's previous assertions had sparked both interest and skepticism among astronomers and the general public.</p>

<p>Loeb's latest admission may help to restore focus on more conventional astronomical research and reduce sensationalist narratives surrounding unidentified celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following Loeb's revised position, researchers are likely to conduct further studies on 3I/ATLAS. This may include detailed analysis of its composition and trajectory, as well as a review of existing data to better understand similar celestial bodies in the future.</p>
