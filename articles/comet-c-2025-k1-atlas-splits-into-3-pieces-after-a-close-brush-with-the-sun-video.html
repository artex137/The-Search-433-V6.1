      <h2>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) Splits into Three Pieces After Close Approach to the Sun</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has broken into three distinct pieces following its closest approach to the sun on October 8, 2025. Astronomers have captured footage of the fragmentation that occurred on the nights of November 11 and 12.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it demonstrates the effects of solar proximity on cometary bodies. Researchers from the Asiago Observatory in Italy have been closely monitoring the comet's behavior since its discovery in May 2025. The fragmentation provides valuable data regarding the composition of ancient comets and the processes that govern their integrity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) approached the sun on October 8, 2025.</li>
    <li>Fragmentation observed on November 11 and 12, 2025.</li>
    <li>Two primary pieces are approximately 2,000 km apart, according to research astronomer Mazzotta Epifani.</li>
    <li>A third, smaller fragment has also been detected.</li>
    <li>The observations were made using the 1.82 m Copernicus telescope at the Asiago Observatory.</li>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) originated from the Kuiper belt.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 8, 2025, Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) made its closest approach to the sun. The heat from the sun destabilized the comet's structure, leading to its fragmentation. Astronomers recorded the comet breaking apart on November 11, with further observations continuing into November 12.</p>

<p>During this time, astronomer Gianluca Masi from the Virtual Telescope Project captured additional images of the fragmentation, noting the development of fragments over a 24-hour period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “From a first quick analysis of the images, we can confirm that there are definitely two fairly similar pieces, whose maximum brightness is separated by about 2,000 km,” said research astronomer Mazzotta Epifani.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The animation shows how fragments appeared after the break-up of the original nucleus of C/2025 K1 evolved in 24 hours,” said Gianluca Masi.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is believed to have originated in the Kuiper belt and may have disintegrated during its first journey into the inner solar system. This fragmentation provides insight into the primordial materials that formed the planets. The comet is distinct from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has gained attention for its unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the fragments of Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) to gain further insights into its composition and the dynamics of cometary bodies. Observations will likely continue as the comet moves through the solar system.</p>
