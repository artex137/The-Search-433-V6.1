      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet's Near Miss Prompts Putin's Rare Space Comment on 'Secret Weapon'</h2>

<p>On 19 December 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the media during his annual news conference, where he responded to a question about the comet 3I/ATLAS. Putin, while jokingly referring to the comet as a "secret weapon," confirmed that Russian scientists are monitoring the object and stated it poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This event has drawn attention to both the comet's unusual characteristics and the potential for misinformation surrounding it. Authorities, including astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have expressed concern over the rise of AI-generated misinformation related to 3I/ATLAS, particularly on social media platforms.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: 19 December 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Russia, during Putin's annual news conference</li>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS is travelling at 60 kilometres per second</li>
    <li>Distance from Jupiter: 53.6 million kilometres on 16 March 2026</li>
    <li>Notable feature: An anti-tail stretching nearly a million kilometres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 19 December 2025, during a press conference, a journalist asked President Putin if 3I/ATLAS was an alien spacecraft or a foreign threat. Putin responded with a humorous remark about it being a "secret weapon" before clarifying that it is a comet from another star.</p>
<p>Following this, astrophysicist Avi Loeb highlighted the issue of AI-generated misinformation surrounding the comet, noting the prevalence of unverified images on social media.</p>
<p>Amateur astronomers captured images of 3I/ATLAS on the same day, revealing an anti-tail that has intrigued scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It must remain exclusively between us. It's our secret weapon,”</blockquote>
<p>- Vladimir Putin, during the press conference.</p>
<blockquote>“Artificial fakery is the greatest upcoming nemesis of science,”</blockquote>
<p>- Avi Loeb, addressing concerns about misinformation.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet unlike any previous visitors to Earth, having travelled for billions of years. Its trajectory and characteristics are still being studied, particularly its anti-tail, which poses questions about its composition.</p>
<p>The comet is set to make a close approach to Jupiter in March 2026, which will provide further opportunities for observation and analysis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct spectroscopic and imaging studies of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter on 16 March 2026. NASA's Juno spacecraft will monitor the comet's behaviour near Jupiter's Lagrange points to gain insights into its mysterious properties.</p>
