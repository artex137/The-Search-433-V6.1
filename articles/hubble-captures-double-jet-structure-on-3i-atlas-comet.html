      <h2>Hubble captures double-jet structure on 3I/ATLAS comet</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured images of the comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a double-jet structure during its perihelion on October 29, 2025. The comet was deflected by the Sun’s gravity by 16 degrees, which has altered its jet activity.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may indicate changes in the comet's behavior post-perihelion compared to its activity before. Researchers are currently analyzing Hubble's data to understand the nature of the two jets and what they reveal about the comet's composition and motion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Deflection by Sun's gravity: 16 degrees</li>
    <li>Hubble observations: December 12 and December 27, 2025</li>
    <li>Image exposure time: 170 seconds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, during which it was deflected by the Sun’s gravity. Following this, Hubble captured images of the comet on December 12 and December 27, 2025. During these observations, researchers noted the emergence of a double-jet structure, which displays variability in brightness and shape.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The two jets may indicate a change in the comet's activity post-perihelion,” said a member of the research team. “We are working to analyze the latest data to understand these dynamics.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of comets can change significantly as they approach the Sun. This phenomenon is not uncommon, as heating from solar radiation can activate jets of gas and dust. Observations of 3I/ATLAS contribute to the broader understanding of comet dynamics and their interaction with solar forces.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the Hubble data to measure the potential evolution of 3I/ATLAS and to confirm the origin of its jets. Future observations may provide further insights into the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>
