      <h2>Perihelion Asymmetry In The Water Production Rate Of The Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, has shown significant water production rates as observed through space-based measurements, according to research accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. The findings come from observations taken between November and December 2025, as the object approached its perihelion, a point in its orbit closest to the Sun.</p>

<p>This research is crucial as it provides insights into the composition and origin of 3I/ATLAS. The study reveals a peak post-perihelion water production rate, which suggests that the object’s water output is influenced by solar insolation. The results will help scientists better understand the behavior of interstellar objects and their features.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation Period: November to December 2025</li>
    <li>Peak Water Production Rate: QH<sub>2</sub>O ≈ 4 × 10<sup>28</sup> mol s<sup>−1</sup></li>
    <li>Minimum Active Fraction: ∼30% (assuming a maximum nucleus radius of 2.8 km)</li>
    <li>Research Institutions: Planetary Environmental and Astrobiological Research Laboratory (PEARL), Sun Yat-sen University, National Research Council, Institute of Applied Physics “Nello Carrara”</li>
    <li>Publication: Accepted for The Astrophysical Journal Letters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been monitored using SOHO/SWAN Lyman-α observations as it neared perihelion. During this time, the team conducted 3D Monte Carlo modeling to analyze the water production rates of the object.</p>

<p>The study reports a significant post-perihelion water production rate, which was shown to vary with solar exposure. The findings highlight an asymmetrical water production pattern, indicating different scaling behaviors during the inbound and outbound phases of its orbit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The post-perihelion behavior indicates that the water production of 3I/ATLAS was driven primarily by the varying solar insolation acting on a stable active area,” said Hanjie Tan, one of the researchers involved in the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This research builds on prior studies of interstellar objects, particularly focusing on their water production mechanisms. The findings align with observations of other comets, such as 103P/Hartley 2, suggesting that icy grains may be a common source of water in these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it progresses through its orbit. Future observations may provide further insights into the long-term behavior and composition of this interstellar object.</p>
