      <h2>Unpublished data marks the farewell of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from our solar system</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has begun its journey away from the Solar System after its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers. This event concludes a period of intense observation that has provided valuable insights into the composition and behavior of objects from other stars.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the unprecedented data collected during its passage, which will be analyzed for years to come. Authorities and scientists have mobilized globally to study the comet, which was first identified on July 1, 2025, as the third interstellar visitor detected, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Initial detection: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated speed: over 200,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Comet diameter: between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Detection by: ATLAS telescope system, funded by NASA</li>
    <li>Future trajectory: passing through the orbits of Jupiter in 2026 and Saturn in 2028</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system. Following its identification, a global alert was issued to the scientific community, allowing for coordinated monitoring. By October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, during which it exhibited classic cometary behavior, forming a coma and tail due to warming. After its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, the comet has continued on its hyperbolic trajectory, moving away from the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS has provided a unique opportunity to study interstellar objects and their characteristics,” said a spokesperson for the ATLAS project. “The data collected will enhance our understanding of the formation of planetary systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the detection of two previous interstellar visitors, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. While 'Oumuamua exhibited no visible cometary activity, 2I/Borisov was an active comet rich in carbon monoxide. The behavior of 3I/ATLAS, characterized by stable cometary activity and a rich organic composition, indicates a diverse range of bodies traveling through the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected during the passage of 3I/ATLAS. This research aims to uncover new insights about the origins of planets and the distribution of organic matter in the Milky Way. Future studies will also enhance strategies for detecting and studying other interstellar objects.</p>
