      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could disintegrate as it approaches the Sun, astronomers warn</h2>

<p>Astronomers are closely monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, with concerns it may disintegrate during its perihelion in early 2026. Discovered in 2023, the comet is showing signs of instability, including fluctuations in brightness that suggest its core may be breaking apart.</p>

<p>This situation is significant as it provides a unique opportunity to study the composition of an interstellar body, according to scientists. Continuous observation from ground and space observatories aims to capture the moment of potential disintegration, which could create a brief meteor shower, although it poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object observed, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, is scheduled for early 2026.</li>
    <li>Observatories in Chile, Hawaii, and space are monitoring the comet continuously.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified by telescopes from the ATLAS program, which is designed to detect potentially hazardous asteroids. Since its discovery, astronomers have noted an increase in brightness followed by a decrease, indicating potential fragmentation.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches the Sun, it experiences sublimation due to increased solar radiation, which can lead to violent and uneven activity in its fragile nucleus. Recent observations suggest that the comet may be on the verge of disintegration, with predictions that it could break apart before reaching perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behavior we are observing is a classic omen of imminent collapse,” an astronomer noted, highlighting the risks associated with the comet's approach.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, interstellar objects have been rare sightings in our solar system. The discovery of ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov has raised interest in the study of such bodies, indicating that they may cross our solar neighborhood more frequently than previously thought.</p>
<p>The ATLAS program, funded by NASA, has proven to be an effective tool for planetary defense and scientific research, allowing for the detection of fast-moving celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>A global network of observatories will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS to track its evolution. Scientists aim to create a detailed model of its possible fragmentation to enhance understanding of cometary structures and origins.</p>
