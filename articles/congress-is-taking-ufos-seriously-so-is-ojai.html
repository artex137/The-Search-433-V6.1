      <h2>Congress is taking UFOs seriously — So is Ojai</h2>

<p>Congress has held a hearing on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) on September 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C., where several witnesses testified. The hearing follows a significant video release showing a U.S. military drone encountering a UFO, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This hearing is part of an ongoing effort to increase transparency regarding UFOs and to restore public trust. It marks the third Congressional hearing on the topic since July 2023. Authorities are now focusing on the implications of the testimonies and evidence presented, including claims of UFO incursions over military bases.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Key witnesses: Navy Chief Alexandro Wiggins, U.S. Army veterans Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Dylan Borland, investigative journalist George Knapp</li>
    <li>Video evidence: Military drone footage from October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Events reported: UFOs over Langley Air Force Base, Vandenberg Air Force Base incursions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a U.S. military MQ-9 drone filmed an unidentified flying object being struck by a Hellfire missile, which reportedly did not impact the object and led to the emergence of three additional orbs.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2025, witnesses, including military veterans and journalists, testified before Congress, revealing various incidents involving UFOs and military installations.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer of 2023, Congress has been actively investigating UFO sightings and related military encounters, leading up to this latest hearing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The question is no longer whether these events are real, but whether we have the courage to face them,” said Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) during the hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>George Knapp, a longtime investigative journalist, recounted an incident in 1982 where an unknown craft allegedly activated nuclear warheads, stating it brought the world “a couple of seconds away from World War III.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this hearing, numerous military personnel have reported encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena. Congress has increased its scrutiny of these incidents, reflecting growing public interest and demand for transparency.</p>
<p>The Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets has been central to these efforts, aiming to gather and disclose information related to UFOs and military encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims presented at the hearing are expected to continue, with potential for further hearings and disclosures as Congress seeks to clarify the implications of these findings.</p>
