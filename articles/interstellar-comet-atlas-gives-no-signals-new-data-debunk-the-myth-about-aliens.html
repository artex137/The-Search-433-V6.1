      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS gives no signals: new data debunk the myth about aliens</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has not shown any signs of alien technology, according to recent studies published by scientists who conducted radio observations at the Green Bank telescope. The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has been the subject of speculation regarding the existence of advanced civilizations beyond the Solar System.</p>

<p>These findings are significant as they address widespread rumors about the potential presence of technosignatures on 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including researchers involved in the Breakthrough Listen program, have stated that the search for evidence of advanced civilizations will continue, despite the current lack of findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Observations conducted at Green Bank telescope</li>
    <li>Search involved 471,000 potential signals</li>
    <li>Only nine events detected, all identified as noise</li>
    <li>Findings indicate no technosignatures detected</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, scientists began extensive observations of the comet using various telescopes.</p>
<p>In the six months after its discovery, researchers analyzed data from the Green Bank telescope under the Breakthrough Listen program. The study concluded with no evidence of technosignatures.</p>
<p>Researchers reported their findings recently, and they continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS along with other interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our study concludes that there are no isotropic continuous wave transmitters greater than 0.1 watts at the location of 3I/ATLAS. In comparison, a mobile phone is approximately an isotropic continuous wave transmitter of about 1 watt,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in the Solar System, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet has previously exhibited cryovolcanism, with eruptions of ice and dust observed as it neared the Sun. Its characteristics suggest similarities to trans-Neptunian objects and primitive chondrite meteorites.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community will continue to collect data on 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects. Researchers remain hopeful for future discoveries, although the likelihood of detecting technosignatures from this comet appears low.</p>
