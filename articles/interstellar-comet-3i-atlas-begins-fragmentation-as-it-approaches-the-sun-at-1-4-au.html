      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS begins fragmentation as it approaches the Sun at 1.4 AU</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025, has shown the first signs of fragmentation as it approaches perihelion at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun on October 30, 2025. The comet, originating from outside the Solar System, is currently about 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</p>

<p>This fragmentation is significant as it provides valuable insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Astronomers from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are monitoring the event in real time, gathering data that could enhance understanding of cometary dynamics and the origins of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 1.4 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's core is estimated to be less than 1 kilometer in size.</li>
    <li>It follows a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>Fragmentation signs began on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Hubble and James Webb Telescopes are capturing emissions in real time.</li>
    <li>Current speed exceeds 60 km/s, preventing gravitational capture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. As it travels through the Solar System, it has reached a distance of 1.4 AU from the Sun as of October 30, 2025. The comet has been monitored closely by NASA and ESA, with fragmentation detected due to increasing solar heat.</p>
<p>The comet's trajectory confirms it will pass through the Solar System only once, with no return expected. Observations indicate that its core may face complete rupture within hours due to heat-induced sublimation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The increase in temperature accelerates sublimation, with the potential for complete core rupture within the next few hours,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Spectroscopic analysis has revealed rare organic molecules in its nucleus, which may provide insights into planetary processes in other stellar systems. Similar outbursts observed in 2I/Borisov indicate that fragmentation can produce smaller fragments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. Data collection will focus on the comet's chemical composition and behavior during the fragmentation process, with expectations of a significant loss in mass post-perihelion.</p>
