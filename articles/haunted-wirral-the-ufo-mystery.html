      <h2>Haunted Wirral – The UFO Mystery</h2>

<p>Reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over Wirral have surged in recent weeks, according to psychic researcher Tom Slemen, who has documented these sightings in his column for the Globe. Several witnesses have described unusual lights and craft in the skies, particularly along Lever Causeway, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>The increase in UFO sightings has prompted local interest and speculation. Slemen has asserted that many of these reports cannot be attributed to common astronomical objects or aircraft. Authorities have not confirmed any investigations into these incidents as of yet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reports of UFOs have surged in Wirral recently.</li>
    <li>Notable sightings occurred on January 1, 2026, and January 3, 2026.</li>
    <li>Witnesses have described bright lights and a circular craft about 15 metres in diameter.</li>
    <li>Lever Causeway has been identified as a frequent location for sightings.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these sightings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 1, 2026, at approximately 2 a.m., three bright lights were reported travelling along Lever Causeway at about 48 km/h. Witnesses noted that these lights separated at the Mount Road junction.</p>

<p>Later that morning, around 4 a.m., three white lights were seen hovering over Victoria Park. Both sightings are part of a pattern of reports from the Lever Causeway area.</p>

<p>On January 3, 2026, at about 1:30 p.m., a silvery globe was observed flying silently about 30 metres above the ground in Moreton. It travelled parallel to Pasture Road before disappearing over the Tarran Industrial Estate.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I do not believe these reports are misidentifications of Venus, Jupiter, aircraft lights or drones,” Tom Slemen stated, emphasizing the uniqueness of these sightings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to these recent sightings, Lever Causeway has been a focal point for UFO reports, including a notable incident last summer involving a couple who encountered a circular craft. This area appears to have a history of unusual aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>In the past, similar reports have surfaced in various parts of the UK, often without clear explanations or follow-up investigations from local authorities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into these UFO sightings have not been announced, and it remains unclear if local authorities will take action or issue further statements regarding the phenomenon. Witnesses are encouraged to report any additional sightings as they occur.</p>
