      <h2>3I/ATLAS turns green, indicating more outbursts could happen as it zooms towards Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has turned green as it approaches Earth, with its closest distance expected on December 19. The comet is currently in an active phase and has shown significant changes since its discovery in July. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to its passage.</p>

<p>This event is significant as scientists anticipate more outbursts from 3I/ATLAS due to the delayed effects of solar heat. NOIRLab, which operates the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii, has noted the comet's unusual color change, linking it to the gases it is emitting. Observations continue as astronomers monitor its approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach a distance of about <strong>270.5 million kilometres</strong> from Earth on <strong>December 19</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet was first spotted in <strong>July 2023</strong>.</li>
    <li>It exhibited a green color change observed by the Gemini North telescope on <strong>November 26</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently in an extremely active phase after its perihelion in late October.</li>
    <li>The comet continues to show an anti-tail, a phenomenon still under investigation by scientists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 21, 2023, when the Hubble Space Telescope detected its initial trajectory. On October 31, the comet reached perihelion, leading to significant sublimation of ice and dust. On November 26, the Gemini North telescope captured images showing the comet's green hue, indicating a change in its chemical composition as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Many comets have a delayed reaction in experiencing the Sun's heat due to the lag in time that it takes for heat to make its way through the interior of the comet. A delay can activate the evaporation of new chemicals or trigger a comet outburst,” said representatives from NOIRLab.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The color change of 3I/ATLAS is notable as it has transitioned from appearing red during earlier observations in August to its current green state. This phenomenon has been previously observed in other comets, such as 12P/Pons-Brooks and C/2025 F2 (SWAN). The unusual anti-tail observed in 3I/ATLAS has also sparked interest among scientists, as they continue to explore the processes behind it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its activity and observe for potential outbursts. Further observations are planned to better understand the comet's behavior and the implications of its changing composition.</p>
