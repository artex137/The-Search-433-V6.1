      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Could Be Key to Solving Planet Formation Mysteries</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered a fast-moving interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, on July 1, 2025. The comet is traveling nearly twice as fast as previous interstellar visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. Its nucleus is estimated to be about 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) in diameter, making it significantly larger than its predecessors.</p>

<p>This discovery has sparked considerable interest among scientists due to the potential origins of 3I/ATLAS, which may differ from bodies within our Solar System. Professor Susanne Pfalzner from Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany presented hypotheses regarding interstellar comets during the Joint Meeting of the Europlanet Science Congress and the American Astronomical Society’s Division for Planetary Science (EPSC-DPS2025). Pfalzner and co-author Michele Bannister explored the idea that interstellar comets could serve as "planet seeds," potentially addressing long-standing mysteries surrounding planet formation.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers confirmed the discovery of comet 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third confirmed interstellar visitor. Following the discovery, Professor Pfalzner presented her findings at the EPSC-DPS2025, where she discussed the implications of interstellar comets on planet formation.</p>

<p>Pfalzner and Bannister highlighted the limitations of traditional planet formation models, which suggest planets emerge from protoplanetary disks. They proposed that interstellar comets could act as catalysts in the formation process, particularly around high-mass stars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“A small object smashing into a larger seed would not disintegrate as easily,” Pfalzner explained, emphasizing the efficiency of the proposed mechanism for planet formation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Traditional models of planet formation face challenges in explaining the emergence of massive planets that appear too young based on their observed features. The research by Pfalzner and Bannister suggests that interstellar objects may play a crucial role in overcoming these barriers, particularly in systems with high-mass stars.</p>

<p>This research raises questions about the rarity of gas giants around smaller stars, such as M-dwarfs, and the implications of incorporating interstellar seeds into future planetary formation models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As research continues, scientists aim to further investigate the role of interstellar objects in planet formation. These findings could significantly alter our understanding of the origins and dynamics of planets within our galaxy and beyond.</p>
