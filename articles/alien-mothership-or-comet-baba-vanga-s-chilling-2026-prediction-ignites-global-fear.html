      <h2>Alien Mothership or Comet? 3I/ATLAS Sparks Global Fear</h2>

<p>A mysterious celestial object, named 3I/ATLAS, has sparked global concern as it travels through the solar system, having been detected on 1 July 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. The object moves at over 210,000 kilometres per hour and has raised questions about its origins and potential implications for humanity.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as astronomers and mystics alike have linked 3I/ATLAS to predictions made by the Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga regarding a colossal spacecraft arriving in 2026. While space agencies maintain that the object is a comet, the unusual features of 3I/ATLAS have led to discussions about its nature and what it may mean for the future of human understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object detected on 1 July 2025 by ATLAS survey in Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at over 210,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>It is only the third known interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
    <li>Hubble images show mini-jets arranged at 120-degree intervals.</li>
    <li>Predicted close approach in early 2026 coincides with Baba Vanga's prophecy.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency classify it as an icy comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers at the ATLAS survey in Chile discovered 3I/ATLAS. The object has since been observed as it travels through the solar system, skimming past planets including Jupiter, Mars, and Venus. As its trajectory has become clearer, discussions have intensified regarding its classification and potential implications.</p>

<p>In late 2025, the connection between 3I/ATLAS and Baba Vanga's prophecy has been noted, with many interpreting her warnings as a reference to this object. The timeline of the object's approach aligns with Vanga's predictions, leading to heightened speculation about its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While most astronomers remain cautious, anomalies in the object's behaviour have sparked heated debates about its origin," said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is an icy comet with a dust-filled coma,” stated a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, two other interstellar objects, 'Oumuamua and Borisov, were detected, raising interest in celestial visitors from outside our solar system. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its unusual anti-tail, have led to theories about its potential artificial origin.</p>

<p>Baba Vanga's prophecies have gained notoriety over the years, with followers interpreting her predictions as warnings of significant global events. The alignment of her forecast with the arrival of 3I/ATLAS has provoked both fear and curiosity among the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will maintain close observation of its trajectory. The implications of its characteristics and any potential link to Vanga's prophecy will likely remain a topic of discussion among scientists, mystics, and the general public as the predicted close approach in early 2026 approaches.</p>
