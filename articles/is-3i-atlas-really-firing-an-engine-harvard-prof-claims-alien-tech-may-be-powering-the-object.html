      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS Really Firing an Engine? Harvard Prof Claims Alien Tech May Be Powering the Object</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through our solar system, may be exhibiting signs of propulsion that cannot be explained by gravity alone. The object, discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, is set to reach its closest point to Earth in late December 2023, approximately 170 million miles away.</p>

<p>Loeb's observations raise questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, challenging the conventional understanding of comets. He has noted anomalies that suggest the object may be propelled by an unseen force, which could indicate the presence of advanced technology. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, but the discussion has sparked public interest in space exploration.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered by:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> Late December 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Projected exit from solar system:</strong> January 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Key researcher:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. As it travels through the solar system, observations have indicated that it is accelerating in a manner inconsistent with gravitational forces. Loeb has recorded multiple anomalies over recent weeks, including the object's lack of a comet tail and its unusual colour, which he speculates could indicate artificial light or ionised carbon monoxide.</p>

<p>On 2 October 2023, NASA captured images of 3I/ATLAS using the HiRise camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Loeb has urged NASA to release these high-resolution images to better understand the object before it exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When you have a visitor to your backyard, you better know its nature,” Loeb stated. “We can't afford to just adopt the most likely interpretation, which is that it's a natural object.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed in our solar system. Previous objects have also raised questions about their origins and characteristics. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretations of these anomalies, with some sceptics questioning the more sensational claims made by researchers like Loeb.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The release of high-resolution images is anticipated, which may provide further insight into the object's composition and behaviour. The scientific community will likely analyze these findings to determine the nature of 3I/ATLAS before it leaves our solar system in January 2024.</p>
