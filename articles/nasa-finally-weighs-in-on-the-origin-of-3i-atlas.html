      <h2>NASA Finally Weighs In on the Origin of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object, following a series of observations from various missions. The panel of scientists presented these findings during a broadcast on October 26, 2023.</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it enhances the understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. NASA has stated that all observational data will be made publicly available for further investigation by researchers and the public alike.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 26, 2023</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 358 million km from the sun</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Safe distance during flyby: about 267 million km</li>
    <li>Data obtained from multiple NASA missions including MRO, MAVEN, SOHO, Psyche, and Lucy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's observations of 3I/ATLAS have spanned several months, with key imaging occurring as the comet approached the inner solar system. Notable images include those captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in October when the comet was approximately 29 million km away, showcasing its dust cloud.</p>
<p>In addition, the SOHO solar probe provided images of the comet between October 15 and 26, revealing its visibility from a distance of 358 million km.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This image was a surprise. We did not expect that the object could be seen from so far away,” said a NASA spokesperson regarding the SOHO images.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The interstellar object was revealed as a bright orb against a noisy background,” noted scientists discussing the STEREO observatory’s findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed by scientists, following 1I/2017 U1 and 2I/Borisov. The study of these objects provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies plan to initiate additional observing campaigns to capture further data and images of 3I/ATLAS leading up to its closest approach to Earth in December 2025.</p>
