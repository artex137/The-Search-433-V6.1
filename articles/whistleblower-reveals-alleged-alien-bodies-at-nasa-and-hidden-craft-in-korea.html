      <h2>Whistleblower Reveals Alleged Alien Bodies at NASA and Hidden Craft in Korea</h2>

<p>A former whistleblower has claimed that he saw six small humanoid bodies at NASA's Goddard Space Centre and that a massive extraterrestrial craft is hidden in Korea. The allegations, made recently, have reignited global speculation about UFOs and government secrecy.</p>

<p>The whistleblower’s account raises significant questions about the extent of government knowledge regarding extraterrestrial life. Authorities have not yet responded to these claims, but the revelations align with ongoing debates about UFOs and transparency in government operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Whistleblower claims to have seen six humanoid bodies at NASA's Goddard Space Centre.</li>
    <li>Incident reportedly occurred roughly fifty years ago, escorted by Wernher von Braun.</li>
    <li>Bodies were stored in a refrigerated room three floors below ground.</li>
    <li>Whistleblower states that the craft is hidden in South Korea, not North Korea.</li>
    <li>Claims suggest that the craft is too large to be moved covertly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to the whistleblower, he was escorted to a secure facility at NASA by Wernher von Braun approximately fifty years ago. He described entering a cold room where six humanoid bodies were stored in glass coffins. The encounter has remained vivid in his memory.</p>

<p>The whistleblower later clarified that while Area 51 is known for reverse-engineering technology from UFO wreckage, it is not a storage site for alien remains. He emphasized that his experience at Goddard Space Centre contradicts common assumptions about alien storage locations.</p>

<p>Recently, he has made claims about a massive craft hidden in South Korea, correcting an earlier assertion regarding its location in North Korea. He stated that logistical challenges make the covert transport of the craft nearly impossible.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They were clearly not from this Earth. Small, pale, almost fragile, and badly injured. I was instructed to wear a heavy insulated coat before entering, and the room was icy cold. I saw them with my own eyes.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Obama has confirmed aliens exist, but he also said he saw no evidence of them being stored at secret bases like Area 51.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This whistleblower's claims come amid a growing interest in UFOs and government transparency. Recent official confirmations of unexplained aerial phenomena have prompted increased public scrutiny of government operations related to UFOs. Previous incidents of alleged cover-ups have fueled speculation about the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not announced any investigations or actions in response to the whistleblower's claims. The situation remains fluid as public interest in UFOs continues to rise, and further developments may emerge in the coming weeks.</p>
