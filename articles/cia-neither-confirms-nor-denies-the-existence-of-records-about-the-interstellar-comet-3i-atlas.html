      <h2>CIA neither confirms nor denies the existence of records about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has responded to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, stating it cannot confirm or deny the existence of related records. The response, dated December 31, 2025, was sent to researcher John Greenewald Jr. The CIA's use of the Glomar response raises questions about the agency's handling of information related to the comet.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it contrasts with NASA's public classification of 3I/ATLAS as a natural celestial body, raising concerns in the scientific community about transparency and communication between government agencies. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no risk to Earth and has provided detailed observations of its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
  <li>The comet passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a safe distance.</li>
  <li>NASA classified 3I/ATLAS as a natural body during a press conference on November 19, 2025.</li>
  <li>The CIA's FOIA response was issued on December 31, 2025, following a request made in November 2025.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS has a speed exceeding 68 km/s relative to the solar system.</li>
  <li>Observations show 3I/ATLAS exhibiting a prominent anti-tail structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, when astronomers identified it as an object on a hyperbolic trajectory. Following this, NASA confirmed its interstellar origin with calculations indicating its high speed. The comet passed perihelion in October 2025, at approximately 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun, and continued to be monitored as it moved away from the solar system.</p>

<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA held a press conference where officials stated that 3I/ATLAS is of natural origin and that no evidence supports claims of artificial technology. The CIA received a FOIA request from John Greenewald Jr. in November 2025, seeking records related to the comet. The CIA issued its response on December 31, 2025, invoking national security exceptions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “3I/ATLAS is definitely of natural origin, based on data collected by multiple missions,” NASA officials said during the press conference on November 19, 2025.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  “The CIA’s response raises questions about why they would classify information on an object declared natural by NASA,” said Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist from Harvard University.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its discovery has prompted significant interest in the scientific community, particularly regarding its unusual characteristics compared to other comets. NASA's classification as a natural body contrasts with the CIA's non-disclosure stance, leading to discussions about the implications for transparency in government scientific communications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>John Greenewald Jr. has 90 days to appeal the CIA's decision regarding the FOIA request. Ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue as international organizations monitor its retreat into deep space, contributing to the understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
