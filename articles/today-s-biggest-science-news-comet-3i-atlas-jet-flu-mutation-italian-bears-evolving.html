      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Exhibits Wobbling Jet, Approaches Closest Point to Earth</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected a "wobbling high-latitude jet" in comet 3I/ATLAS, according to a preprint paper released on arXiv. The findings were reported on December 19, 2025, as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth this week. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first time scientists have observed a spinning jet on an interstellar comet. Researchers from the Teide Observatory in the Canary Islands made the observations, which suggest that the comet's nucleus is rapidly rotating as it travels through space. The findings have been accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The observations were made at the Teide Observatory in the Canary Islands.</li>
    <li>The preprint paper detailing the findings has been accepted for publication.</li>
    <li>Images from the European Space Agency show high-energy X-ray emissions surrounding the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently about 175 million miles (282 million km) from Earth.</li>
    <li>Observatories worldwide are monitoring the comet in collaboration with the U.N.'s International Asteroid Warning Network.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2025, astronomers reported detecting a wobbling jet in comet 3I/ATLAS. The observations were made from the Teide Observatory, and the findings have been accepted for publication in a scientific journal. Images from the European Space Agency revealed high-energy X-ray emissions around the comet, indicating the interaction of solar radiation with the comet's coma.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches Earth, various science agencies and observatories are coordinating efforts to monitor its trajectory and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This is the first time we have detected a spinning jet on an interstellar comet," said a spokesperson from the Teide Observatory.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of the few interstellar comets observed since the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. The study of such comets provides valuable insights into the composition and behavior of celestial objects from outside our solar system. The detection of jets and emissions can also enhance our understanding of the processes occurring as these comets approach the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its activity and gather data from various observatories. Researchers aim to release further findings and images in the coming days.</p>
