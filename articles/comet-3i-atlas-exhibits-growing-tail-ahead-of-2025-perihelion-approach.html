      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Exhibits Growing Tail Ahead of 2025 Perihelion Approach</h2>

<p>Recent observations have revealed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is developing a notable tail as it approaches its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, expected around October 29, 2025. The observations were made using the Gemini South telescope, operated by NOIRLab.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers, who are eager to understand the comet's behavior and characteristics. According to Karen Meech, an astronomer from the University of Hawai'i, the findings could provide insights into the composition and size of the dust particles in the comet's coma, as well as its chemical makeup.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is nearing perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations were made using the Gemini South telescope by NOIRLab.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma has expanded beyond Jupiter's orbit.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is notable for its high concentration of carbon dioxide ice.</li>
    <li>The tail is expected to consist of dust and gas particles ionized by solar wind.</li>
    <li>Earth's closest encounter with the comet will occur after perihelion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent observations of 3I/ATLAS have shown the comet's tail growing in size. The comet began its approach to perihelion, prompting astronomers to utilize the Gemini South telescope for detailed imaging. These images have provided a stationary view of the comet while background stars appear as streaks, highlighting the comet's movement.</p>

<p>The observations focus on the colors of the comet, which offer clues to its composition. The analysis of these findings is ongoing, with researchers noting the unique behavior of 3I/ATLAS compared to previous interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The primary objectives of the observations were to look at the colors of the comet, which provide clues to the composition and sizes of the dust particles in the coma, and to take spectra for a direct measure of the chemistry." 
    <br>— Karen Meech, astronomer at the University of Hawai'i
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder. It reminds us that our Solar System is just one part of a vast and dynamic galaxy – and that even the most fleeting visitors can leave a lasting impact."
    <br>— Karen Meech, astronomer at the University of Hawai'i
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is distinct from previous interstellar comets, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike typical comets, which activate closer to the Sun, 3I/ATLAS began to show activity beyond Jupiter's orbit due to its unique ice composition. The high concentration of carbon dioxide ice allows it to become active at greater distances from the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS will continue as astronomers analyze its tail and overall behavior. The research aims to enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their significance within the cosmos.</p>
