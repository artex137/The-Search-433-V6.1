      <h2>Mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS confounds scientists with unusual composition and behaviors</h2>

<p>Scientists are investigating the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, the third known object from beyond our solar system, which was initially detected in early July as it approached the Sun. The object has garnered interest due to its unusual composition and behavior, presenting no injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This investigation is significant as it may provide insights into the origins and characteristics of interstellar bodies. Researchers are utilizing four major telescopes, including NASA's Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope, to analyze the object further.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>First observations of 3I/ATLAS revealed it was active from six astronomical units away from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Highest carbon dioxide to water ratio ever observed in a comet.</li>
    <li>Expected flybys include Jupiter, Mars, and Venus.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter may observe the object at a distance of less than two million miles from Mars.</li>
    <li>NASA's Juno probe may intersect with 3I/ATLAS as it nears Jupiter in six months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in early July 2023 as it approached the Sun. Observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) indicated that the object was already bright and active from a distance exceeding Jupiter's orbit. Subsequent analysis from SPHEREx and the James Webb Space Telescope revealed an unusual carbon dioxide to water ratio in the object’s coma. NASA's Hubble telescope captured images of a distinctive "teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust" from the icy nucleus of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This finding marks the highest carbon dioxide to water ratio ever observed in a comet,” said an unnamed researcher involved in the study.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We are still trying to decipher the origins of 3I/ATLAS,” stated Avi Loeb, an astronomer from Harvard. “This object could be of extraterrestrial origin.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unusual characteristics have prompted comparisons with these earlier objects, which also sparked significant interest in the scientific community. The study of such objects may enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are awaiting further analysis and peer review of the data collected on 3I/ATLAS. The object is set to make flybys of several planets, providing potential opportunities for closer observation by space agencies.</p>
