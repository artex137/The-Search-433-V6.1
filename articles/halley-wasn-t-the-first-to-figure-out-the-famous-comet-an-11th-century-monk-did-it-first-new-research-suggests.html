      <h2>Halley's Comet's Discovery Attributed to 11th-Century Monk, New Research Finds</h2>

<p>New research suggests that an 11th-century monk named Eilmer of Malmesbury may have been the first to connect observations of Halley's Comet, more than 600 years before British astronomer Edmond Halley made his calculations in 1705. Eilmer reportedly observed the comet twice: once as a child in 989 and again as an adult in 1066.</p>

<p>This finding could reshape the historical narrative surrounding Halley's Comet, which is named after Halley for his work in establishing its periodicity. Simon Portegies Zwart, an astronomer at Leiden University, argues that Eilmer's connection of the two sightings demonstrates an early understanding of the comet's recurring nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> Halley's Comet</li>
  <li><strong>First Observation by Eilmer:</strong> 989</li>
  <li><strong>Second Observation by Eilmer:</strong> 1066</li>
  <li><strong>Research Author:</strong> Simon Portegies Zwart</li>
  <li><strong>Book Title:</strong> "Dorestad and Everything After: Ports, Townscapes and Travelers in Europe, 800-1100"</li>
  <li><strong>Next Pass of Halley's Comet:</strong> Late July 2061</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 989, Eilmer of Malmesbury reportedly witnessed a comet during his childhood. He later observed the same comet again in 1066, a time marked by significant political upheaval in England following the death of King Edward the Confessor.</p>
<p>According to 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury, Eilmer recognized the comet upon its return, expressing concern over its implications for England's future.</p>
<p>In 1705, Edmond Halley published his findings on the comet's periodic orbit, which has since been recognized as the first periodic comet. Eilmer's earlier observations have now gained renewed attention due to recent research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You've come, have you?...It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now, you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my mother-country.”</blockquote>
<p>- Simon Portegies Zwart, regarding Eilmer's second observation of the comet in 1066.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Halley's Comet is renowned for its highly elliptical orbit, which brings it close to Earth every 72 to 80 years. Historical records of the comet date back to 239 B.C. in China, with numerous sightings interpreted as omens throughout history.</p>
<p>William the Conqueror's 1066 invasion of England was notably documented in the Bayeux Tapestry, which includes imagery of Halley's Comet, illustrating its significance in historical events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research findings will be included in a forthcoming book, scheduled to be published in 2025, which may prompt further discussions on the contributions of early astronomers like Eilmer in the study of celestial phenomena.</p>
