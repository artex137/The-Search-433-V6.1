      <h2>Harvard Scientist Claims Comet 3I/ATLAS May Be Intelligent Interstellar Visitor</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has claimed that comet 3I/ATLAS, detected by Chile’s ATLAS project telescope on July 1, 2025, may not just be a comet but potentially an intelligent interstellar visitor. This assertion has sparked significant debate in the scientific community regarding the nature of the object, which is only the third interstellar visitor recorded in astronomy.</p>

<p>The comet's unusual characteristics, including its “anti-tail” and chemical composition, challenge conventional understanding of comets and raise questions about extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), are monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely, emphasizing its scientific value despite posing no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at approximately 130 million miles.</li>
    <li>Passed near Earth’s orbit on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of 20 kilometers, making it the largest interstellar object detected.</li>
    <li>Traveling at 60 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Comet's activity began at a distance from the Sun, unlike typical comets.</li>
    <li>Confirmed by Spain’s Nordic Optical Telescope and NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS project telescope in Chile detected the comet, which was later named 3I/ATLAS. It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at a distance of approximately 130 million miles. The comet then passed near Earth’s orbit on December 19, 2025, without posing any threat. Observations during its approach revealed its unique anti-tail and chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The object has shown several anomalous features that lead us to hypothesize a possible technological and even hostile origin.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb described the discovery as a “black swan” event, emphasizing its potential impact on our understanding of astronomy.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This bold hypothesis from Loeb is not without precedent. In 2019, he suggested that ‘Oumuamua, the first detected interstellar object, might be an alien probe. His recent claims about 3I/ATLAS extend that line of thinking, suggesting a pattern of potential extraterrestrial artifacts in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS recedes from the Sun, it will temporarily disappear behind it in late October before reappearing in the constellations Virgo and Leo. Ongoing studies will continue to examine its characteristics and implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>
