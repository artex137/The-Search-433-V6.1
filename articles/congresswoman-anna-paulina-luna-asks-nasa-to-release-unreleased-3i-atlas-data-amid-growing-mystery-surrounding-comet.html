      <h2>Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna asks NASA to release unreleased 3I/ATLAS data amid growing mystery surrounding comet</h2>

<p>U.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna has requested NASA to disclose unreleased information related to the object 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to pass by Earth next month. The nature of the object remains unclear, with researchers not definitively stating whether it is a comet or something else.</p>

<p>Luna shared her letter to NASA on X (formerly Twitter) on November 3, 2025. In her correspondence, she highlighted the importance of releasing all available information regarding 3I/ATLAS and other related objects, as this data could enhance understanding of interstellar phenomena and their interactions with our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass within 170 million miles of Earth next month.</li>
    <li>Luna's letter to NASA was posted on November 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object was first discovered in July 2025 by a NASA telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS last month using its HiRISE camera.</li>
    <li>The object has undergone multiple color changes, appearing green in September and blue recently.</li>
    <li>Luna has requested data from the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, including details on a meteor detected near Papua New Guinea about ten years ago.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 by a NASA telescope in Chile, which confirmed that it originated outside the Earth’s solar system. In September 2025, the object appeared green. By October 3, 2025, when it passed near Mars, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of it. Recently, the object has been observed to change color to blue.</p>

<p>On November 3, 2025, Anna Paulina Luna publicly requested NASA to release data related to 3I/ATLAS and other celestial objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visions and their interactions with our solar system.” 
    — Anna Paulina Luna
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “To further enhance our understanding, I encourage NASA to fund additional observations of 3I/ATLAS by the Juno mission near Jupiter, utilizing all available instruments, including its radio sensors.” 
    — Anna Paulina Luna
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “More time would be lost if the agency were to continue hiding the details.” 
    — Avi Loeb, Professor of Science at Harvard University
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The object 3I/ATLAS has gained significant public interest due to its unusual color changes and its potential implications for understanding interstellar objects. The recent shift from green to blue has sparked speculation, with some suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft. The release of additional data could provide clarity on these claims and the object's nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has not disclosed when it will respond to Luna's request for information. Observations of 3I/ATLAS are expected to continue as it approaches Earth, and further analysis of its interactions with the solar environment may provide more insights.</p>
