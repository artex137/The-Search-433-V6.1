      <h2>3I/ATLAS Glows in X-ray Light</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed glowing in x-ray light by the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton observatory on 3 December 2025, approximately 285 million km from the spacecraft. This latest image provides a unique view of the interstellar comet, which is one of only three known to have originated from outside our Solar System.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it enhances our understanding of 3I/ATLAS and its composition. Scientists believe that gathering data on this comet is crucial before it exits the Solar System permanently. The XMM-Newton mission spent around 20 hours capturing this rare glimpse of 3I/ATLAS, utilizing its European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC)-pn for sensitive x-ray detection.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: 3 December 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from XMM-Newton: 285 million km (177 million miles)</li>
    <li>Duration of observation: 20 hours</li>
    <li>Observatory: European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton</li>
    <li>Camera used: European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC)-pn</li>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Number of interstellar comets known: 3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 and has since been observed in various wavelengths by multiple telescopes and space missions. Notable observations include infrared images from the James Webb Space Telescope and visual captures from ground-based telescopes like the Gemini South and Very Large Telescope.</p>
<p>The latest x-ray images were taken by XMM-Newton on 3 December 2025, revealing the comet's interaction with solar wind, which causes it to glow in low-energy x-ray light.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The more we point our telescopes and spacecraft at this mysterious interstellar visitor, the more we learn,” said a representative from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar comets have been identified. This rarity makes 3I/ATLAS a valuable object of study for scientists aiming to understand the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from outside our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from XMM-Newton and other observatories to gather more information about 3I/ATLAS before it leaves the Solar System. Further observations are planned to enhance our understanding of its gases and composition.</p>
