      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS to Appear in Fall Skies</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to become visible in the night sky towards the end of October 2025 after making its first pass through our solar system, astronomers have confirmed. The comet will be visible from Earth as it emerges from the predawn twilight, although its brightness will require a telescope for clear observation.</p>

<p>This event is significant for stargazers, as it coincides with a number of meteor showers and supermoons this autumn. Authorities and observatories are preparing to provide updates and observations as the comet approaches its brightest phase, which is expected to occur from late October through early November.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Predicted brightness: magnitude +14.9 to +15.</li>
    <li>Visible late October to early November 2025.</li>
    <li>First pass through the solar system after arriving from interstellar space.</li>
    <li>Last observed dimly until mid-October.</li>
    <li>Best visibility requires a telescope with at least a 10-inch aperture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers announced the discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, telescopes on Earth and in space have tracked its size and composition. The comet has remained too dim for backyard telescopes until now, as it swings around the opposite side of the Sun from Earth.</p>
<p>As of mid-October, Comet 3I/ATLAS will be out of sight, but it is expected to reappear towards the end of the month, becoming visible in the predawn sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet is a unique opportunity for astronomers and stargazers alike. It is exciting to witness its first appearance in our solar system,” said an unnamed astronomer involved in the tracking of the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS's discovery and upcoming visibility come at a time when several astronomical events are occurring, including multiple meteor showers and supermoons. The fall season in 2025 will feature three supermoons, with the first, the Harvest Moon, set to rise on October 6.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches its brightest phase, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and provide updates for stargazers. Observatories are preparing to capture images and share insights as Comet 3I/ATLAS becomes more visible in late October and early November.</p>
