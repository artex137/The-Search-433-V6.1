      <h2>NASA releases closest images ever of Comet 3I/ATLAS and reveals the secrets of this stellar traveller</h2>

<p>NASA has released unprecedented images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS taken from Mars on October 2, 2025. The images reveal the comet's composition and a mysterious glow that has generated interest among scientists. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this space event.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it enhances understanding of the comet's origins and composition. As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth in December 2025, experts are analyzing the data to uncover clues about the comet, which is travelling at a speed of 130,000 miles per hour and has the highest velocity recorded for a solar system visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS flew past Mars at a distance of 30 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>It was discovered in September 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately a few kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system.</li>
    <li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of the comet's nucleus and coma.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to approach Earth at a distance of 300 million kilometers in December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 2025, the ATLAS system discovered comet 3I/ATLAS in Chile. On October 2, 2025, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took images of the comet as it passed by Mars. These images revealed a nucleus wrapped in a coma measuring 1,500 kilometers wide.</p>
<p>The comet's unique characteristics, including its composition and glow, have been studied by multiple spacecraft, satellites, and telescopes, providing insights into its origins and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “These images are not just beautiful snapshots of the cosmos; they tell a fascinating scientific story,” said a NASA representative.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The white glow and blue halo reveal particles rich in water ice and carbon dioxide, confirming that it is a genuine comet,” explained a researcher involved in the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. The hyperbolic orbit indicates that it is not bound to the Sun and will exit the solar system after its visit. The comet's composition has sparked discussions among scientists and the public, especially regarding its origin and the potential for extraterrestrial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its approach, NASA and other space agencies will analyze the data collected from various observations to further understand the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>
