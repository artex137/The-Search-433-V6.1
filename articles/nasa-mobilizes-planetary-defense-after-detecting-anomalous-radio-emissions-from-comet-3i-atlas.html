      <h2>NASA mobilizes planetary defense after detecting anomalous radio emissions from comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The international scientific community has mobilized in response to the detection of anomalous radio emissions from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS astronomical survey system. The comet is currently being monitored by NASA and international partners as it travels through our solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third known interstellar comet and presents a unique opportunity to study materials from another star system. NASA has activated its Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) to continuously monitor the comet and investigate the source of the unusual radio signals, which were first recorded on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Anomalous radio emissions detected on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Signal frequency measured at 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA has activated its Planetary Defense Coordination Office for monitoring.</li>
    <li>International collaboration includes agencies like the European Space Agency (ESA).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS astronomical survey system discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. The object gained attention for its interstellar origin and subsequently emitted unusual radio signals. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope captured the first evidence of these emissions, which were confirmed to originate from the comet itself. Following this, NASA activated its PDCO to coordinate monitoring and research efforts. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While 3I/ATLAS does not pose an impact threat, this event serves as a crucial test for the global surveillance network,” a NASA spokesperson said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS follows prior events involving interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These earlier visitors have provided insights into the formation of planetary systems. The current monitoring emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in planetary defense, particularly in tracking objects that cross our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to analyze the comet's emissions and trajectory leading up to its closest approach in December. This investigation aims to enhance understanding of its composition and the potential implications of its unique signals.</p>
