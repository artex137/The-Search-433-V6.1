      <h2>Green Country amateur astro-photographer 'chasing' interstellar comet</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet "3I/Atlas" has become a focal point for astronomers and enthusiasts alike, particularly for Scott Bratt, a firefighter in Green Country, Oklahoma. The comet will be visible to telescopes beginning November 12 in early morning hours.</p>

<p>3I/Atlas has attracted global interest due to its unique characteristics, which are not typically seen in comets from our solar system. As scientists study the comet, Bratt and his wife, Kit, aim to share their observations with the public through their YouTube channel and local astronomy events.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas to be visible starting November 12.</li>
    <li>Scott Bratt is an amateur comet chaser and volunteer firefighter.</li>
    <li>The Astronomy Club of Tulsa will hold a Guest and Members Night on November 15.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object identified passing through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Bratt confirmed he does not believe the comet is an alien spacecraft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/Atlas has recently passed by the sun and is now heading out of the solar system. Scott Bratt has been preparing to observe the comet in the early morning hours, specifically targeting the small window before sunrise.</p>

<p>On November 11, Bratt spoke with 2 News, discussing the comet's significance and its anomalous tail that did not appear when it was near the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is an early morning target, and you've got a small window to try to catch it (before sunrise),” Scott Bratt told 2 News on November 11.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It's a novelty because it's an interstellar traveler, but it's still just a comet passing through,” Bratt added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“And seeing the kids come out and look through your scopes... is really neat,” said Kit Bratt regarding their outreach efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is significant as it is only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. Its unique characteristics provide an opportunity for scientists to study material from beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>The Astronomy Club of Tulsa actively engages the community, promoting interest in astronomy through outreach events and public viewings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet becomes visible, Scott and Kit Bratt plan to document their observations and share their findings with the public. The Astronomy Club of Tulsa will host discussions focusing on 3I/Atlas and recent solar activity on November 15.</p>
