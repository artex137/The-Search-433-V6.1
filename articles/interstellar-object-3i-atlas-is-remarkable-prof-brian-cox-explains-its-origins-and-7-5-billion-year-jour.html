      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is remarkable: Prof Brian Cox explains its origins and 7.5-billion-year journey</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), has garnered significant attention from scientists and space enthusiasts globally. Renowned physicist Professor Brian Cox describes the comet as a remarkable time capsule from the early universe, showcasing its extraordinary journey of 7.5 billion years through interstellar space.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it provides insights into the conditions of the early galaxy and the origins of material from other stellar systems. Authorities and scientists continue to study 3I/ATLAS to better understand its composition and trajectory, which may offer clues about the formation of the solar system and beyond.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on 1 July 2025 by ATLAS</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 7.5 billion years</li>
    <li>Speed: approximately 58 kilometres per second</li>
    <li>Trajectory: hyperbolic orbit, indicating it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun</li>
    <li>Observed by ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025, marking its entry into the Solar System. It has been travelling through interstellar space for billions of years, predating the formation of the Sun and Earth. Observations from various space agencies have confirmed its status as a comet and provided detailed images of its journey.</p>
<p>Following its discovery, scientists have monitored its trajectory and composition, revealing that it carries material from the early galaxy. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) is set to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object was made before the Earth and the Sun had formed. It has been travelling across the Milky Way for billions of years. What I find remarkable is that only 400 years ago we were still debating whether the Earth orbits the Sun,” said Professor Brian Cox in an interview with the BBC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Now we have sent spacecraft to the planets that Kepler and others saw moving in the sky, and we are taking photographs of interstellar comets from the surface and orbits of other planets. That, to me, is a remarkable story,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS is crucial for understanding the composition and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. The advances in astronomical technology over the past few centuries have allowed scientists to observe and analyze such distant objects in unprecedented detail.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, have also sparked interest in the scientific community, highlighting the need for continued research into the origins and characteristics of these cosmic visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System. Ongoing studies will focus on its unique composition and the implications for understanding galactic evolution and comet formation.</p>
