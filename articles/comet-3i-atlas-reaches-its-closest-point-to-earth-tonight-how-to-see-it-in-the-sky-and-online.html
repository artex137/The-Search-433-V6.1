      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches its closest point to Earth tonight</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth overnight from Thursday to Friday, December 18 to 19, 2025, coming within 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) of the planet. There are no injuries or fatalities reported, and the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This event marks a unique opportunity for skywatchers and astronomers, as Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected. Authorities and astronomers are encouraging the public to observe the comet, which was discovered in July 2025, by providing various viewing options, including online webcasts and telescope guidance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar comets: 1I/'Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>Online viewing: Free webcast by the Virtual Telescope Project starting at 11 p.m. EST on December 18</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. It is now on its trajectory away from the sun and out of the solar system. The comet will reach its closest point to Earth overnight on December 18-19, 2025, providing a rare opportunity for observation.</p>

<p>NASA has released new images of the comet taken with its Europa Clipper spacecraft, which is currently about 102 million miles (164 million kilometers) from Earth. Observations will continue as the comet approaches.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Though still just under twice the distance from Earth as the sun, it’s a unique opportunity to glimpse an object from another star system,” said a representative from Space.com.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Observers may spot a faint, fuzzy patch of greenish light close to the bright star Regulus in Leo,” according to NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of two previous interstellar comets, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have drawn interest from the scientific community for their origins and characteristics. Comet 3I/ATLAS’s approach provides further insight into interstellar objects and their behavior as they travel through our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach, Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue to move away from the sun and out of the solar system. Astronomers will monitor its trajectory and any new data that emerges from ongoing observations.</p>
