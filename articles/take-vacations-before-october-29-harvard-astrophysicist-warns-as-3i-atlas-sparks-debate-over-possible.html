      <h2>Harvard astrophysicist warns about interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>A Harvard astrophysicist has warned the public to "take vacations before October 29" regarding the mysterious interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, currently passing through our solar system. The warning has raised questions about whether NASA is withholding important information about the object, which has attracted significant scientific interest due to its unusual size and chemical composition.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its extraordinary characteristics, including an estimated size of 5.6 kilometres and a weight of about 33 billion tons. Its unusual behavior and chemical composition have sparked debates within the scientific community about its possible origins, with some suggesting it may not be a natural object. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will safely pass through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 5.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>The object weighs around 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>It emits nickel tetracarbonyl, a compound typically associated with industrial processes on Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is moving at nearly double the speed of previous interstellar objects.</li>
    <li>First detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Nasa has reassured the public that there is no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023. Observations made using Hawaii's Keck II telescope revealed its unique chemical signature and unusual behavior, leading to discussions about its potential origins. Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor, has suggested that the object may have artificial origins due to its distinct composition.</p>
<p>In subsequent discussions, Loeb has criticized NASA for allegedly delaying the release of images and data related to 3I/ATLAS. He has called for greater transparency from the agency concerning the object’s observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Who cares about the communication departments? We want to see the data from the scientists,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, expressing concerns over NASA's transparency regarding 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Each observation is like opening a window into the Universe's past. It allows us to study the evolution of materials that were formed around other stars,” stated Dr. Pérez Couto from Spain’s University of A Coruña, who supports a conventional explanation for the object.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has divided the scientific community. Some researchers view it as evidence of intelligent design or advanced extraterrestrial technology, while others argue for natural explanations. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have also sparked similar debates regarding their origins and implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and analyses of 3I/ATLAS are expected as the object continues its path through the solar system. Dr. Loeb's warning about taking vacations before October 29 may align with upcoming data releases that could provide more insights into the object.</p>
