      <h2>Arizona's scariest lore: The Phoenix Lights</h2>

<p>The Phoenix Lights, a series of widely reported UFO sightings, have been named Arizona's scariest lore in a recent reader poll, surpassing tales of ghosts and Skinwalkers. The sightings occurred on March 13, 1997, over Arizona, Nevada, and Sonora, Mexico, with thousands of witnesses reporting a triangular formation of lights moving silently across the night sky.</p>

<p>This matter continues to be significant as many locals remain skeptical of the official explanation provided by the U.S. Air Force. The Air Force stated the lights were flares from a military training exercise, a claim that many witnesses dispute, maintaining that the lights they observed did not resemble flares.</p>
