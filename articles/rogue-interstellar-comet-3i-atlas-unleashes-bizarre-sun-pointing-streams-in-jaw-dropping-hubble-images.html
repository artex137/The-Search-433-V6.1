      <h2>Rogue Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Unleashes Bizarre Sun-Pointing Streams In Jaw-Dropping Hubble Images</h2>

<p>A rogue comet from another star system, known as 3I/ATLAS, has displayed unusual sun-pointing dust streams, captured in high-resolution images by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. This comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, has prompted significant scientific interest due to its unique behaviour as it travels through our solar system.</p>

<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS challenge existing models of comet behaviour. Scientists are investigating the implications of these findings, as the comet's sunward structures could provide insights into the processes governing interstellar objects. The data gathered from this comet may refine our understanding of cometary physics and the dynamics of celestial bodies formed under different astrophysical conditions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Confirmed as an interstellar object</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Traveling at over 130,000 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observing agencies:</strong> NASA, ESA, Hubble, SOHO, STEREO, Webb, MAVEN, JUICE</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. The comet has since been observed by multiple space agencies using various instruments to capture its unique characteristics.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, providing researchers with critical data regarding its behaviour and composition. The Hubble Space Telescope captured unprecedented images of the comet, revealing tightly collimated dust streams directed towards the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a rare laboratory for studying pristine material from another star system,” said a mission scientist during a NASA/ESA live webcast on November 19, 2025.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS is not simply an oddity but may reflect fundamental processes unique to bodies formed under astrophysical conditions unlike those in the solar system,” stated an independent astronomer, highlighting the significance of the comet's observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Each of these comets has provided valuable insights into the diversity of planetary system debris and the conditions beyond our solar neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The peculiar behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has led astronomers to reassess existing comet models, particularly concerning dust emission at significant distances from the Sun, where traditional cometary activity is typically limited.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS exits our solar system, scientists are racing to analyze the data collected from Hubble and other observatories. The findings may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of how interstellar objects behave when influenced by solar forces, further contributing to the study of cosmic building blocks.</p>
