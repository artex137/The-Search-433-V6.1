      <h2>Other ATLAS Comet Appears Fragmented After Close Encounter with The Sun</h2>

<p>New images of comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) show that it has fragmented after its close approach to the sun last month. The observations were made by The Virtual Telescope Project 2.0 last week, following reports of two outbursts documented in The Astronomer’s Telegram.</p>

<p>This fragmentation is significant for astronomers as it may provide insights into the comet's composition. Gianluca Masi, an Italian astronomer, has shared updates and images of the comet, highlighting its “double” nucleus and additional debris clouds. Researchers are now closely monitoring the comet as it approaches Earth on November 25.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was identified in May 2023.</li>
    <li>It reached its perihelion on October 8, coming within 0.335 astronomical units (31,180,206 miles) of the sun.</li>
    <li>Two outbursts were observed between October 31 and November 4, according to The Astronomer’s Telegram.</li>
    <li>The comet will be closest to Earth on November 25, at a distance of 0.403 AU (37,488,865 kilometers).</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project 2.0 has provided updated images of the comet showing its fragmentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was first identified in May 2023 by astronomers involved in the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System. It reached its perihelion on October 8, 2023. Between October 31 and November 4, two apparent outbursts were observed, indicating changes in brightness.</p>

<p>On November 10, an email notice from The Astronomer’s Telegram reported two leading fragments, with one fragment appearing brighter than the other. The Virtual Telescope Project 2.0 captured new images over several days, showing significant changes in the comet's structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Several parts (sub-nuclei or clouds of debris) are still visible, with an interesting arc-like feature on the left, in the solar direction,” said Gianluca Masi on November 14.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “While the comet may not have made its journey to and from the sun fully intact, its fragmentation may offer astronomers the chance to explore its composition in more detail,” said Elena Mazzotta Epifani, a research astronomer at the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF).
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The fragmentation of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) follows a trend observed in other comets that have passed close to the sun. These events often result in changes to the comet's structure due to extreme heat and gravitational forces. Previous instances of comet fragmentation have provided valuable data for researchers studying the composition and behavior of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) as it approaches Earth. Observations will focus on the comet's remaining fragments and any further changes in its brightness or structure.</p>
