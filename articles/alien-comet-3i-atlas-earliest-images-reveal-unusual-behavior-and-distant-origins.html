      <h2>Alien Comet 3I/ATLAS: Earliest images reveal unusual behavior and distant origins</h2>

<p>Astronomers at Michigan State University have released new images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, showing unexpected activity long before its official discovery in July 2025. The comet has been observed emitting gas and dust while situated approximately six times the Earth-Sun distance, or about 558 million miles away.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS possesses a chemical composition that differs from typical comets, indicating it may have formed in an alien solar system under distinct conditions. Researchers are examining the implications of this behavior and how it could alter our understanding of cometary formation and solar system evolution.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was actively shedding material before its identification in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Images were captured by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) between May 7 and June 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was located about 558 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>Research findings were published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS displayed a tail while near the orbit of Saturn, indicating unusual thermal properties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers have traced the activity of 3I/ATLAS back to observations made by TESS. The satellite captured images of the comet from May 7 to June 2, 2025, revealing its unexpected brightness and activity that preceded its formal discovery in July. This early detection has prompted further examination of its unique characteristics.</p>

<p>Following the discovery, astronomers noted that the comet's behavior challenges previous assumptions about how comets typically activate as they approach the Sun. The findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS may contain volatile compounds that can vaporize at lower temperatures, differing from the behavior of standard comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS gives us an opportunity to study other solar systems up close and personal, without actually needing to visit them,” said Adina Feinstein, assistant professor of physics and astronomy at MSU.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Capturing as many observations from this prediscovery period... is essential to our understanding of how these objects ‘turn on’ as they approach our sun,” stated John Noonan, a postdoctoral fellow at Auburn University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS contributes to a growing body of research on interstellar objects and their origins. Prior discoveries have indicated that many comets may contain diverse chemical compositions, which could influence our understanding of planetary formation and evolution across the galaxy.</p>

<p>The implications of these findings extend beyond this individual comet, suggesting that the chemical diversity of planetary systems may be greater than previously thought.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS and its properties as more data becomes available. Ongoing observations will help to clarify the comet's origins and the broader implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>
