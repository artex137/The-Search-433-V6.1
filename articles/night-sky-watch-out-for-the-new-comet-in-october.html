      <h2>New Comet C/2025 R2 Set to Brighten Night Sky in October</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) is expected to become more visible in the northern hemisphere as it climbs higher in the western sky after sunset in October. The comet, currently difficult to observe due to glare from evening twilight, will be at its closest point to Earth on October 19, when it will be approximately 24 million miles away.</p>

<p>This event is significant for amateur astronomers and skywatchers, as Comet C/2025 R2 has a long orbital period of 22,000 years, meaning it will not return until around the year 24,579. Authorities are advising those interested to prepare their binoculars, ideally 8x42mm or 10x42mm, for a better chance to spot the comet as it becomes more prominent.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) will be at its closest point to Earth on October 19.</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth on October 19: approximately 24 million miles.</li>
    <li>Current visibility: difficult due to evening twilight glare.</li>
    <li>Optimal binocular sizes for viewing: 8x42mm or 10x42mm.</li>
    <li>Orbital period: 22,000 years.</li>
    <li>Discovered on September 12 by a spacecraft observing the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 12, Comet C/2025 R2 was discovered by a spacecraft sent to study the Sun. Since then, it has been observed developing a bright tail. As of late September, the comet remains challenging to view due to twilight glare but is expected to become more visible starting in October.</p>

<p>On October 3, Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass Mars at a distance of 18.6 million miles. Comet C/2025 R2 will reach its closest approach to Earth on October 19.</p>

<p>Finally, Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass Earth on December 19, at a distance of 167 million miles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The phrase ‘once in a lifetime’ is often bandied around when it comes to comets and this one is no exception,” said an astronomy expert regarding Comet C/2025 R2.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 R2 is the latest in a series of notable comets. It has replaced the temporary designation of Comet 25B Swan. In contrast, Halley’s Comet, which orbits every 76 years, is expected to return in 2061. Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor, will not return to the inner solar system once it leaves.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to prepare for viewing opportunities in October as Comet C/2025 R2 becomes more visible. Observers should remain alert for updates on visibility as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>
