      <h2>NASA detects organic molecules associated with prebiological chemistry on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has detected organic molecules linked to prebiological chemistry on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, according to a recent announcement made on February 20, 2026. The discovery occurred as the comet approached the inner solar system, providing a unique opportunity for scientific study.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it may offer insights into the building blocks of life and the origins of organic matter in the universe. NASA has stated that the data collected from 3I/ATLAS will enhance our understanding of comet composition and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected by NASA's observations during its approach to the inner solar system.</li>
    <li>The announcement was made on February 20, 2026.</li>
    <li>Organic molecules associated with prebiological chemistry have been identified.</li>
    <li>The study aims to understand the origins of organic matter in the universe.</li>
    <li>Data collection is ongoing as the comet continues its trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA first observed comet 3I/ATLAS during its initial approach to the solar system. Subsequent analyses revealed the presence of organic molecules, prompting further investigation into the comet's composition.</p>

<p>The findings were officially announced on February 20, 2026, highlighting the importance of this discovery for astrobiology and the study of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The presence of organic molecules on 3I/ATLAS could provide critical insights into the building blocks of life,” NASA officials stated during the announcement.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery aligns with ongoing research into the chemical makeup of comets, which are considered time capsules of the early solar system. Previous studies have suggested that comets may have played a role in delivering organic materials to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, with further analyses expected to yield additional data on its composition and implications for the origins of life in the universe.</p>
