      <h2>A rare comet from beyond our solar system is being closely tracked – what can it teach us?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, the third interstellar comet detected, has entered the solar system and is being closely monitored by astronomers since its discovery in July 2023. The comet, which poses no threat to Earth, is expected to provide valuable insights into the materials and conditions of other star systems.</p>

<p>Understanding 3I/Atlas is significant because it allows scientists to study the composition of materials from beyond our solar system. Various space agencies are actively tracking the comet as it approaches the sun, which will enhance its visibility and provide opportunities for closer observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was first detected in July 2023.</li>
  <li>It is the third known interstellar comet after 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
  <li>The comet is estimated to be between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
  <li>The closest approach to Earth will be 240 million km, more than 1.5 times the distance between Earth and the sun.</li>
  <li>Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope show an unusual “anti-tail” in the comet's coma.</li>
  <li>The European Southern Observatory detected a high nickel to iron ratio in the comet's plume.</li>
  <li>Images have been captured by the European Space Agency’s Mars missions as the comet passed 30 million km from Mars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers detected Comet 3I/Atlas as it entered the solar system. The comet's trajectory has been closely monitored, particularly as it approaches the sun, where it is expected to release more gas and dust for analysis. Astronomers are utilizing various telescopes and space missions to gather data on the comet's composition and behaviour.</p>

<p>Notably, the comet will pass behind the sun during its closest approach to Earth but is expected to re-emerge in late November 2023, providing another opportunity for observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These objects are the first building blocks we can observe from those systems,” said Michael Küeppers, project scientist on the European Space Agency’s comet interceptor mission, Hera.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet. There’s no reason to think it’s something else,” Küeppers added regarding the nature of 3I/Atlas.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is part of a rare group of interstellar comets, with only two others observed in the past decade. The study of interstellar comets is crucial as they offer unique insights into the building blocks of other star systems, which are otherwise difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>While many comets originate from the Kuiper Belt and Oort cloud within our solar system, interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas provide a glimpse into the materials that exist in other stellar environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers plan to continue observing Comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches the sun and re-emerges in late November 2023. They will utilize ground and space-based telescopes, as well as Mars orbiters and rovers, to gather more data on the comet's characteristics and behaviour.</p>
