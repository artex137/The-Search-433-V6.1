      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: what NASA discovered after its historic passage close to Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has reported significant findings following the historic passage of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS through our solar system in December 2025. The comet, which posed no threat to Earth, has provided a unique opportunity for scientists to study a celestial body originating from another star system.</p>

<p>This event marks a milestone in astronomical research, as it has prompted one of the largest observation campaigns ever coordinated by NASA. More than a dozen space missions and ground-based telescopes have participated in the effort to understand the composition and behavior of the comet, which is redefining knowledge about planet formation and the chemical diversity of the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in the Atacama Desert, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet traveled at approximately 246,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 273 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest point to the Sun) was on October 29, 2025, at 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Observations included contributions from the James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, and Mars missions.</li>
    <li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of the comet from 30.6 million kilometers away on October 3, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The journey of 3I/ATLAS began on July 1, 2025, when it was detected by the ATLAS telescope. Initial observations classified it as an asteroid due to its speed. However, further analysis revealed its hyperbolic orbit, confirming it was an interstellar object.</p>

<p>Following this confirmation, a global alert was issued through the International Asteroid Warning Network, leading to a coordinated observation campaign. The comet was observed as it approached the Sun, where it exhibited typical cometary behavior, including the formation of a coma.</p>

<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, and on December 19, it made its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All evidence – from trajectory to chemical composition and outgassing behavior – was consistent with that of a naturally occurring comet,” said Amit Kshatriya, a NASA administrator.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The passage of 3I/ATLAS has provided insights into the chemical diversity of celestial bodies in the galaxy. The data collected from this event is enhancing scientists’ understanding of the formation of planetary systems and the materials that comprise them. This is particularly significant as it suggests that interstellar objects may be more common than previously thought.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS throughout 2026. The findings are expected to refine models of planet formation and improve detection strategies for future interstellar visitors.</p>
