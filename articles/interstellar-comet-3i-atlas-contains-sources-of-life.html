      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Contains Sources of Life</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected unprecedented amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently leaving our solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as methanol and hydrogen cyanide are considered key elements for the formation of life, including DNA and RNA molecules. Researchers are studying the comet’s unusual chemical composition and behavior, as it has demonstrated characteristics not observed in other comets within the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS ejects approximately <strong>40 kg</strong> of methanol per second.</li>
    <li>Methanol accounts for about <strong>8%</strong> of the comet’s total emissions.</li>
    <li>Hydrogen cyanide is ejected at a rate of <strong>250 to 500 grams</strong> per second.</li>
    <li>This is the <strong>third interstellar object</strong> identified by astronomers this year.</li>
    <li>Observations were made using the <strong>ALMA radio telescope</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers have monitored 3I/ATLAS as it travels through our solar system. During observations with the ALMA radio telescope, they detected significant amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide in the comet’s nucleus and coma. These detections are notable because no other comet in the Solar System has shown such high concentrations of these compounds.</p>
<p>The comet is noted for its unique behavior and chemical composition, indicating it likely formed in a different solar system under distinct conditions. This data has led to discussions regarding the potential implications for the origin of life on Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University, stated, "The anomalously high concentrations of methanol and hydrogen cyanide indicate the comet’s 'friendly nature' and pose no threat."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also mentioned, "Similar objects could have delivered the 'building blocks' of life to Earth billions of years ago."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, scientists had not detected methanol in other interstellar objects. The high concentration levels found in 3I/ATLAS have sparked interest in the potential for other celestial bodies to contribute to the origins of life.</p>
<p>The comet's unique characteristics have led to speculation about its origins and the conditions under which it formed, enhancing our understanding of the diversity of celestial bodies in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Solar System. They aim to further understand the implications of its chemical composition and what it may reveal about the origins of life on Earth and elsewhere in the universe.</p>
