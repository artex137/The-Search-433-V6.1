      <h2>Don't Miss It: Comet 3I/ATLAS Leaving Forever</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, is currently racing away on a hyperbolic trajectory that guarantees it will never return. First detected in July 2025, the comet is captivating astronomers with its unpredictable light changes and rare composition. Skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere have a final chance to witness its departure in the pre-dawn sky through mid-December 2025.</p>

<p>The comet's journey is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study an object from outside our solar system. NASA has confirmed its status as an interstellar object, and its trajectory allows researchers to track its path until it disappears from view. Observations of 3I/ATLAS may yield insights into materials formed beyond our solar neighbourhood.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest solar approach:</strong> 29 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun at perihelion:</strong> 1.4 astronomical units (about 130 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 100,000 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Expected exit from the solar system:</strong> January 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Best viewed in the pre-dawn hours, eastern pre-dawn sky</li>
    <li><strong>Recommended equipment:</strong> Telescope or high-powered binoculars (at least 20 cm in diameter)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. It made its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025, passing about 1.4 astronomical units away. Following this perihelion, the comet is now moving on a hyperbolic path, confirming it is not gravitationally bound to return to the solar system. It is expected to exit the solar system completely around January 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unusual colour changes in 3I/ATLAS suggest the presence of volatile gases and complex hydrocarbons,” according to researchers studying the comet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Its journey offers scientists an unprecedented opportunity to study planetary formation processes beyond our Sun,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS joins 1I/&#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov as one of the few interstellar objects detected in our solar system. These encounters provide valuable data on the composition and behaviour of celestial bodies that originate from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will closely monitor its trajectory and changing characteristics until it fades from view in early January 2026.</p>
