      <h2>Scientists investigate mysterious stop of interstellar object 3I/Atlas near planet Mars</h2>

<p>Scientists have mobilized globally to investigate the interstellar object 3I/Atlas, which performed an unprecedented maneuver by completely stopping its movement for several days near Mars’ orbit in October 2023. This phenomenon, confirmed by multiple space agencies, raises questions about the nature of celestial dynamics and has not resulted in any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>The event is significant as it contradicts established orbital models of interstellar objects. NASA was among the first agencies to validate the observations, ruling out instrumental failures. Scientists are now focused on understanding the causes of this anomaly, which suggests the influence of non-gravitational forces that have not been fully explored.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> October 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Near Mars’ orbit</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies Involved:</strong> NASA and multiple space agencies</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Size:</strong> 320 meters to 5.6 kilometers in diameter</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> Approximately 10 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first detected crossing the Solar System, becoming the third interstellar object identified. In October 2023, it exhibited a mysterious stop near Mars, remaining almost stationary for several days. NASA confirmed the observations, ruling out data errors.</p>
<p>Following this event, the object resumed its trajectory as predicted, with its perihelion occurring at the end of October 2023. It passed through the orbit of Venus in November and is scheduled to encounter Jupiter in March 2024 before exiting the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anomaly suggests the action of non-gravitational forces that are not yet fully understood,” said a NASA representative. “This event challenges our existing models and requires a review of how interstellar objects interact with our Solar System.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/Atlas contrasts with typical expectations for interstellar objects with hyperbolic trajectories. Previous models have primarily focused on gravitational interactions, and this event highlights the need to incorporate additional variables, such as electromagnetic interactions and complex outgassing, into predictive models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research teams are actively analyzing data collected during the object's stoppage. Investigations will focus on the chemical composition of 3I/Atlas and the implications of its behavior for future celestial mechanics studies. Updates to simulation software are anticipated to improve predictions for planetary security and defense.</p>
