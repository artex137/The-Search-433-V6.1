      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: Latest Updates on Location, Visibility, Live Streaming, Date, Time, and Sky Map</h2>

<p>Astronomers have identified Comet 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar object, marking it as the third confirmed visitor from outside our solar system. According to NASA, the comet is scheduled to make its closest pass to the Sun today, October 29, at approximately 11:47 UT, at a distance of over 200 million kilometres (1.36 astronomical units).</p>

<p>This event is significant as it allows scientists to study an interstellar object up close. Following its pass by the Sun, Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to become visible again around November 11 in the eastern sky before dawn, although it will require large telescopes for observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object, the third confirmed visitor from outside our solar system.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) is on October 29 at 11:47 UT.</li>
    <li>Distance at perihelion is approximately 1.36 AU (over 200 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>Expected visibility will return around November 11 in the eastern sky before dawn.</li>
    <li>Observation will require large telescopes, as it will not be visible to the naked eye.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified as an interstellar object by astronomers, making it the third such comet known. It is currently on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun and will eventually exit the solar system.</p>
<p>Today, October 29, the comet is set to make its closest approach to the Sun at approximately 11:47 UT. Following this event, it is expected to become visible again around November 11.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS provides a unique opportunity to study an object from outside our solar system,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects. Previous objects of interest include 'Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, both of which have sparked significant scientific inquiry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its perihelion, astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible again in November, providing further data about its composition and trajectory.</p>
