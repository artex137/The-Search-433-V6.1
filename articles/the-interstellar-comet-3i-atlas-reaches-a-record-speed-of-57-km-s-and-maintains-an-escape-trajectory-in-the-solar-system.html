      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas Reaches Record Speed in Solar System</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has reached a speed of <strong>57 km/s</strong> as it passes through the Solar System, according to the astronomical community. This comet, which is the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, follows a hyperbolic trajectory that prevents it from being captured by the Sun's gravity.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for scientists as it provides insights into the formation of planets outside our solar system. The comet was first identified in July 2025 using the ATLAS system, located in Chile, and has been under continuous observation since then. Authorities have confirmed that 3I/Atlas does not pose any threat to Earth, with its closest approach recorded at approximately <strong>1.8 million kilometers</strong>.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 57 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> 1.8 million kilometers from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring system:</strong> ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System)</li>
    <li><strong>Trajectory type:</strong> Hyperbolic</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar objects:</strong> Oumuamua (26 km/s), Borisov (33 km/s)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/Atlas using the ATLAS monitoring system in Chile. Since its discovery, telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, have captured various images and data regarding the comet's activity and composition.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet's interactions with solar gravity were closely observed, revealing its high speed and unique characteristics. As it nears its perihelion, scientists predict its trajectory will take it past Jupiter in 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The high concentration of carbon dioxide and nickel in 3I/Atlas suggests it formed in a very cold environment, distinct from comets in our solar system,” said an astronomer involved in the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is one of only three known interstellar objects to have entered our solar system. Its discovery has opened new avenues for research into the origins and compositions of celestial bodies from other star systems. The previous interstellar objects, Oumuamua and Borisov, have helped scientists understand the dynamics of such bodies as they traverse through the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its journey, scientists will monitor its approach to Jupiter in 2026. The data collected during this visit will be crucial for advancing knowledge in astrophysics and planetology.</p>
