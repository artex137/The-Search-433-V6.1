      <h2>Green Comet Wierzchoś Approaches Earth with Significant Carbon Dioxide Signature</h2>

<p>Comet C/2024 E1, known as Comet Wierzchoś, is set to make its closest approach to Earth on February 17, 2026, passing approximately 151 million kilometers away. This massive comet, discovered in March 2024 by Polish astronomer Kacper Wierzchoś, is notable for its rich carbon dioxide content and its trajectory indicating it may be permanently expelled from the solar system.</p>

<p>The approach of Comet Wierzchoś is significant for astronomers as it provides an opportunity to study the early conditions of the solar system. The comet is currently being monitored by major observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope, which has reported on its composition and brightness.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: March 2024 by Kacper Wierzchoś at Mount Lemmon Observatory, Arizona</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: February 17, 2026, at approximately 151 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Diameter: Approximately 13.7 kilometers (8.5 miles)</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest point to the Sun): January 20, 2026, at a distance of 84 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Classification: Hyperbolic comet, indicating a one-way trajectory out of the solar system</li>
    <li>Not visible to the naked eye; best viewed with binoculars or telescopes, particularly in the constellation Sculptor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Wierzchoś was discovered on March 2024 by Kacper Wierzchoś. It reached perihelion on January 20, 2026. On February 17, 2026, it will pass closest to Earth, marking a significant event in its trajectory as it heads towards interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The carbon dioxide abundance offers clues about the temperature and chemical conditions that existed when the solar nebula formed over 4.5 billion years ago,” scientists stated regarding the significance of the comet's composition.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Wierzchoś is part of a growing trend of identifying hyperbolic comets, which are characterized by their trajectories that do not return to the Sun. This comet mirrors the fate of 3I/ATLAS, another interstellar visitor identified last year. Researchers are increasingly tracking dynamic cometary pathways, which can both inject and eject objects within the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet Wierzchoś continues its approach, astronomers will monitor its trajectory and carbon dioxide emissions. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to enhance the identification of such outbound bodies in the future, contributing to a deeper understanding of the solar system's dynamics.</p>
