      <h2>Smart telescopes chase the fading interstellar comet 3I ATLAS</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I ATLAS is currently being observed by astronomers as it moves away from our solar system, with peak visibility occurring in the early morning sky over Leo and Cancer. Found by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawai‘i, this comet is notable for being just the third interstellar object detected in our solar system.</p>

<p>This comet presents a unique opportunity for both amateur and professional astronomers to capture images of a rare celestial visitor. Authorities and scientists are utilizing smart telescopes to study the comet’s dust and gas output, comparing it to known solar system comets to gain insights into the composition of other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS in Hawai‘i.</li>
    <li>It is about 2 astronomical units from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet is classified as a hyperbolic object with an eccentricity greater than 1.</li>
    <li>Initial brightness estimates are at magnitude 9–10.</li>
    <li>Observations are primarily conducted using smart telescopes and various astronomy apps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS was first identified by ATLAS in Hawai‘i and has since been observed using the Gemini North and Keck II telescopes on Maunakea. The comet has moved up into the morning sky, transitioning through the constellations Leo and Cancer.</p>
<p>As astronomers track the comet, they have begun to analyze its dust and gas output, applying techniques established during the observation of another interstellar comet, 2I Borisov, in 2019.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I ATLAS is a pristine sample of another star system’s leftovers,” said an astronomer involved in the observation efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS is notable for its rarity, as it is only the third interstellar object confirmed to have passed through our solar system. The previous interstellar objects include ‘Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, and 2I Borisov in 2019. Each of these comets has provided valuable data about the composition of celestial bodies from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I ATLAS continues its journey away from the solar system, astronomers will focus on completing their observations and analyses before it fades from view. Ongoing studies will aim to deepen understanding of the comet’s characteristics and its implications for future interstellar exploration.</p>
