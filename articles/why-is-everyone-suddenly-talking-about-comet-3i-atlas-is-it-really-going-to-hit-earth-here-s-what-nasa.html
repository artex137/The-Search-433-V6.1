      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Captures Global Attention</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has gained significant attention on social media over the past days as a newly observed interstellar object, first spotted by a telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025. NASA has confirmed that this comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study material from outside our solar system. NASA is monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through our solar system, emphasizing that it will not come close to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Discovery:</strong> Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 170 million miles or 270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025, at approximately 1.4 astronomical units (210 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Size Estimate:</strong> Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers wide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by a NASA-supported telescope as part of the ATLAS survey. Following its initial sighting on July 1, astronomers reviewed older images and confirmed its presence in photos taken in mid-June 2025. NASA has characterized this comet as the third interstellar object ever recorded.</p>
<p>On July 21, 2025, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured a clear image of the comet from 277 million miles away, showing its characteristic dust cloud.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS is a rare visitor from deep space, quietly moving past and helping scientists discover more about the universe,” NASA stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There’s no need to worry; it’s something amazing to watch,” NASA added regarding the comet’s trajectory.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable because it is only the third interstellar object discovered. This finding highlights the ongoing exploration of our solar system and the mysteries of space that remain to be uncovered.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, providing valuable data for ongoing research into interstellar objects.</p>
