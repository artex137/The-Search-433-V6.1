      <h2>Could interstellar travel explain 3I/ATLAS mysterious actions near the Sun?</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual behaviour near the Sun, prompting scientists to investigate its strange actions following its perihelion on October 29-30. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as scientists seek to understand the comet's unexpected brightening and other anomalies. Researchers at institutions such as Harvard and the Naval Research Laboratory are exploring whether these phenomena are due to the comet's home planetary system or the effects of interstellar travel.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29-30.</li>
    <li>Notable brightening was observed before and after perihelion.</li>
    <li>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has identified a "ninth anomaly" related to the comet's behaviour.</li>
    <li>The comet turned bright blue instead of the expected red.</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide sublimation dominates at closer distances to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Potential for a "tenth anomaly" if non-gravitational acceleration occurs without significant mass loss.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29-30, 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, the point in its orbit closest to the Sun. Observations made before and after this event revealed several unexplained changes in the comet's behaviour, including an unexpected brightening and a shift in its colour.</p>
<p>Researchers have noted that the comet's brightening far exceeds that of typical Oort cloud comets at similar radial distances. The unusual characteristics have prompted further investigation into its internal makeup and potential changes from interstellar travel.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reason for 3I’s rapid brightening, which far exceeds the brightening rate of most Oort cloud comets at similar r [radial distance], remains unclear,” said researchers Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, then the non-gravitational acceleration must have resulted from it losing at least 15% of its mass,” noted Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS is unprecedented among known comets, particularly its bright blue appearance and the dominance of carbon dioxide sublimation. Such anomalies raise questions about the comet's origin and the effects of its journey through interstellar space.</p>
<p>Prior studies of comets typically do not report similar behaviours, making 3I/ATLAS a subject of intense interest in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for further anomalies, especially as it re-enters view. The potential for significant mass loss and the implications of non-gravitational acceleration remain key areas of focus for ongoing investigations.</p>
