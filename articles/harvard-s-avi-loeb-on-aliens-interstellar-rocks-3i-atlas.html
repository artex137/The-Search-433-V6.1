      <h2>Harvard's Avi Loeb on 3I/ATLAS and Its Potential Extraterrestrial Origins</h2>

<p>An interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS has been identified, raising questions about its origins and nature. The object was spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Simonyi Survey Telescope at the Rubin Observatory in Chile. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested it may not be a comet but potentially a piece of technology from an intelligent alien civilization.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about the formation of large celestial bodies. Authorities, including astronomers and scientists worldwide, are examining 3I/ATLAS closely to determine its true nature and implications for our understanding of the cosmos.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of Discovery: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Rubin Observatory, Chile</li>
    <li>Estimated Size: Up to 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) wide</li>
    <li>Previous Interstellar Objects: 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li>Current Classification: 4 on the Loeb Scale (0 being definitely natural)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Simonyi Survey Telescope. Following its discovery, scientists, including Loeb, began analyzing its characteristics, which differ significantly from typical comets.</p>
<p>Loeb has argued that the object’s size, brightness, and trajectory suggest it may not have formed naturally. Observations in late August indicated the presence of water, cyanide, and carbon dioxide, elements commonly found in comets, but Loeb maintains that the possibility of it being artificial warrants further investigation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Something is really unusual about it – it’s either much smaller or much rarer,” said Loeb regarding the formation of such a large object.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If this was a fine-tuned trajectory that was designed by some intelligence, that would make a lot of sense,” Loeb added, discussing the object’s path through the solar system.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected by humanity, following 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The discovery of interstellar objects challenges the existing understanding of celestial formations and raises questions about the potential for extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Loeb has developed the Loeb Scale to categorize interstellar objects, which currently places 3I/ATLAS at a level indicating it may not be a natural formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the inner solar system. Observations may clarify whether it is a comet or an artificial object. The scientific community is expected to engage in further debate and exploration of its origins.</p>
