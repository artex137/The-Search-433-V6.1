      <h2>Why Have We Never Sampled an Interstellar Comet?</h2>

<p>Scientists have identified a potential opportunity to sample the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first spotted in July 2023. A NASA space probe, the Europa Clipper, may come into contact with parts of the comet’s tail between October 30 and November 6, 2025, according to Samuel Grant, a researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it could yield the first sample of an interstellar object, which may provide valuable insights into the formation of star systems. Currently, there is limited data regarding the interiors of interstellar comets. Grant emphasized the importance of this mission, stating that comets serve as “time capsules” that hold material from their origins billions of years ago. However, challenges such as solar winds and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown may hinder the mission's success.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The Europa Clipper probe is expected to pass through the comet's ion tail between October 30 and November 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency are involved in the mission.</li>
    <li>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown may impact the probe's operations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, scientists first spotted the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, researchers have prepared for a potential encounter with the comet's ion tail. Between October 30 and November 6, 2025, the Europa Clipper is expected to fly through the comet's tail, which could allow for sampling of its material.</p>

<p>Samuel Grant and Geraint H. Jones have developed a computer program called Tailcatcher to predict such cosmic events. Although they are not part of the Europa Clipper team, their work could be instrumental in future sampling opportunities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have virtually no data on the interior of interstellar comets and the star systems that formed them,” said Samuel Grant, a postdoctoral researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Comets act as time capsules, holding onto material from their births billions of years ago,” Grant added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object discovered by scientists in the last decade. Astronomers believe that dozens of interstellar objects pass through the solar system, with around eight potentially becoming permanent residents. This highlights the importance of sampling such objects to gain a better understanding of their origins and the early solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will monitor the Europa Clipper's approach to 3I/ATLAS and assess the impact of the U.S. government shutdown on the mission. The European Space Agency's Comet Interceptor mission, set to launch in 2029, will further prioritize the investigation of interstellar comets.</p>
