      <h2>NASA activates defense protocol against comet 3I/ATLAS with unstable trajectory</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense protocol in response to detected variations in the trajectory and brightness of comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to this activation.</p>

<p>This activation is significant as it demonstrates NASA's commitment to monitoring and responding to potential threats from space. The agency is collaborating with the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) and the Minor Planet Center at Harvard to coordinate global observations. Although there is currently no immediate risk to Earth, NASA plans to conduct training campaigns in the coming months to prepare for any possible challenges.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is expected on October 30, 2025, near Mars’ orbit.</li>
    <li>Speed exceeds 210,000 km/h, confirming its extrasolar origin.</li>
    <li>Variations in brightness and position have been noted, complicating tracking efforts.</li>
    <li>The comet's core diameter ranges between 320 meters and 5.6 km.</li>
    <li>Global observation campaigns run from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. NASA detected variations in its trajectory and brightness, leading to the activation of the planetary defense protocol. The comet is expected to reach perihelion on October 30, 2025, close to Mars’ orbit. Observations from the Hubble and James Webb Telescopes have recorded an anti-solar tail, and data from the James Webb has revealed a coma rich in carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>In response to the challenges in tracking the comet, international observatories are participating in simulations to standardize data. A workshop scheduled for November 10, 2025, will bring together technicians to discuss adaptations to hyperbolic trajectories.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This activation is an opportunity for NASA to study interstellar materials and refine our models of external planetary formation,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov as the third interstellar object recorded. Previous incidents have highlighted the importance of international cooperation in tracking and responding to potential space threats.</p>

<p>The data and experiences gained from this mission will contribute to improving rapid response systems and furthering astrometry partnerships.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS closely, with a focus on refining tracking algorithms and preparing for potential orbital deviations. The upcoming global observation campaign will aid in testing responses to any unpredictable changes in the comet's trajectory.</p>
