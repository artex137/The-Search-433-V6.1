      <h2>Two Comets Will Streak Across the Sky in October</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS and Comet Lemmon (C/2025 A6) will be visible in the Northern Hemisphere in October 2025. Comet Lemmon is expected to reach peak brightness on or around October 21, while Comet SWAN (C/2025 R2) will be closest to Earth on October 19, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>This event is significant for skywatchers and astronomy enthusiasts. The visibility of these comets offers a unique opportunity to observe celestial phenomena that may not occur again for centuries. Authorities, including NASA, are actively monitoring these comets as they travel through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Lemmon:</strong> Expected peak brightness around October 21, 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>Comet SWAN:</strong> Closest approach to Earth on October 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet Lemmon was discovered in January 2025 by the Mount Lemmon Survey.</li>
    <li>Comet SWAN was discovered in September 2025 by an amateur astronomer.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently being observed by NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In January 2025, Comet Lemmon was first spotted by the Mount Lemmon Survey. In September 2025, Comet SWAN was discovered through analysis of NASA satellite data. As of mid-October 2025, Comet Lemmon has been visible in the pre-dawn sky near Ursa Major, transitioning to evening visibility later in the month. Comet SWAN has been best viewed approximately 90 minutes after sunset.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet Lemmon is expected to be visible to the naked eye, making it a great opportunity for the public to observe a comet,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are often studied for their unique characteristics and behaviors. Comet 3I/ATLAS has generated interest due to its unusual properties, leading to speculation about its origin. The observation of these comets contributes to ongoing research in astronomy and understanding of the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to prepare for viewing opportunities throughout October. Astronomers will continue to monitor all three comets for updates on their trajectories and visibility.</p>
