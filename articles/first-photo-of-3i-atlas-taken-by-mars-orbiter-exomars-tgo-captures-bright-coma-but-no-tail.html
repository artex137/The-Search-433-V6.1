      <h2>First photo of 3I/Atlas taken by Mars orbiter: ExoMars (TGO) captures bright coma but no tail</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has released the first photo of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, captured by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) at a distance of 30 million kilometres from Mars. The image shows a bright, white object tumbling through space, but it does not display a cometary tail.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insights into the characteristics of 3I/Atlas, which has been a subject of interest since its discovery on July 1. ESA continues to process additional images from the Mars Express spacecraft, which may yield further information about the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Photo taken by ExoMars TGO between October 1 and 7.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is located approximately 30 million km from Mars.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of the comet is about 1 km wide.</li>
    <li>The coma is several thousand kilometres across.</li>
    <li>Previous observations indicated the nucleus size.</li>
    <li>Images taken with an exposure time of 0.5 seconds for Mars Express.</li>
    <li>Nick Thomas is the Principal Investigator of the CaSSIS camera.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1. The ExoMars TGO captured images of the comet between October 1 and 7, 2023. The ESA has indicated that images from the Mars Express spacecraft are still being processed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This dot is the centre of the comet, comprising its icy-rocky nucleus and its surrounding coma,” ESA stated regarding the image captured by TGO.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nick Thomas noted, “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>ESA explained, “We can’t see the tail in the CaSSIS images, but it may become more visible in future observations as the comet continues to heat up and release more ice.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is an interstellar comet that has intrigued scientists since its discovery. The absence of a visible tail in the recent images may lead to further discussions about the comet's characteristics and behavior as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA is processing additional images from Mars Express, which may provide more data about 3I/Atlas and its features in the coming weeks.</p>
