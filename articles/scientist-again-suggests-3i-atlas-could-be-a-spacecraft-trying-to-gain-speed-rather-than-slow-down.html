      <h2>Scientist again suggests 3I/ATLAS could be a spacecraft trying 'to gain speed rather than slow down'</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be a spacecraft attempting to gain speed rather than slow down as it approaches the Sun. This claim follows a series of observations made between November 8 and November 9, 2023, by various astronomers at multiple locations.</p>

<p>This assertion is significant as it challenges the prevailing view among astronomers that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet. Authorities and scientists are now examining the comet's unusual behaviour and the implications of Loeb's theory regarding its composition and structure.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS displayed a "complex tail structure" on November 8, 2023.</li>
    <li>On November 9, 2023, it was observed with "nice tail structures," including an "antitail."</li>
    <li>Images were captured by M. Jäger, G. Rhemann, E. Prosperi, Michael Buechner, and Frank Niebling.</li>
    <li>David Jewitt and Jane Luu observed the comet on the Nordic Optical Telescope.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has highlighted anomalies in the comet's behaviour and structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 8, 2023, astronomers captured images of 3I/ATLAS showing a complex tail structure. The next day, further observations revealed additional tail features, including an antitail. Loeb commented on these findings, suggesting that the comet's behaviour could indicate it is not a typical comet but rather a spacecraft.</p>

<p>Loeb's theory posits that the anti-tail suggests the object is using gravitational assist from the Sun to accelerate, which is contrary to expected behaviour for a natural comet. He has called on other scientists to explain the anomalies he has identified.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Given the large-scale jets reported recently, the fact that 3I/ATLAS remains a single body is surprising for a natural comet."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb added, "This post-perihelion manoeuvre might be employed by a spacecraft that aims to gain speed rather than slow down through the gravitational assist from the Sun."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The previous observations of interstellar objects have typically classified them as natural celestial bodies. However, 3I/ATLAS has exhibited behaviour that has led some scientists, like Loeb, to propose alternative explanations. This ongoing debate highlights the complexities of studying interstellar phenomena and the need for further investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and gather more data to understand its nature and behaviour. The scientific community is expected to engage in discussions regarding Loeb's claims and the implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
