      <h2>Track 3I/ATLAS in Real Time Using NASA's Interactive 'Eyes on the Solar System' App</h2>

<p>NASA has integrated interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS into its interactive Eyes on the Solar System app, allowing users to track the comet's real-time trajectory, speed, and distance. This update is available to anyone with an internet connection and follows the comet's perihelion on 30 October 2025.</p>

<p>The integration of 3I/ATLAS into the app marks a significant development in public engagement with astronomy. As only the third confirmed interstellar visitor, 3I/ATLAS joins 'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019) in capturing global interest. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) provides live data, making the comet's journey accessible for educational and scientific purposes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on 30 October 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is officially designated as C/2025 N1.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in the solar system.</li>
    <li>The app uses live data from NASA's JPL and the Minor Planet Centre (MPC).</li>
    <li>Users can simulate the comet's close approach to Mars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii. After its discovery, the comet continued to gain attention as it approached the Sun, reaching perihelion on 30 October 2025. Since then, it has been moving outward on a hyperbolic escape path, gradually dimming from view.</p>
<p>NASA has updated its Eyes on the Solar System app to include 3I/ATLAS, allowing users to track its journey in real time. The app has seen increased engagement, with thousands of users sharing their experiences on social media.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Tracking interstellar comets helps astronomers compare their composition and behaviour with comets formed around the Sun,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This sheds light on whether the processes that shaped our solar system are universal.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Real-time public access is a powerful educational and scientific tool,” the spokesperson added. “We hope to inspire curiosity and participation in astronomy.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides a unique opportunity to study the characteristics of interstellar objects. Prior to this, only two other interstellar bodies have been confirmed in our solar system, making 3I/ATLAS an important subject for research. The integration of such objects into public platforms aligns with NASA's goals for transparency and engagement in deep-space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey into interstellar space, NASA plans to maintain real-time tracking through its app. The agency aims to further engage users and enhance educational resources related to astronomy.</p>
