      <h2>Congress Holds Hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena</h2>
<p>On September 9, 2025, the House Government Oversight subcommittee convened a hearing in Washington, D.C., to discuss recent sightings of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), commonly referred to as UFOs. The hearing featured four eyewitnesses, including three Armed Forces veterans and an investigative journalist, who shared their experiences with UAPs and the repercussions faced in their military careers.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it marks the third Congressional session on UAPs since July 2023, when public interest in the subject was reignited. Authorities are examining the implications of these phenomena on international security and advancements in weapons technology. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) investigates UAP sightings, though many older incidents remain unexplained, according to reports.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Capitol Building, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Four individuals, including three veterans and one journalist</li>
    <li>Established Task Force: “Declassification of Federal Secrets” created in February 2025</li>
    <li>Previous Hearings: Two prior sessions held in July 2023 and November 2024</li>
    <li>Investigative Office: All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) at the Pentagon</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, a witness testimony renewed public interest in UAPs, prompting Congressional hearings. A second hearing took place in November 2024, followed by the latest session on September 9, 2025. During the recent hearing, various witnesses discussed their experiences and the reluctance within the military to report UAPs due to fear of professional repercussions.</p>

<p>Representative Eric Burlison presented a video showing an unidentified object being targeted by a Hellfire missile, which appeared to have no effect on the target. Burlison acknowledged the possibility of explanations such as AI manipulation or the object being a balloon, but he expressed concern about a lack of transparency in Congress.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The public has a right to transparency,” said George Knapp, an investigative journalist. “Some in leadership believe the public is unable to ‘handle’ the truth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Representative Eric Burlison stated, “I have routinely been stonewalled in my attempts to get answers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has established the AARO to investigate UAP sightings by military personnel. While some incidents have been declassified, many older reports remain unexplained. There is no current evidence linking these phenomena to extra-terrestrial interference, and officials cite a lack of technology to analyze historical incidents.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress will continue to investigate UAP sightings and the implications for national security. Further hearings may be scheduled to ensure transparency and address the concerns raised by witnesses during the recent session.</p>
