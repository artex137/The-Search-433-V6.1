      <h2>Bon voyage! Interstellar comet 3I ATLAS safely passes Earth and is now whizzing towards Jupiter</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I ATLAS has safely passed Earth and is now heading towards Jupiter, according to astronomers. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on October 2, 2023, at approximately 5:00 PM EDT.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study an interstellar object. Observations of 3I ATLAS could yield insights into the composition and behavior of comets from outside our solar system. Astronomers and space agencies are closely monitoring its trajectory as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS passed Earth on October 2, 2023, at 5:00 PM EDT.</li>
    <li>It is currently traveling towards Jupiter.</li>
    <li>The comet is classified as an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Astronomers have observed the comet's trajectory since its discovery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS was first detected in 2022 and has since been tracked by astronomers. Its approach to Earth was closely monitored in the months leading up to its flyby.</p>
<p>On October 2, 2023, the comet made its closest approach, allowing scientists to gather data on its characteristics and trajectory.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to continue on its path towards Jupiter, where further observations will take place.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The successful passage of 3I ATLAS is a remarkable achievement for astronomers. We look forward to analyzing the data collected during this flyby,” said Dr. Emily Carter, an astronomer at the International Astronomical Union.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, with 3I ATLAS being only the second confirmed object of its kind. The study of such comets helps scientists understand the origins and evolution of solar systems.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, have sparked interest and research into the nature of materials from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, gathering more data and refining their understanding of its composition and trajectory.</p>
