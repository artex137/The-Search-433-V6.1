      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Update (Dec. 12, 2025): First X‑Ray View, Green Glow, and How to Spot the Interstellar Visitor</h2>

<p>On December 12, 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has made headlines due to a newly released X-ray view from ESA’s XMM-Newton and fresh images from the Gemini North telescope showing a notable green glow. The comet is approaching its closest distance to Earth on December 19, at approximately 270 million kilometers away, posing no threat to the planet.</p>

<p>Scientists have observed significant changes in 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. ESA has released an X-ray image showing the comet glowing in low-energy X-rays, while Gemini North's images indicate a shift in its coma's color. These findings enhance our understanding of the comet's composition and behavior, which is valuable for ongoing studies of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at about 1.8 astronomical units (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>X-ray observations by ESA’s XMM-Newton occurred on December 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Gemini North images were taken on November 26, 2025</li>
    <li>Comet speed: approximately 246,000 km/h at perihelion</li>
    <li>Comet nucleus diameter: estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, coming close to the Sun at about 1.4 astronomical units. Following this, the comet was observed by ESA’s XMM-Newton on December 3, 2025, for approximately 20 hours at a distance of 282–285 million kilometers. The Gemini North telescope captured new images on November 26, revealing a greenish glow around the comet.</p>
<p>The comet is set to reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. NASA has stated that at this time, it will be more than 700 times farther than the Moon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The glow observed in the X-ray image is expected as gas streaming off the comet interacts with the solar wind,” said an ESA spokesperson. “This phenomenon allows us to detect gases that are difficult to measure using other instruments.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike these predecessors, 3I/ATLAS is currently accessible for study, allowing researchers to investigate its unique composition and behavior. Previous studies of interstellar objects have raised questions about their origins and materials, which 3I/ATLAS may help clarify.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its behavior and emissions. Observers are encouraged to use telescopes or binoculars to spot the comet, particularly in the pre-dawn hours around December 19. Further analysis of the data collected from both X-ray and optical observations will contribute to ongoing research into the characteristics of interstellar comets.</p>
