This announcement could lead to significant market volatility, according to a former employee who has urged the bank to prepare for such an eventuality.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises concerns about potential economic impacts. Douglas Macgregor, a former senior analyst in financial security at the Bank of England, relayed the warning from Helen McCaw, who has advised the bank to "organize contingencies" in light of the anticipated announcement.
