      <h2>Harvard scientist believes alien 3I/Atlas could have been sent to ‘seed’ life on Earth</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has proposed that the interstellar object 3I/Atlas, currently traveling through our Solar System, may have non-natural origins that suggest it could be a vessel sent to seed life on Earth. This theory has sparked significant interest and debate within the scientific community since the object was first observed. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to 3I/Atlas.</p>

<p>The implications of Dr. Loeb's theory are profound, as it raises questions about the potential for extraterrestrial life and its influence on Earth. NASA officials, however, have dismissed the notion that 3I/Atlas is anything other than a typical comet. Their Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya stated that it is not a "spaceship." This disagreement highlights a divide in the scientific community regarding the interpretation of the object's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Proposed by: Dr. Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li>NASA Position: 3I/Atlas is a typical comet</li>
    <li>Date of NASA Press Conference: Last month</li>
    <li>Elon Musk's Comments: Suggested 3I/Atlas could be alien and pose a threat to Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first identified as an interstellar object, leading to various theories about its origins. In a recent press conference, Dr. Loeb presented his views, suggesting it could be an artificial construct sent by advanced life forms. NASA responded with their own assessment, labeling it a standard comet, which Dr. Loeb has contested.</p>

<p>Amateur astronomers have captured footage of 3I/Atlas, showing it rotating. This observation adds to the ongoing discussions about its nature. Elon Musk has also weighed in, warning that 3I/Atlas might have the potential to cause catastrophic damage to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “NASA’s representatives should have emphasised what we do not understand about 3I/ATLAS rather than insist that it is a familiar comet from a new birth environment,” Dr. Loeb stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We should not ‘judge a book by its cover,’ because we all know about the Trojan Horse which appeared unthreatening to the guardians of the City of Troy,” Dr. Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community has seen previous instances of debate surrounding interstellar objects, particularly following the discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017. This has prompted discussions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the need for rigorous investigation of non-standard astronomical phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its journey through the Solar System, scientists will monitor its trajectory and characteristics closely. Further studies and observations are expected to clarify its origins and potential implications for life on Earth.</p>
