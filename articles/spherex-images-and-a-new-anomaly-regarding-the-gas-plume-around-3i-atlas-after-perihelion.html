      <h2>SPHEREx Images and a New Anomaly Regarding the Gas Plume Around 3I/ATLAS After Perihelion</h2>

<p>Researchers have observed new anomalies related to the gas plume of comet 3I/ATLAS following its perihelion, according to findings from the SPHEREx project. The observations were made shortly after the comet's closest approach to the Sun, which occurred on May 31, 2023.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may provide insights into the composition and behavior of the comet, which has attracted attention from astronomers worldwide. The SPHEREx project is dedicated to mapping the entire sky in infrared light, and these findings contribute to broader studies of cometary phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on May 31, 2023.</li>
    <li>Observations were made by the SPHEREx project.</li>
    <li>The anomalies pertain to the gas plume emitted by the comet.</li>
    <li>Details on the specific composition of the gas plume are not disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 31, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, marking its closest approach to the Sun. Following this event, researchers utilized SPHEREx images to analyze changes in the comet's gas plume.</p>

<p>The findings reveal new anomalies, though specific details about these changes have not been disclosed. The analysis continues as scientists work to understand the implications of these observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anomalies observed in the gas plume of comet 3I/ATLAS could reveal important information about its composition and behavior,” said a representative from the SPHEREx project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been a subject of interest since its discovery due to its unique characteristics and behavior. The SPHEREx project aims to enhance our understanding of comets and their role in the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the gas plume anomalies and plan further observations to gather more data on comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system.</p>
