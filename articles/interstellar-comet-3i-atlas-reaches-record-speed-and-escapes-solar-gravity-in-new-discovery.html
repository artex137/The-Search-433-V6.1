      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas reaches record speed and escapes solar gravity in new discovery</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/Atlas has been confirmed to pass through the Solar System at a speed of 57 km/s, according to the global scientific community. This event, which marks a significant milestone in astronomical studies, occurs as the comet travels through the Solar System, challenging the gravitational pull of the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it highlights the capabilities of current space tracking technology. Authorities are now monitoring the trajectory of 3I/Atlas, which follows a hyperbolic curve indicative of objects that do not originate from our planetary system. The comet's high speed also sets new parameters for future studies of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Speed of 3I/Atlas: 57 km/s</li>
    <li>Speed of comet Borisov: 33 km/s</li>
    <li>Speed of object ‘Oumuamua: 26 km/s</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object officially identified</li>
    <li>Detection occurred in 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been observed as it approaches the Sun, with its trajectory confirming it will not be captured by solar gravity. The object is expected to reach its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, before continuing its journey back into deep space. Scientists are currently conducting spectroscopic analyses to understand its chemical composition.</p>

<p>As it travels, computer models have indicated that if a collision were to occur with the Sun, the object would accelerate to over 600 km/s, ultimately disintegrating due to extreme temperatures. However, no such collision is anticipated.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The interaction of 3I/Atlas with the Sun demonstrates the limits of our star’s gravitational influence on hypervelocity bodies,” said a spokesperson from the astronomical observatory monitoring the object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The passage of 3I/Atlas follows the discoveries of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet Borisov, both of which have contributed to the understanding of interstellar objects. These previous findings have prompted further investigation into the origins and characteristics of such celestial bodies, which are believed to have been expelled from their original systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to collect data on 3I/Atlas during its brief observation window in 2026. This information is critical for refining future detection models for interstellar visitors.</p>
