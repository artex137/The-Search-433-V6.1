      <h2>New Episode of ‘Highway to Space’ Tackles the Truth Behind Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A new episode of <em>Highway to Space</em> has premiered, focusing on comet 3I/ATLAS, which has intrigued scientists and the public since its discovery in December 2025. The episode features a discussion led by host Dan Profir and Dr Mirel Bîrlan from the Paris Observatory, aiming to clarify facts amid widespread misinformation surrounding the comet.</p>

<p>This episode is significant as it addresses the misconceptions about 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. Authorities emphasize the importance of distinguishing scientific facts from speculative claims, particularly those suggesting alien technology. The discussion also highlights the ongoing research efforts and upcoming space missions that may further our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered, marking it as the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Since then, it has generated significant public interest and speculation. In October 2023, the new episode of <em>Highway to Space</em> was released to address these topics.</p>

<p>The episode features a detailed discussion on the comet's hyperbolic trajectory, its high velocity, and its composition as revealed through spectroscopy. This conversation aims to separate fact from fiction, particularly regarding unfounded claims about alien technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is essential to maintain scientific caution when extraordinary narratives spread faster than facts,” said Dr Mirel Bîrlan during the episode.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The episode places comet 3I/ATLAS within the broader context of space science and exploration. It references the ESA’s Comet Interceptor mission, which aims to study future interstellar visitors. This reflects ongoing efforts to deepen our understanding of celestial phenomena and the importance of reliable science communication.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Asgardia encourages viewers to engage with the content and share the episode to promote informed discussions about space exploration and the significance of comets like 3I/ATLAS.</p>
