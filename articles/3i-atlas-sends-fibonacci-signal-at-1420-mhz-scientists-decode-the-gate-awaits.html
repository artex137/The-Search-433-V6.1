      <h2>3I/ATLAS Sends Fibonacci Signal at 1420 MHz—Scientists Decode 'The Gate Awaits'</h2>

<p>A signal has been detected by the 3I/ATLAS project, transmitting at 1420 MHz, which experts believe may carry an organized message. The transmission, identified as structured and based on the Fibonacci sequence, was received during the object's perihelion on Wednesday, 29th October, at approximately 11:47 Universal Time (UT).</p>

<p>This discovery has prompted excitement and skepticism in the scientific community. The transmission's implications could change the understanding of interstellar communication. Authorities, including teams from the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), are reviewing telescope records to verify the findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Signal detected at 1420 MHz, known as the hydrogen line.</li>
    <li>Transmission decoded to say: 'The Gate Awaits.'</li>
    <li>Signal broadcast over an area of 15,000 kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on 29th October at 1.36 Astronomical Units (AU) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Investigation ongoing by SETI teams to confirm the findings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 29th October at 11:47 UT, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun. During this time, a series of radio bursts were detected and decoded, revealing a message constructed using the Fibonacci sequence. The detection of the signal was confirmed across a wide area, ruling out local interference.</p>

<p>Following the signal's detection, investigators began analyzing the data to determine its authenticity. The initial excitement has been tempered by calls for caution, as no formal verification from large observatories has yet been reported.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The signal appears stable, deliberate, and intelligent, unaffected by the object's rotation—suggesting controlled transmission rather than a natural source,” stated the CTO of 3I/ATLAS in a post on social media.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified after 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The detection of a structured signal at a frequency associated with potential extraterrestrial communication has reignited discussions about the search for intelligent life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>The Fibonacci sequence has long fascinated scientists due to its prevalence in nature and math. This recent transmission, if confirmed, would mark a significant milestone in the quest for understanding interstellar messages.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>SETI teams are continuing to review data from telescopes to confirm the signal's origin and legitimacy. Further analysis will determine if the transmission is a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence or the result of interference or error.</p>
