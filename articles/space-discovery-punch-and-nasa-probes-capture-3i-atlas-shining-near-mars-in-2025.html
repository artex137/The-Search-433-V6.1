      <h2>Space discovery: PUNCH and NASA probes capture 3I/ATLAS shining near Mars in 2025</h2>

<p>NASA’s PUNCH mission has captured significant images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its close passage to Mars in September and October 2025. The comet made its closest approach to the red planet on October 3, passing approximately 30 million kilometers away.</p>

<p>This discovery is important for planetary science as it provides a rare opportunity to study material from outside our solar system. A network of NASA and ESA probes has monitored the comet, contributing to a detailed understanding of its characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars occurred on October 3, 2025, at a distance of 30 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>PUNCH mission captured images from September 28 to October 10, 2025.</li>
    <li>Diameter of the comet's core estimated at about 1 kilometer.</li>
    <li>Comet's perihelion occurred on December 12, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Multiple missions, including Lucy and Psyche, contributed to the observation campaign.</li>
    <li>Global observation coordinated by the UN’s International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile detected the comet 3I/ATLAS. The PUNCH mission began capturing images of the comet between September 28 and October 10, 2025, as it approached Mars. The closest approach to Mars occurred on October 3, 2025. Following this, the comet's perihelion took place on December 12, 2025.</p>

<p>During this period, various probes, such as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and MAVEN, gathered crucial data. The MRO captured images showing the comet’s coma and tail, while MAVEN mapped the presence of hydrogen and hydroxyl in the coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The persistent luminosity of 3I/ATLAS, even under challenging conditions, suggests that it may have a more reflective surface or an exceptionally efficient dust ejection mechanism,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object recognized to enter the solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of such objects provides insights into the formation and evolution of planets and comets beyond our solar system. The ongoing observation of 3I/ATLAS allows scientists to compare it with other interstellar bodies previously studied.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Data collected during this observation campaign will inform future studies and help researchers model the evolution of comets in distant star systems. Scientists are expected to continue analyzing the findings to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
