      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Spacecraft Close Flyby SwRI Mission Explained</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has become a key focus in astronomy following its detection in July. This rare comet is only the third interstellar visitor observed in the Solar System, prompting a proposed mission by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) to gather data about its structure, composition, and origins.</p>

<p>The mission study aims to explore material formed around another star, offering insights into the formation of the Solar System. Scientists believe this mission could enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their significance in the broader context of planetary formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object detected:</strong> July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar objects:</strong> 1I/‘Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Mission study led by:</strong> Dr. Alan Stern, SwRI</li>
    <li><strong>Proposed mission name:</strong> Interstellar Comet Explorer (ICE)</li>
    <li><strong>Key observations:</strong> Comet's coma has high carbon dioxide to water ratio</li>
    <li><strong>Observatories involved:</strong> NASA’s Hubble, James Webb, SPHEREx, TESS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its detection in July, 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant scientific interest. SwRI proposed the Interstellar Comet Explorer mission to perform a flyby of the object. Dr. Alan Stern has led the mission study, emphasizing the potential for groundbreaking observations.</p>
<p>Advanced orbital simulations have shown that a high-speed flyby is feasible, allowing the spacecraft to collect detailed measurements without entering orbit. Key observations are expected to occur as the comet approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is within range of the designed mission, and the observations could be groundbreaking,” said project manager Matthew Freeman.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Mark Tapley, an orbital mechanics expert, stated that their analysis showed a low-energy trajectory was possible, using technology similar to that already flown by NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects are remnants from the formation of star systems. Studies indicate that approximately seven interstellar objects enter the inner Solar System annually, with many more passing within Neptune's orbit. The Vera Rubin Observatory is expected to increase the detection rate of such objects in the future.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The SwRI mission proposal will undergo further evaluation to determine its feasibility. Upcoming close approaches of 3I/ATLAS to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter may provide additional opportunities for observation by various spacecraft.</p>
