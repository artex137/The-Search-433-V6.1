      <h2>Massive interstellar object 3I/Atlas could be an alien craft, suggests Harvard astrophysicist</h2>

<p>A Harvard astrophysicist, Avi Loeb, has proposed that the interstellar object known as 3I/Atlas might be an artificial craft rather than a natural celestial body. This claim comes as the object, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope, approaches the solar system, raising questions about its unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>Loeb's assertion highlights the significance of 3I/Atlas, which is believed to be larger than Manhattan Island. He argues that its brightness indicates it is reflecting sunlight from a solid object, which contradicts typical comet or meteor attributes. NASA has classified the object as a comet, stating it will pass at least 1.6 astronomical units away from Earth, posing no threat.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Size: Bigger than Manhattan Island</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 1.6 astronomical units (about 150 million miles)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors: 1I/'Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope. It is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to pass through the solar system. The first two were significantly smaller, raising concerns from Loeb about the size discrepancy.</p>

<p>Loeb argues that the object’s size and lack of expected rocky material in interstellar space suggest it may not have formed naturally. He states that such a large object should occur only once every 10,000 years, making its presence highly unusual.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is illogical that the third object from interstellar space will be 100 times larger than the first two,” said Loeb in an interview with Fox 10 Phoenix.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“According to NASA, this is a comet. It will stay at least 1.6 astronomical units away from Earth and is not a threat,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas follows two previous interstellar objects, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which were both significantly smaller. The discovery of these objects has prompted increased interest in the study of interstellar bodies and their potential origins.</p>

<p>The lack of rocky material in interstellar space, as noted by Loeb, raises questions about the formation of such a large object. The scientific community continues to explore the implications of these findings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas approaches the sun, scientists will monitor its behavior closely. Loeb anticipates that the object may erupt as it nears the sun, potentially developing a cometary tail, although he notes that no tail has been observed so far.</p>
