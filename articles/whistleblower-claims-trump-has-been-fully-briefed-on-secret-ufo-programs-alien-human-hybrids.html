      <h2>Whistleblower Claims Trump Has Been Fully Briefed On Secret UFO Programs, Alien-Human Hybrids</h2>

<p>UFO whistleblower David Grusch has claimed that President Donald Trump has been fully briefed on secret UFO programs and the existence of various alien races on Earth. Grusch, a veteran of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), made these assertions during a recent interview.</p>

<p>This matter has drawn attention due to Grusch's background and his prior testimony before the House Oversight Committee regarding undisclosed black programs within the U.S. government. Grusch alleges that these programs have been involved in unauthorized technological research related to UFOs and that he possesses knowledge of a spacecraft held by the government.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>David Grusch served 14 years in the Air Force and has worked in intelligence for several years.</li>
    <li>In 2024, Grusch testified before the House Oversight Committee about secret government programs.</li>
    <li>Grusch claims to have shared information with the FBI, CIA, and Department of Homeland Security during a secret meeting in New York City.</li>
    <li>He asserts that Trump has received reports on crashed spacecraft and non-human remains.</li>
    <li>Grusch claims that one alien race has been crossbreeding with humans.</li>
    <li>Congressman Eric Burlison has supported Grusch's claims, discussing the concept of "Nordic aliens."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>David Grusch has made public claims regarding UFOs and aliens in several key instances:</p>
<ul>
    <li>2024: Grusch testifies before the House Oversight Committee about secret black programs.</li>
    <li>Recent: Grusch shares claims in an interview with Fox News about Trump being briefed on UFOs and alien races.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Members of this current administration are very well aware of this reality. Certainly, the current president is very knowledgeable on this subject,” David Grusch said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Congressman Eric Burlison stated, “Nordic aliens are like a few hundred years more advanced than we are, but they’re not super advanced.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Grusch's claims come amid a growing public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and government transparency regarding UFOs. Several former officials have corroborated the existence of UFO-related research within the U.S. government, prompting calls for more disclosure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into Grusch's claims and the broader implications of UFO programs may continue as more individuals come forward with similar allegations. Further congressional hearings could also be on the horizon as interest in the topic persists.</p>
