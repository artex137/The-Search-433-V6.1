      <h2>3I/ATLAS Nears Earth—Experts Claim Comet Is A Window To Galaxy's Past</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS is currently travelling through space, sitting at a distance of more than 300 million kilometres from Earth as it approaches the planet. This interstellar object is the third confirmed interstellar comet, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Astronomers and stargazers worldwide are closely monitoring its path as it offers a unique glimpse into the early days of the galaxy.</p>

<p>The scientific community is actively observing 3I/ATLAS, utilising advanced technology to capture images and data. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have deployed multiple spacecraft to track the comet. This rare opportunity to study a cosmic relic has generated significant interest among scientists and amateurs alike.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Over 300 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> 269 million kilometres on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 210,000 kilometres per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Size:</strong> Between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres wide</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Efforts:</strong> Involves NASA and ESA spacecraft, including the James Webb Space Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has captured global attention since its discovery. Notable events include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>October 2-3, 2023:</strong> NASA spacecraft, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN, captured images of the comet from approximately 29 million kilometres from Mars.</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-December 2025:</strong> The comet will make its closest approach to Earth, allowing for detailed observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Everyone who has a telescope wants to look at it because it's a very rare chance.” — Shawn Domagal-Goldman, NASA's acting astrophysics director</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The space agency is always searching for signs of life, but 3I/ATLAS is a comet.” — Amit Kshatriya, NASA</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Thinking about this gives me goosebumps.” — Tom Statler, NASA scientist</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides insights into the formation of our galaxy. Unlike typical comets that originate from the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud, this object is an interstellar visitor, believed to have formed in a star system that is between 5 and 10 billion years old. This offers a unique opportunity to study the universe's early chemical composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will maintain close observation of the comet. The findings from ESA's Juice spacecraft will arrive in February, providing additional data on this rare cosmic encounter.</p>
