      <h2>The UN is closely watching alien comet 3I/ATLAS. Here's why.</h2>

<p>The United Nations has begun monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS, a celestial object that has drawn attention due to its unique characteristics. The comet was first identified in 2019 and is currently on a trajectory that will bring it near Earth in the coming months.</p>

<p>This monitoring is significant as authorities aim to understand the potential implications of the comet's path and composition. The UN has established a dedicated team to assess any potential risks it may pose to Earth and to collaborate with space agencies globally.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2019.</li>
    <li>It is classified as an interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>The UN has formed a team to monitor the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to come close to Earth in the coming months.</li>
    <li>Collaboration involves various global space agencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in December 2019. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory and characteristics. The UN's interest has grown as the comet approaches Earth, leading to the formation of a specialized monitoring team.</p>

<p>As the comet nears, discussions among international space agencies will likely intensify to share data and insights regarding its potential impact.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The monitoring of 3I/ATLAS is crucial for understanding interstellar objects and their effects on our planet,” said a UN spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects following the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. This has prompted scientists to enhance their predictive models and monitoring capabilities for celestial bodies that may pass through our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The UN and its global partners will continue to assess the comet's trajectory and prepare for any necessary actions as it approaches Earth. Further updates will be released as more data becomes available.</p>
