      <h2>Live From Italy: 3I/ATLAS Captured in Stunning Images — Astronomer Confirms 'Clearly a Comet'</h2>

<p>Astronomers in Italy have captured live images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, confirming that it is a comet rather than an artificial object. The 40-minute livestream, broadcast on 19 November by the Virtual Telescope Project from Manciano, drew global attention as viewers watched the comet's glowing nucleus, distinct coma, and faint dust tail.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provided clear visual evidence of the comet's characteristics, allowing the public to engage with a rare cosmic phenomenon. The livestream was led by Italian astrophysicist Gianluca Masi, who emphasized that the object's cometary nature has been understood since its discovery in July 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of livestream: 19 November 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li>Duration of livestream: 40 minutes</li>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on 1 July 2025. Astronomers quickly determined it was travelling on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not bound to the Sun. Following its recent emergence from behind the Sun's glare, the Virtual Telescope Project broadcast live images of the comet on 19 November 2023.</p>

<p>During the livestream, Masi addressed online speculation regarding the object's nature, confirming it is a comet and not a technological probe. He stated that the comet's characteristics have been clear since its discovery.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It is clearly a comet,” Masi said, dismissing speculation about the object being an artificial craft. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The cometary nature was pretty clear after it was discovered,” Masi added, expressing confusion over the persistence of alternative theories.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the interstellar object 'Oumuamua, which sparked similar speculation upon its discovery. Such objects provide valuable opportunities for scientific study, revealing material formed around other stars billions of years ago. No reputable scientific institution has suggested that 3I/ATLAS is artificial in nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away from the Sun, it will soon fade from view and leave the solar system for good. Researchers will continue to analyze its light spectrum to gather more data about its composition and origins.</p>
