      <h2>Newly Released Video Shows U.S. Reaper Drone Shooting at ‘UFO’</h2>

<p>A recent Congressional hearing has revealed video footage of a U.S. Reaper drone firing a Hellfire missile at an unidentified flying object (UFO) off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. The missile appeared to bounce off the object, which continued moving, according to Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Missouri), who shared the video during a House Oversight subcommittee meeting focused on UFO transparency.</p>

<p>This incident raises questions about potential military capabilities and the nature of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). The video has garnered significant attention from lawmakers and the public, prompting further investigation into the nature of the object and the circumstances surrounding the drone's engagement. The footage is currently under independent review, as stated by Burlison.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video footage shows a Reaper drone firing a missile at an unidentified object.</li>
    <li>The incident occurred on October 30, 2024, off the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>The video was shared during a House Oversight subcommittee meeting on UFO transparency.</li>
    <li>Rep. Eric Burlison has characterized the footage as being presented by a whistleblower.</li>
    <li>This is reportedly the first known instance of a Reaper drone engaging an aerial target in an operational setting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a Reaper drone tracked an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen, according to video footage shared by Rep. Eric Burlison. The drone was given the green light to engage, resulting in a Hellfire missile being fired at the object. The missile reportedly failed to affect the target, which continued its trajectory.</p>

<p>The video was publicly revealed during a House Oversight subcommittee meeting on UFO transparency, hosted by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna. This meeting aimed to discuss the implications of unidentified aerial phenomena and enhance public understanding of military engagements with such objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The footage is presented as received from a whistleblower. Independent review is ongoing." - Rep. Eric Burlison
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent video adds to a growing body of evidence regarding unidentified aerial phenomena, previously rebranded as UAPs. The U.S. government has shown increased interest in investigating and disclosing information about these sightings, with Rep. Luna leading efforts to declassify federal secrets related to UFOs. This ongoing dialogue reflects a shift in public and governmental attitudes towards unexplained aerial encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the video and the nature of the unidentified object are expected to continue, with further hearings likely as lawmakers seek to understand the implications of military engagements with UAPs.</p>
