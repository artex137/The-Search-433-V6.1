      <h2>10 rare discoveries and memorable moments from space in 2025</h2>

<p>In 2025, numerous significant events occurred in space exploration, including the discovery of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. This comet is only the third known object to enter the solar system from outside, and it passed closest to Earth at a distance of 267 million kilometres on December 19, 2025. There were no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>The discovery of comet 3I/ATLAS is important as it enhances scientific understanding of celestial bodies entering the solar system. NASA and other research agencies have monitored and studied the comet as it traversed through space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth was 267 million kilometres on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Detected by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Comet classified as the third known interstellar object</li>
    <li>No threat to Earth confirmed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Scientists quickly evaluated the comet, confirming that it posed no threat to Earth. The comet made its closest approach to our planet on December 19, 2025, passing at a distance of 267 million kilometres.</p>

<p>In early December, the Hubble Space Telescope captured detailed observations of the comet as it moved through the solar system, contributing to a greater understanding of its trajectory and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I/ATLAS expands our knowledge of interstellar objects and provides new data for ongoing research,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects had been confirmed: 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such objects offers insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it leaves the solar system, gathering data that could inform future missions and research on similar celestial bodies.</p>
