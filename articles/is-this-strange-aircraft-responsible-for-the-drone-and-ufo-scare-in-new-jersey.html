      <h2>Is this strange aircraft responsible for the drone and ‘UFO’ scare in New Jersey?</h2>

<p>A private contractor has claimed responsibility for the drone and "UFO" sightings in New Jersey last year during a demonstration at the Army’s UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August. An employee of the unnamed contractor reportedly indicated that their aircraft was in the air over New Jersey in November 2024 to test its capabilities, according to a source who attended the summit.</p>

<p>This revelation may clarify the cause of the numerous reports of unidentified flying objects across New Jersey from November to December 2024. Authorities, including President Trump’s Federal Aviation Administration, have previously stated that many of these sightings were attributed to hobbyists and recreational pilots. The claims from the contractor have prompted further scrutiny of the incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Demonstration occurred at Fort Rucker in August 2025.</li>
    <li>Contractor's aircraft is approximately 6 meters wide with four wings.</li>
    <li>Reported sightings began on November 13, 2024, over Picatinny Arsenal.</li>
    <li>Reports continued across New Jersey until early December 2024.</li>
    <li>All conference attendees were approved under strict participation rules.</li>
    <li>Fort Rucker is the headquarters for the Army’s Aviation Branch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 13, 2024, reports of drone sightings began over Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, New Jersey. The sightings continued throughout the state until early December 2024.</p>
<p>In August 2025, during the UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker, a contractor demonstrated a unique manned aerial craft. An employee of the contractor claimed that this aircraft was responsible for the UFO sightings in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The contractor's employee stated that their activities were not required to be disclosed to the public due to a private government contract.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” said an employee of the contractor, according to a source who attended the summit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It feels like it’s a UFO because it defies what you’re expecting to see,” the source, a military veteran and drone expert, said of the aircraft.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The rash of UFO sightings in New Jersey sparked considerable public interest and concern. The Federal Aviation Administration later identified many reports as originating from hobbyists and private individuals. However, the contractor's admission raises questions about the nature of these sightings and the role of military technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the reported sightings may continue as the claims from the contractor gain attention. Authorities are expected to review the circumstances surrounding the demonstrations and the subsequent sightings in New Jersey.</p>
