      <h2>'I know about Navy's horrifying UFO log books and terrifying things moving across our seas'</h2>

<p>A former submarine technician has claimed he learned about Navy logbooks that document mysterious high-speed unidentified objects traveling across the world's oceans. This disclosure follows a 2024 report revealing 21 unexplained UFO encounters, which the US government has acknowledged after Congress received the file from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as it raises questions about the nature of these unidentified objects and the Navy's tracking of them. The AARO has stated that it works closely with the Intelligence Community and Science and Technology partners to analyze these encounters, which merit further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Former submarine technician alleges disturbing Navy logbooks exist.</li>
    <li>2024 report disclosed 21 unexplained UFO encounters.</li>
    <li>US government acknowledged the findings after Congressional review.</li>
    <li>Reddit user "Dabier" reported insights from a retired Cold War submarine operator.</li>
    <li>AARO has found no evidence of extraterrestrial activity.</li>
    <li>Notable sightings include the 'GOFAST' video and a silver sphere recorded by a U.S. drone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2024, a report surfaced documenting 21 unexplained UFO encounters, prompting the US government to acknowledge its findings. The AARO provided this information to Congress, which included eyewitness testimonies and details of the encounters.</p>

<p>A Reddit user, known as Dabier, recounted a conversation with a retired submarine operator regarding "fast movers"—unidentified aerial or underwater objects detected by military equipment. The technician detailed how the Navy documented unidentified contacts in logbooks, often noting strange noises and rapid movements.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>AARO stated: "It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology."</blockquote>
<blockquote>AARO added: "None of these resolved cases substantiated advanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Mike Gold, former NASA Associate Administrator for Space Policy, cautioned the House of Representatives: "The truth is out there," urging NASA to enhance its tracking capabilities for suspected UFOs.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Reports of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), commonly referred to as UFOs, have increased in recent years, with various sightings capturing public attention. While some objects have been identified as ordinary items, others remain unexplained, contributing to ongoing investigations by military and intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>The infamous 'GOFAST' video, along with footage of a rapidly moving silver sphere, exemplifies the types of encounters that continue to puzzle authorities. The AARO is currently tasked with analyzing these cases and reporting any significant findings to Congress.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>AARO will continue its investigations into the 21 unexplained cases and provide immediate notification to Congress if any findings suggest a breakthrough in foreign adversarial aerospace capability.</p>
