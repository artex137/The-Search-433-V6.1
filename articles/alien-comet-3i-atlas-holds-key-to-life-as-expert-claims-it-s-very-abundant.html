      <h2>'Alien comet' 3I/ATLAS holds key to life as expert claims 'it's very abundant'</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July, is producing chemical compounds that may be linked to the origins of life, according to experts. NASA has stated that the comet poses no danger to Earth. However, its unusual characteristics have sparked ongoing discussions among scientists.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may provide insights into the building blocks of life. NASA astrochemist Dr. Martin Cordiner and his team at the Goddard Space Flight Centre have identified unusually high levels of hydrogen cyanide and methanol coming from 3I/ATLAS. These findings add to the ongoing research and discussions about the comet's implications for understanding life's origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Nasa has confirmed the comet poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Dr. Martin Cordiner's team identified high levels of hydrogen cyanide and methanol.</li>
    <li>The comet releases approximately 0.25 to 0.5 kg of hydrogen cyanide every second.</li>
    <li>It releases about 40 kg of methanol per second.</li>
    <li>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested the comet may not be naturally formed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered, marking its entry into our solar system. Since then, scientists have conducted studies to analyze its characteristics. Recently, Dr. Martin Cordiner and his team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre reported the detection of high levels of hydrogen cyanide and methanol, prompting discussions about the comet's chemical makeup and its implications for the origins of life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Molecules like hydrogen cyanide and methanol are at trace abundances and not the dominant constituents of our own comets,” said Dr. Cordiner. “In this alien comet, they’re very abundant.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It seems really chemically implausible that you could go on a path to very high chemical complexity without producing methanol,” added Cordiner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, “On a blind date with an interstellar visitor, it is prudent to observe the dating partner and decide whether it could have seeded life on Earth by carrying out interstellar panspermia or whether it represents a serial killer spreading poison.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS is relatively recent, with few such comets observed. Previous studies have focused on the chemical composition of comets within our solar system. The unusual findings in 3I/ATLAS may offer new perspectives on how life could potentially spread across the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS to further understand its chemical properties and implications for the origins of life. Authorities remain vigilant, but no immediate actions are expected as the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>
