      <h2>Donald Trump insiders claim President has bombshell UFO disclosure speech</h2>

<p>Reports have emerged indicating that President Donald Trump has prepared a speech to publicly disclose alleged evidence of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) spanning decades. The information comes from Mark Christopher Lee, a UK-based writer and self-proclaimed ufologist, who claims an advisor to the Trump administration has revealed the president has received approval from global leaders to make this announcement.</p>

<p>This disclosure matters because it could mark the first official acknowledgment of extraterrestrial life by a world leader. Authorities are reportedly preparing for this significant statement, with anticipation growing regarding its timing and content.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Speech has been prepared by President Donald Trump, according to Mark Christopher Lee.</li>
    <li>The address may reveal years of unexplained aerial phenomena and military eyewitness accounts.</li>
    <li>It was initially planned for the United Nations General Assembly in September but has been rescheduled for July 8.</li>
    <li>The speech is expected to reference significant UFO encounters, including the 2004 USS Nimitz sighting and the 2015 USS Theodore Roosevelt incidents.</li>
    <li>Lee claims the insider advising him is a successful business person involved in reviewing archival UFO material.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee claims that the speech was initially slated for the United Nations General Assembly in September. However, it has now been rescheduled to coincide with the 79th anniversary of the Roswell incident on July 8. Lee also suggests that Trump might announce details even earlier due to new intelligence developments.</p>
<p>Significant UFO encounters referenced in the anticipated speech include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>November 2004 USS Nimitz sighting.</li>
    <li>2015 USS Theodore Roosevelt GoFast and Gimbal events.</li>
    <li>1947 Roswell incident.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "He will confirm that forensic analysis of recovered off-world vehicles and non-human biologics has established their extraterrestrial origin," Mark Christopher Lee stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "He will emphasize that he is the first president to authorize full disclosure because the American people deserve transparency," Lee added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The anticipated speech follows a series of recent congressional testimonies regarding UFO encounters. The 2004 Nimitz sighting gained significant attention after former Navy fighter pilot David Fravor provided sworn testimony to Congress in 2023, recounting his experience with an unidentified object during a training mission.</p>
<p>The 2015 encounters on the USS Roosevelt, known as GoFast and Gimbal, were documented by aviators and radar technicians and later made public by the Pentagon.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the date for the potential announcement approaches, it remains unclear what specific actions the Trump administration will take. Investigations into past UFO encounters may continue, and further details about the speech are expected to emerge in the coming weeks.</p>
