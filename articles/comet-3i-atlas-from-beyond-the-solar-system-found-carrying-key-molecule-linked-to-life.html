      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS, from beyond the Solar System, found carrying key molecule linked to life</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed releasing high levels of methanol, a molecule essential to early prebiotic chemistry, according to a research team led by Martin Cordiner of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. The observations were made using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile as the comet approached the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because methanol has never been detected in an object arriving from outside our solar system. The findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS is chemically distinct from typical comets found in our solar system, providing insights into the comet's formation and the potential for prebiotic chemistry in other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar visitor.</li>
    <li>It is emitting hydrogen cyanide at rates between 250 and 500 grams per second.</li>
    <li>Methanol production is approximately 40 kilograms per second, accounting for about 8% of all vapour from the comet.</li>
    <li>Typical solar system comets produce only around 2% methanol.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma extends many kilometres from its nucleus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approached the sun, scientists detected a rapidly expanding cloud of water vapour and gas around the comet. Observations revealed an unusual surface composition, as indicated by the comet's noticeably redder light. The research team began their investigations using ALMA, focusing on the comet's chemistry and the presence of carbon-based molecules.</p>

<p>Notably, the comet began shedding gas while still far from the sun, suggesting it may have been isolated from other stars for hundreds of millions of years. This has led researchers to believe that the comet could provide valuable information regarding the conditions in its original star system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Hydrogen cyanide and methanol usually appear only in small traces in our own comets,” Cordiner said. “But in this interstellar object, they seem to be unusually abundant.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It’s very unlikely you can reach high chemical complexity without producing methanol along the way,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that metal-rich comets could generate large quantities of methanol through chemical reactions involving subsurface water and iron-bearing minerals. Josep Trigo-Rodríguez of the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain has contributed to these predictions, noting the importance of metal content in understanding comet composition.</p>

<p>The detection of methanol in 3I/ATLAS may indicate that the comet is rich in metals, providing further insights into its ancient origins and the conditions that may have existed in its original star system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gain a deeper understanding of its chemical makeup and implications for the origins of life in the universe. Further observations may reveal more about the comet’s structure and the processes at play in its formation.</p>
