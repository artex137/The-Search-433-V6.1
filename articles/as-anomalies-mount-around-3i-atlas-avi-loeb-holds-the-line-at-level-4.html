      <h2>As Anomalies Mount Around 3I/ATLAS, Avi Loeb Holds The Line At Level 4</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has maintained the classification of comet 3I/ATLAS at Level 4 on the Loeb Scale, despite the discovery of eighteen confirmed anomalies, as of now, in its behavior and composition. This decision comes amidst growing curiosity from the astronomical community about the object's unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>The classification of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it highlights the object’s departure from established cometary norms. Authorities and scientists continue to analyze data from various space-based observatories, including the Hubble Space Telescope and SPHEREx, to understand the implications of these anomalies better.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Current classification: Level 4 on the Loeb Scale.</li>
    <li>Number of confirmed anomalies: eighteen.</li>
    <li>Next close encounter with Jupiter: March 16, 2026, at approximately 53.445 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Statistical likelihood of its proximity to Jupiter: approximately 0.004 percent.</li>
    <li>Notable features: collimated sunward jet and unusual gas compositions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first confirmed as an interstellar visitor, setting itself apart from other celestial bodies. Initial reports identified twelve anomalies, which have since increased to eighteen through ongoing observations.</p>
<p>The object is expected to pass Jupiter on March 16, 2026, a close encounter that could yield further insights into its behavior and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The growing anomaly list has not yet triggered a reclassification to Level 5 on the Loeb Scale,” said Loeb, emphasizing the need for rigorous scientific standards.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's caution in classifying 3I/ATLAS stems from his previous work on interstellar objects like 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which received significant scrutiny for their potential artificial origins. The scientific community remains watchful as more data emerges regarding 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, with future observations expected to provide critical data that may influence its classification on the Loeb Scale.</p>
