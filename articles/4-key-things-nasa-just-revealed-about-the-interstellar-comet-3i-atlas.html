      <h2>NASA Reveals Key Findings About Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has provided new insights into interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a briefing on October 17, 2023, following its discovery on July 1. The comet is currently moving through our solar system, but there have been no injuries or fatalities associated with it.</p>

<p>The findings are significant as they clarify misconceptions surrounding the comet's nature. NASA officials have emphasized that 3I/ATLAS is a natural object, not an alien spacecraft, countering online speculation that gained traction during the recent government shutdown. The agency's analysis has involved over 20 missions, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of this unique celestial visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2023, by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass no closer than 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) to Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA has coordinated over 20 missions to observe the comet, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>Initial observations suggest the comet carries chemical clues from a planetary system older than our own.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to have a nucleus size between 427 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023. Following its discovery, a group of researchers raised concerns about the comet possibly being alien technology. This speculation intensified during the government shutdown, which prevented NASA from commenting on the object.</p>

<p>On October 17, NASA held a briefing to present its findings, confirming that 3I/ATLAS is a comet and poses no threat to Earth. The agency has utilized a fleet of spacecraft to gather data about the comet since its discovery, with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter capturing images in early October.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet," said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya during the briefing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "None of NASA's observations show any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet," added Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS marks only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. Previous speculation about such objects has often involved discussions about potential alien technology, particularly following the arrival of 'Oumuamua in 2017. This ongoing interest highlights humanity's quest for signs of life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the orbit of Jupiter in Spring 2026. The agency is expected to release further analyses and observations as more data is collected from various missions studying the comet.</p>
