      <h2>Extreme NiI/FeI Abundance Ratio In The Coma Of The Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Researchers have reported an unusual abundance ratio of nickel (NiI) to iron (FeI) in the coma of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, observed using the ESO Very Large Telescope. The findings were documented in a study submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics on September 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about the composition of cometary material and the processes involved in the formation of comets. The observations suggest that the production rates of NiI and FeI in comet 3I are higher than typically found in solar system comets, indicating unique characteristics of this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed at heliocentric distances ranging from 3.14 to 2.14 astronomical units (au).</li>
    <li>NiI was detected at all observation epochs; FeI was detected only at distances smaller than 2.64 au.</li>
    <li>The NiI/FeI abundance ratio is significantly higher than that of solar system comets.</li>
    <li>The study involved a team of researchers including Damien Hutsemékers and Emmanuël Jehin.</li>
    <li>The research was conducted using the UVES spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Observations of comet 3I/ATLAS have occurred at six different times, with the data collection spanning from a distance of 3.14 au to 2.14 au from the Sun. The study focused on detecting the emission lines of NiI and FeI and analyzing their relative abundance.</p>
<p>The research team compared the observed line intensities to a fluorescence model to estimate the production rates of these atoms. The findings indicate that 3I/ATLAS has a high production rate of NiI and a rapidly decreasing NiI/FeI ratio as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of these lines in cometary spectra is unexpected because the surface blackbody equilibrium temperature is too low to allow the sublimation of refractory minerals containing these metals,” the researchers stated in their report.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous research on interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, has shown similar NiI/FeI abundance ratios, but comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits an even higher ratio. This raises questions about the processes that govern the formation and evolution of comets from different stellar environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research team plans to continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun to further investigate the changes in its composition and behavior, particularly how the NiI/FeI ratio evolves.</p>
