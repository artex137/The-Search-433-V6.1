      <h2>Anomalous radio signals from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS put space agencies on high alert</h2>

<p>The international scientific community is on alert following the detection of anomalous radio signals from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. This discovery, made by a global network of radio telescopes, has prompted NASA and other space agencies to activate planetary surveillance protocols to monitor the comet as it crosses the solar system. The comet, identified as the third confirmed interstellar visitor, has exhibited behavior that does not align with known celestial body models.</p>

<p>The detection of these radio emissions, captured at specific frequencies, has generated extensive debate about their origin and nature, which remain a mystery. Given the unprecedented nature of the event, teams of astronomers and planetary defense specialists are mobilized worldwide to analyze the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and decipher the signals. Initial projections indicate a safe passage through Earth at the end of 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was officially identified on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The first detection of radio signals occurred on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Signals detected at 1.6 GHz band do not resemble natural cosmic noises.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) is leading the response.</li>
    <li>Comet's estimated diameter ranges from 320 meters to 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Collaboration includes the European Space Agency (ESA) and various observatories worldwide.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS astronomical survey system in Hawaii officially identified 3I/ATLAS. The comet was confirmed to have a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originated from outside the solar system.</p>

<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa captured the first anomalous radio signals from the comet. Subsequent observations confirmed the emissions, which exhibited a complex structure.</p>

<p>Following these events, NASA activated its planetary surveillance protocols, intensifying monitoring efforts of the comet and its radio emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The signals we have detected are not consistent with any known natural processes,” said a spokesperson from NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office. “We are mobilizing our resources to monitor this unprecedented event closely.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS challenges existing models regarding the density and distribution of interstellar objects in the galaxy. Previous interstellar visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have not exhibited similar behavior.</p>

<p>The detection of complex radio signals raises important questions about the formation of planetesimals in other stellar systems and the potential for new discoveries in interstellar dynamics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS around the clock, analyzing the data collected to refine the comet's orbit and assess any potential risks. Specific working groups have been established to focus on the signals and the comet's physical and chemical composition.</p>
