      <h2>Neil deGrasse Tyson discusses alarming space visitor</h2>

<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson has recently addressed the public fascination with comet 3I/ATLAS, a celestial body traveling through our solar system, during a discussion on October 28, 2025. The comet, discovered by a telescope in Chile, is expected to make its closest approach in the next six to seven weeks.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected entering our solar system, with an orbit not bound to our sun. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring the comet closely and have classified it as harmless, although discussions among scientists continue regarding its unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Designation:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Up to 20 kilometers in diameter</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 245,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Detected by ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Next closest approach:</strong> 6-7 weeks from October 28, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's classification:</strong> Harmless comet</li>
    <li><strong>Probability of close encounter:</strong> Less than 0.005 percent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2025, NASA identified 3I/ATLAS as a potential target for scientific study. The object was discovered using the ATLAS telescope system designed to locate near-Earth objects. On October 28, 2025, Neil deGrasse Tyson discussed the comet's properties and implications during a public event.</p>

<p>As it travels through the solar system, 3I/ATLAS will pass relatively close to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, providing opportunities for further observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“At NASA, our planetary defense teams watch the skies to safeguard our planet. Sometimes, our telescopes find amazing objects like comet 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This newcomer appears at least a thousand times more massive than earlier detected interstellar travelers,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects that have been detected, with previous visitors being significantly smaller. The classification of such objects allows scientists to better understand their origins and potential implications for the solar system.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb's theories about the object, including the possibility that it could be an extraterrestrial trojan horse, have sparked debate within the scientific community and raised public interest in the study of space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will have additional opportunities to observe the comet and gather more data about its composition and origins. Discussions regarding its unusual characteristics will likely continue among experts in the field.</p>
