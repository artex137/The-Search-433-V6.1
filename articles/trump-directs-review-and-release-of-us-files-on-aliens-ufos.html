      <h2>Trump directs review and release of US files on aliens, UFOs</h2>

<p>US President Donald Trump has announced plans to direct federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, to identify and release government files related to aliens and extraterrestrial life. This statement was made on Thursday while Trump was aboard Air Force One, following remarks made by former president Barack Obama regarding the existence of aliens.</p>

<p>This initiative aims to address public interest in the topic of extraterrestrial life and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Trump criticized Obama’s comments made during a podcast, stating that the former president should not have suggested that aliens are real.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of announcement: Thursday, not disclosed</li>
    <li>Involved agencies: Department of Defense, federal agencies</li>
    <li>Trump's comments made aboard Air Force One</li>
    <li>Obama's podcast interview released: Saturday, not disclosed</li>
    <li>Pentagon's 2024 report: “no evidence” of alien life</li>
    <li>2023 US House of Representatives panel on UFOs: no confirmation of alien life</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Saturday, former president Barack Obama appeared on a podcast hosted by Brian Tyler Cohen, where he stated, “Aliens are real.” He later clarified that he had not seen any evidence of contact with extraterrestrial life during his presidency. Trump responded to these remarks on Thursday, stating his intention to release government files on the subject.</p>

<p>In his announcement on Truth Social, Trump noted the “tremendous interest” in the topic and emphasized the importance of the information to the public. He included references to UAP and UFOs in his directive.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He's not supposed to be doing that. He made a big mistake,” Trump told reporters regarding Obama's comments.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Obama clarified in a post on Instagram.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This announcement follows a 2024 report from the Pentagon, which stated there was “no evidence” that the US government had encountered alien life. Most unidentified sightings were attributed to ordinary objects. Additionally, a panel held by the US House of Representatives in 2023 on unidentified anomalous phenomena did not confirm the existence of alien life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The federal agencies are expected to begin the review and release of the files related to aliens and UFOs, although specific timelines for this process have not been disclosed.</p>
