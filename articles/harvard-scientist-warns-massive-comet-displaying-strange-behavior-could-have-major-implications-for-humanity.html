      <h2>Harvard scientist warns 'massive' comet displaying 'strange behavior' could have 'major implications for humanity'</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has expressed concern about the comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently speeding through our solar system. Discovered in July 2023, the object is under close observation by the NASA-backed International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) due to its unusual characteristics. Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be an interstellar "Trojan horse," potentially hinting at extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<p>The IAWN has activated emergency monitoring protocols to track the comet's behavior, which has not aligned with typical cometary science. Loeb has raised alarms about its size, estimating it could weigh as much as 33 billion tons. He has described it as “at least a thousand times more massive than the previous interstellar objects we’ve seen.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Estimated weight: 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Emergency monitoring protocols activated by IAWN.</li>
    <li>Dedicated “comet campaign” scheduled from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>Observed emitting four grams of nickel per second, without detectable iron.</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration detected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. Following its detection, IAWN initiated emergency monitoring protocols due to its strange behaviors. On November 27, 2025, IAWN plans to begin a dedicated “comet campaign” to improve tracking methods and accuracy.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It’s at least a thousand times more massive than the previous interstellar objects we’ve seen,” said Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The hypothesis in question is that [3I/ATLAS] is a technological artifact, and furthermore has active intelligence,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If 3I/ATLAS is a massive mothership, it will likely continue along its original gravitational path and ultimately exit the Solar system,” noted Loeb in a recent blog post.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, interstellar objects observed in our solar system have been significantly smaller. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have prompted experts to consider the possibility of artificial design, which has not been a common topic of discussion in previous studies of comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will conduct its dedicated comet campaign from late November 2025 to January 2026, aiming to refine tracking methods and assess the object's trajectory more accurately.</p>
