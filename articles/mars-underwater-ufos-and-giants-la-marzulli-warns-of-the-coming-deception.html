      <h2>Mars, Underwater UFOs and Giants: LA Marzulli Warns of the Coming Deception</h2>

<p>In a recent livestream with Charisma Media, researcher and author L.A. Marzulli has discussed the rise of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and underwater phenomena, suggesting they signify a prophetic event he calls “the coming great deception.” He believes these occurrences are linked to biblical prophecy and challenge our understanding of physics.</p>

<p>Marzulli's comments come amid increasing mainstream reports of UFOs. He has highlighted the remarks of U.S. Representative Tim Burchett regarding mysterious objects operating beneath the oceans. He asserts that human weaponry has failed against these crafts, indicating a significant shift in understanding unexplained phenomena.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In his livestream, Marzulli discussed the growing evidence of UFOs and underwater phenomena, emphasizing their connection to biblical prophecy. He referenced U.S. Representative Tim Burchett's comments about these mysterious objects operating beneath the ocean. Marzulli also brought up Bob Lazar’s theories about gravity wave propulsion, explaining the implications for our understanding of physics.</p>

<p>He mentioned his research on Catalina Island, where he claims to have found evidence of a giant unearthed in the 1920s. Marzulli then highlighted drone footage from Yemen, where an MQ-9 reaper tracked an orb that remained unaffected by a missile strike, underscoring the limitations of current military technology against these unidentified entities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s a gravity wave, and the gravity wave is bending space, time as we know it, and moving the craft, which is why there’s no G-forces,” says Marzulli.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We found the Ralph Glidden photo. It shows a giant, at least nine feet tall, that was unearthed on Catalina in the 1920s,” he recalled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That’s an MQ-9 reaper tracking the orb. They fire a Hellfire missile at it—you can see the explosion—and the orb just keeps going,” Marzulli explained.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I believe we are this whole thing is ramping up to what I have labeled the coming great deception,” Marzulli stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Marzulli’s remarks come amid a broader conversation about the increasing number of UFO sightings reported in various media. His focus on historical anomalies, such as the discovery of a giant on Catalina Island, aims to connect modern UFO sightings with ancient accounts of mysterious beings.</p>

<p>The surge in interest surrounding UFOs has prompted both scientific inquiry and public speculation, as technology advances and more footage becomes available. Marzulli urges believers to remain spiritually discerning in light of these developments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Marzulli encourages individuals to remain vigilant and spiritually discerning as the phenomenon of UFOs continues to unfold, suggesting that this may be part of a larger prophetic narrative. Further investigations into these sightings and their implications are expected as interest grows.</p>
