      <h2>American presidents and their weird relationships with UFO conspiracy theories</h2>

<p>Hillary Clinton has expressed interest in investigating government files related to UFO sightings during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live in March. Clinton, the presumptive nominee for the Democratic nomination for president, stated she aims to make these files public if elected, emphasizing transparency in the government’s handling of this topic.</p>

<p>This matter has gained traction as public interest in UFOs persists, with a 2012 poll indicating that approximately 36 percent of Americans believe in UFOs, according to Kelton Research. The Central Intelligence Agency has released a database of public UFO files, yet discussions about potential government cover-ups continue. Clinton's interest places her among a notable list of U.S. presidents who have commented on UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hillary Clinton appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live in March 2023.</li>
    <li>36% of Americans believe in UFOs, according to a 2012 Kelton Research poll.</li>
    <li>The CIA has released a full database of public UFO files.</li>
    <li>Harry Truman was president during the 1947 Roswell incident.</li>
    <li>Jimmy Carter requested NASA to investigate UFOs in 1977.</li>
    <li>Bill Clinton reviewed the Roswell papers during his presidency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, an object crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, leading to widespread speculation about UFOs. Initially reported as a "flying saucer," the U.S. military later claimed it was a weather balloon. This incident sparked years of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>In 1969, Jimmy Carter reported a UFO sighting in Georgia. He described a strange light that changed colors above him and others. Carter later requested NASA to investigate UFOs during his presidency, but the agency declined.</p>

<p>In 1974, Ronald Reagan reportedly saw a UFO while flying in a plane. According to pilot Bill Paynter, a bright light accelerated away from their aircraft. Reagan later discussed this sighting with reporters.</p>

<p>In 2014, Bill Clinton mentioned his investigation into Area 51 and the Roswell incident on Jimmy Kimmel Live, asserting there were no aliens at the site.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I would like us to go into those files and hopefully make as much of that public as possible. If there’s nothing there, let’s tell people there’s nothing there,” Clinton said on Kimmel's show.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I have never thought and still don’t think it is possible for creatures from Mars to visit us,” Carter stated regarding his UFO sighting.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“First I had people go look at the records on Area 51 to make sure there was no alien down there,” Bill Clinton said during his appearance.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Roswell incident of 1947 has remained a cornerstone of UFO conspiracy theories for decades. Despite official explanations, public skepticism persists. Past presidents have navigated the complexities of UFO discourse, often balancing curiosity with national security concerns.</p>

<p>UFO interest has surged in recent years, partly due to government disclosures and public fascination with extraterrestrial life. Investigative efforts have included requests for transparency and research into unexplained phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the presidential election approaches, Clinton's potential investigation into UFO files could lead to further discussions about government transparency and public access to information on unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
