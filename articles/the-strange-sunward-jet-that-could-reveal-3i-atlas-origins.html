      <h2>The Strange Sunward Jet That Could Reveal 3I/ATLAS' Origins</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention from astronomers since its accidental discovery in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The object, estimated to be between 20 and 40 kilometres in diameter, is moving on a hyperbolic orbit at over 50 kilometres per second, confirming its extrasolar origin. Unlike its predecessors, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, 3I/ATLAS exhibits a peculiar jet pointing towards the Sun.</p>

<p>This anomaly has raised questions within the scientific community regarding the object's composition and behaviour. Authorities, including researchers from Harvard University, are currently investigating the implications of this sunward jet, which could provide insights into the nature of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery: July 2025 by ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Diameter: Estimated 20-40 kilometres</li>
    <li>Speed: Over 50 kilometres per second</li>
    <li>Jet orientation: Pointing towards the Sun</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>Observational evidence: Visible in images from the Two-Meter Twin Telescope, August 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, prompting immediate interest from the astronomical community. In August 2025, images taken by the Two-Meter Twin Telescope in the Canary Islands captured the unusual sunward jet, which has since been a focal point for further investigation.</p>
<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has noted several anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, including its trajectory and spectral signatures, suggesting that further data is needed to understand its behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The jet and anti-tail should not contain streaming gas beyond 5,000 kilometres,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the need for caution in interpreting the data.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the previous interstellar visitors, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have already contributed to the understanding of interstellar objects. The peculiar behaviour of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its sunward jet, poses new questions about the physical processes at play in such bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion, with researchers focusing on gathering more data to better understand its unique characteristics and the implications for the study of interstellar matter.</p>
