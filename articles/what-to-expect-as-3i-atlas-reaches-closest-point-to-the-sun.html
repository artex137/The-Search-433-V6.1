      <h2>What to expect as 3I/ATLAS reaches closest point to the Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023, marking a significant event for the celestial body. This perihelion will lead to changes in the comet's activity and visibility, according to NASA.</p>

<p>This encounter is noteworthy as it will provide scientists with new data and clearer images of the comet. The event will also address ongoing speculation regarding the comet's nature, with claims of it being an "alien mothership" possibly being resolved after the encounter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: 210 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Expected visibility in November 2023</li>
    <li>Comet's ion tail length: approximately 56,000 km</li>
    <li>Potential spacecraft encounters: ESA's Hera mission (October 25 - November 1) and NASA's Europa Clipper (October 30 - November 6)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, first observed on July 1, 2020, has been travelling through the solar system. As it approaches the Sun, it has remained hidden from Earth due to solar glare. The comet will reach its perihelion on October 29, where it is expected to become significantly more active, leading to a brighter and larger appearance in November.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency's Hera mission will be in proximity to the comet between October 25 and November 1, while NASA's Europa Clipper is expected to pass through the ion tail between October 30 and November 6. The ESA's Jupiter Icy moons Explorer (JUICE) will also monitor 3I/ATLAS in November, although data from JUICE may not be available until February 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The heat and radiation from our star lead the icy bodies to sublimate,” NASA has stated regarding the comet's interaction with the Sun.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb suggested that if 3I/ATLAS is a piece of alien technology, it could potentially use the Sun's gravity to alter its course and speed, a maneuver known as the “Oberth manoeuvre.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as one of the few interstellar objects observed in our solar system. The comet has sparked interest and speculation about its origins and nature, particularly regarding the possibility of it being an artificial construct, as suggested by some scientists.</p>

<p>This event marks a milestone in the study of interstellar objects, providing opportunities for scientific observation and data collection that could enhance our understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After the perihelion on October 29, scientists will closely monitor 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible again in November. The data collected from spacecraft encounters will be analyzed, with some results expected to be released in early 2024.</p>
