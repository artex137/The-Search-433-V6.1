      <h2>A UFO Festival is landing in Nakhon Nayok this February 2026</h2>

<p>The first-ever UFO Festival in Thailand will take place at Khun Dan Prakarn Chon Dam in Nakhon Nayok, approximately a two-hour drive from Bangkok, in February 2026. The event aims to attract UFO enthusiasts and curious travelers.</p>

<p>The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has organized the festival as part of a strategy to diversify Thai tourism, moving beyond traditional attractions like temples and beaches. The festival will cater to a niche audience interested in UFOs and extraterrestrial themes, marking a significant shift in the country’s tourism offerings.</p>
