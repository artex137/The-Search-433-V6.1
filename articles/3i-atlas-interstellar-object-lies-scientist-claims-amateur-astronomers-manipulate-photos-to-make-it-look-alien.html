      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Object 'Lies': Scientist Claims 'Amateur Astronomers' Manipulate Photos to Make It Look Alien</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025, has sparked controversy as a prominent scientist claims amateur astronomers are manipulating photographs to suggest it is of alien origin. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has criticized these claims, which threaten to undermine public enthusiasm for the object. The accusations have emerged as 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>

<p>This situation has implications for the scientific community and public perception of cosmic phenomena. NASA has released new images of 3I/ATLAS, but these images have been criticized for their quality, fueling ongoing debates about the object's nature and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 153,000 miles per hour at perihelion</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025, approximately 170 million miles away</li>
    <li><strong>First spotted by:</strong> ATLAS survey in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Notable features:</strong> Jets and anti-tail pointing towards the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Chile. Since then, it has exhibited unusual behaviours, leading to speculation about its origins. On 19 November 2025, NASA released new images of the object, which have been criticized for their lack of clarity. As the comet nears its closest approach to Earth, discussions around its nature have intensified.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Amateur astronomers can physically not make any detailed observations of the comet,” an anonymous astronomer stated in a Reddit post, arguing that atmospheric distortion limits visibility. “The enhancement techniques distort images, creating illusions of structure.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb has suggested that “it might be an alien spacecraft,” challenging NASA's assessment that it is a natural comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS highlights a broader issue in astronomy regarding the interpretation of data and the role of amateur astronomers. Previous incidents have shown that claims of extraterrestrial life often lead to public fascination but can also result in misinformation. The scientific community emphasizes the need for rigorous standards in image processing and data interpretation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, further observations and analyses are expected. The scientific community will continue to scrutinize the claims surrounding the object, while NASA's ongoing research may provide additional insights into its nature.</p>
