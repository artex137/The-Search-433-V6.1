      <h2>‘The public has been lied to’: secretly made documentary insists that aliens exist</h2>

<p>The Age of Disclosure, a new documentary directed by Dan Farah, asserts that the United States government has concealed evidence of extraterrestrial life. The film features interviews with high-ranking officials, including former Pentagon staff, who claim that proof of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) has been suppressed for decades. The film premiered on November 22, 2025, and aims to challenge public perceptions of UAPs, commonly known as UFOs.</p>

<p>This documentary matters because it raises questions about government transparency and the potential implications of UAP technology. Authorities, including members of Congress, have begun to acknowledge the need for greater public awareness regarding these phenomena. The film's contributors argue that understanding UAPs could lead to advancements in technology and energy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Director: Dan Farah</li>
    <li>Film premiere: November 22, 2025</li>
    <li>Notable contributors: Luis Elizondo, Jay Stratton, Marco Rubio, Jim Clapper</li>
    <li>Number of interviews conducted: 34</li>
    <li>Duration of production: Three years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Dan Farah began working on The Age of Disclosure, inspired by a childhood fascination with aliens and UAPs, and he aimed to create a documentary that presents credible evidence. Over three years, he secured interviews with key officials from the Pentagon and other government agencies.</p>
<p>In 2017, Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon official, left his role, claiming the government was hiding vital information about UAPs. His involvement in the film helped to attract more contributors, including Jay Stratton and Marco Rubio, who later agreed to participate.</p>
<p>The film emphasizes the geopolitical implications of UAP technology, suggesting that the U.S. has withheld information due to fears of foreign adversaries gaining knowledge about their capabilities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings,” said Jay Stratton, a former defense official featured in the film.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This [UAP] technology does stuff that we can’t do,” stated a former director of aviation security at the National Security Council.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Much of the research and intelligence about UAPs is on a need-to-know basis,” noted Marco Rubio, underscoring the lack of transparency in government disclosures.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary builds on a history of UAP sightings and government secrecy, tracing back to the infamous 1947 Roswell incident, which is often cited as the start of modern UFO conspiracies. Farah argues that the U.S. government has consistently withheld information out of concern for national security and geopolitical competition.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen increased interest in UAPs, with congressional hearings and reports acknowledging the need for transparency and investigation into these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the film's release, further investigations into UAPs are expected. Authorities may face pressure to disclose more information to the public and address the concerns raised by the film's contributors regarding national security and technological advancement.</p>
