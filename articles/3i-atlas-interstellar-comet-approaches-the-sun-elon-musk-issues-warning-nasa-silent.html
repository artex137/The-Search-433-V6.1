      <h2>3I-ATLAS Interstellar Comet Approaches The Sun: Elon Musk Issues Warning, NASA Silent</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, drawing attention from astronomers worldwide. Elon Musk has issued a public warning about the comet’s unusual behavior, while NASA has not commented on the situation, prompting speculation about the comet’s nature.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS marks a significant event for astronomers, as it will exhibit peak brightness and activity. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are monitoring the comet closely, although they have not provided public updates in response to Musk’s remarks.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion at approximately 14:00 UTC (7:30 PM IST) on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will come within 1.35 astronomical units (about 125 million miles or 202 million kilometres) of the Sun.</li>
    <li>Elon Musk has described the comet as “definitely not an ordinary comet.”</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are monitoring the comet but have not released high-resolution images.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to become visible again in late November or early December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has been traveling through the solar system and is set to reach its perihelion on October 30, 2025. Its unusual behavior has caught the attention of tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has publicly questioned the lack of updates from space agencies. As the comet approaches the Sun, it is expected to exhibit peak activity and brightness, providing a unique opportunity for scientific observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is definitely not an ordinary comet,” stated Elon Musk, highlighting observed anomalies including an inverted jet stream and abnormal acceleration.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If it were just a comet, the high-resolution images would have already been released,” Musk added, expressing concerns about transparency from official space authorities.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet is notable as only the third recorded interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Preliminary data indicates that it has high levels of carbon dioxide and nickel, suggesting a distant origin. The comet's unique characteristics offer scientists a chance to study interstellar materials and their differences from solar system objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion, astronomers will continue to monitor its activity. The comet is expected to re-emerge from the Sun's glare in late November or early December 2025, allowing for clearer observations and further study of its composition and behavior.</p>
