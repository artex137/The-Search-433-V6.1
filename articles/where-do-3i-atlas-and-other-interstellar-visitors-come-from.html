      <h2>Where Do 3I/ATLAS and Other Interstellar Visitors Come From?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been identified as one of only three confirmed interstellar objects to pass through our Solar System, joining the ranks of Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. This comet, like its predecessors, carries valuable information about distant worlds and their formation. Scientists have studied its unique chemical composition, which differs from known Solar System materials, confirming its interstellar origin.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS and similar objects is significant for astronomers seeking to understand the dynamics of the Milky Way and the processes of planet formation. The European Space Agency has planned a mission for 2029 to study a regular comet, with the potential to redirect for a closer look at an interstellar object if one becomes available.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is one of three confirmed interstellar objects.</li>
    <li>Only an estimated one octillion interstellar objects exist in the galaxy.</li>
    <li>Oumuamua was discovered in 2017; its origins remain unknown.</li>
    <li>The Sun is struck by an interstellar object approximately once every 60 years.</li>
    <li>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory and NASA’s NEO Surveyor are set to identify up to 70 new interstellar objects annually.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since the discovery of Oumuamua in 2017, astronomers have identified two more interstellar visitors: 2I/Borisov and 3I/ATLAS. The unique characteristics of these objects have led scientists to conclude they originated from beyond the Solar System.</p>
<p>Future observatories aim to increase the detection of interstellar objects, potentially uncovering many more that pass through the Solar System unnoticed. The European Space Agency's planned mission in 2029 will focus on a regular comet, with the flexibility to adjust its mission to study an interstellar object if the opportunity arises.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every new interstellar object offers a glimpse into another planetary system,” said a representative from the European Space Agency. “By examining their composition and motion, we can learn how planets form and evolve.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, Oumuamua sparked significant interest due to its unusual shape and speed. Scientists have since concluded it is most likely a natural fragment rather than an artificial object. The study of interstellar objects is essential for understanding the formation of planets and other celestial bodies in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As more interstellar objects are detected, astronomers will continue to analyze their compositions and trajectories. The upcoming launch of NASA’s NEO Surveyor in 2027 is expected to enhance detection capabilities significantly, potentially leading to a greater understanding of the origins of these cosmic travelers.</p>
