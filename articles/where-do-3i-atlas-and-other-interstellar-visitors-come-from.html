      <h2>Where do 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar visitors come from?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar objects that have passed through the Solar System, with its discovery leading to significant insights into the origins of celestial bodies. This comet, along with the other two interstellar visitors, has sparked interest among astronomers regarding their origins and implications for understanding planetary formation.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it helps scientists explore how planets form, evolve, and sometimes get ejected into interstellar space. Authorities in the field of astronomy are focusing on enhancing detection methods to identify more interstellar objects and potentially uncover their origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is one of three known interstellar objects, alongside ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Approximately 10 quadrillion objects are ejected into interstellar space from an average star system over its lifetime.</li>
    <li>There are around 60 interstellar objects within Jupiter’s orbit at any given time.</li>
    <li>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile aims to hunt asteroids and interstellar visitors.</li>
    <li>The NASA NEO Surveyor space telescope is scheduled for launch in 2027.</li>
    <li>Current technology estimates a mission to the Sun's nearest star would take thousands of years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, ‘Oumuamua became the first known interstellar object to pass through the Solar System. Its unique characteristics led to various interpretations, although scientists largely agree it is likely debris from another star. In subsequent years, 2I/Borisov and 3I/ATLAS were discovered, each exhibiting a chemical composition distinct from Solar System bodies.</p>

<p>Recent advancements in observatory technology, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, have enhanced the ability to detect these interstellar visitors. As scientists refine their detection methods, they anticipate discovering more interstellar objects in the near future.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Discovering more interstellar visitors would not just up our chances of finally tracing one back to its home,” said Asa Stahl, PhD. “For every new interloper we discover, we gain a window into planetary systems throughout the galaxy.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects is a relatively new phenomenon in astronomy. Prior to ‘Oumuamua, no interstellar visitors had been identified, leading to a surge in interest regarding the dynamics of star systems and planetary formation. The scientific community is actively exploring the implications of these findings for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming years, researchers will focus on improving detection capabilities for interstellar objects. The launch of the NEO Surveyor space telescope and the continued operation of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are expected to significantly increase the number of discovered interstellar visitors.</p>
