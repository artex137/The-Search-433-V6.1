      <h2>3I/ATLAS is chemically unusual, with methanol raging not just in the nucleus</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been identified as a chemical anomaly due to its rare methanol to hydrogen cyanide ratio, according to a study by astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. The observations took place from late August to October 2025, during which researchers noted that 3I/ATLAS displayed characteristics different from most comets.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about comet chemistry. Researchers have documented a strange chemical signature in 3I/ATLAS, suggesting that methanol is not only released from the comet's nucleus but also produced in its coma. This finding could enhance understanding of the chemical processes occurring in comets and their formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
<li>Observation period: Late August to October 2025</li>
<li>Location: Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), Chile</li>
<li>Key chemicals observed: Methanol (CH3OH) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN)</li>
<li>Notable ratio: Methanol to HCN ratio is the highest recorded in any comet</li>
<li>Previous notable comet: C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late August 2025, astronomers began observing comet 3I/ATLAS using the ALMA facility in Chile. Over the course of two months, they noted the unusual outgassing patterns of methanol and hydrogen cyanide. By October 2025, researchers confirmed that methanol was not only emanating from the nucleus but also being produced in the coma as the comet approached the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The molecules showed outgassing patterns distinct from one another, with HCN production being depleted in the sunward hemisphere of the coma, whereas CH3OH was enhanced in that direction,” the researchers wrote in their study available on the arXiv server.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery adds to the growing body of knowledge surrounding anomalous comets. Previous studies have shown that other comets, like C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS), display unique chemical signatures, but the high methanol to hydrogen cyanide ratio in 3I/ATLAS sets it apart as a significant finding.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue studying 3I/ATLAS to further understand its chemical composition and the processes at play within its coma. Future observations may provide additional insights into the behavior of this interstellar comet.</p>
