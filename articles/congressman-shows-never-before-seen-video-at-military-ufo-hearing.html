      <h2>Congressman shows never-before-seen video at military UFO hearing</h2>

<p>A never-before-seen video released on Tuesday by Congressman Eric Burlison appears to show a U.S. military Hellfire missile bouncing off a bright object tracked off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. The video was unveiled during a House Government Oversight subcommittee hearing focused on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), the military's term for UFOs. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this incident.</p>

<p>The hearing is significant as it highlights ongoing concerns regarding UAPs and their potential implications for national security. Authorities continue to investigate these phenomena, with the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) examining reports from military personnel. The video raises questions about the nature of the object and its potential threat to U.S. Navy operations in a combat zone.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video shows a Hellfire missile striking an object off the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>The event occurred on October 30, 2024.</li>
    <li>The video was presented by Rep. Eric Burlison during a House hearing.</li>
    <li>The waters off Yemen were an active combat zone at the time.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this incident.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon's AARO is investigating UAP reports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone captured video of a bright object off the coast of Yemen. The footage shows a Hellfire missile fired by another Reaper drone striking the object, which continued on its trajectory. The video was presented by Rep. Eric Burlison during a hearing on UAPs on Tuesday, where he emphasized the importance of transparency regarding military encounters with such phenomena.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Burlison stated, “I’m not going to explain it to you, you’ll see exactly what it does,” as the video was played. The footage raised concerns about the nature of the object and its implications for U.S. naval operations in the area.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The public should be seeing this stuff, and why you’re not allowed to, I don’t know,” said George Knapp, an investigative journalist and witness at the hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That’s the Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just (bouncing) right off,” said Knapp, commenting on the video.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I have nothing for you,” said a Department of Defense spokesperson when asked to comment on the video.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader investigation into UAPs by the Pentagon, which has been ongoing for decades. The AARO has been tasked with reviewing reports filed by military personnel, some of which remain unexplained. In the past, similar incidents have been attributed to optical illusions or misinterpretations of data.</p>

<p>The new video is reminiscent of a 2015 incident involving a fast-moving object captured in the "Go Fast" video, which was later determined to be an optical illusion involving a weather balloon. The sophistication of current military sensors has improved data collection for recent UAP sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO will continue to investigate UAP reports, with an emphasis on gathering more data from military sensors. Future hearings may provide further insights into the nature of these phenomena and the military's response to them.</p>
