      <h2>Video shown at House UAP hearing appears to show missile fired at object near Yemen</h2>

<p>A video presented during a House committee hearing on “unidentified anomalous phenomena” (UAP) appears to show a missile being fired at an object off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. The video was shared at a Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets hearing, where Representative Eric Burlison, R-Mo., described the object as an “orb.” There were no reported injuries or fatalities linked to the incident.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it aims to increase transparency regarding UAPs, which have intrigued the public and lawmakers alike. The Task Force, established by the House Oversight Committee in February, is focused on examining the declassification of materials related to UAPs. Representative Burlison indicated that the video was provided by a whistleblower and that an independent review is currently underway.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video presented on September 9, 2025, during a House committee hearing.</li>
    <li>Incident occurred on October 30, 2024, near Yemen.</li>
    <li>Two MQ-9 Reaper drones were involved in tracking and firing at the object.</li>
    <li>Missile fired was a Hellfire missile, alleged to be ineffective against the target.</li>
    <li>Houthi rebels have increased military tensions in the region since November 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone tracked an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen. A second drone fired a Hellfire missile at the object, which continued moving despite being hit. The missile's impact appeared to deform the object, with smaller fragments detaching from it.</p>

<p>On September 9, 2025, the video of the incident was revealed during a House committee hearing focused on UAPs. Representative Burlison noted the significance of the footage and emphasized the need for public access to such information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It kept going, and it looked like the debris was taken with it,” Burlison said. “I’m not going to speculate what it is, but the question is, Why are we being blocked from this information?”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“For too long, the issue of unidentified anomalous phenomena — commonly known as UAPs — has been shrouded in secrecy, stigma, and in some cases outright dismissal,” said Representative Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla. “Today, I want to state clearly: This is not science fiction or creating speculation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The existence of UAPs has garnered public interest as potential evidence of extraterrestrial life or hidden government programs. However, a report from the Pentagon in November 2024 indicated that many UAP reports were attributed to balloons, birds, and unmanned aerial systems. The report concluded that there was no evidence of extraterrestrial beings or advanced foreign technologies.</p>

<p>The Defense Department’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is responsible for collecting and analyzing UAP reports. The office has stated that it has not discovered any evidence of extraterrestrial activity to date.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident and the public disclosure of related information are ongoing. The Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets continues its work to ensure transparency regarding UAPs and related military encounters.</p>
