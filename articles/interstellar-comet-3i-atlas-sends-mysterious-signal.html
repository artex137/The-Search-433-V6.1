      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS sends mysterious signal</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, officially designated C/2025 N1, has surprised astronomers since its detection in early July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Chile. The comet has raised questions about its chemical composition and origin, as it is the third interstellar object observed after 2017's ʻOumuamua and 2019's 2I/Borisov. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant for the astronomical community, as 3I/ATLAS offers insight into material that formed around another star. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are mobilizing global observatories to gather data before the comet moves too far from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: Early July 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Detected by ATLAS survey in Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: Approximately 1.4 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Comet's nucleus size: A few kilometres across</li>
    <li>Comet's dust and gas trail: Tens of thousands of kilometres long</li>
    <li>High CO₂ to H₂O ratio detected in the coma</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. Within days of its discovery, astronomers confirmed its visible coma, indicating activity as it approached the Sun. Observations from various instruments, including the James Webb Space Telescope, revealed unique chemical properties, notably a high ratio of carbon dioxide to water.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The signal refers to the spectral data, which helps astronomers identify the materials making up the comet,” a NASA spokesperson said. “There is no evidence of anything artificial or alarming.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects had been observed: ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Each of these objects presented unique characteristics, prompting researchers to explore how planetary systems may differ across the galaxy. The detection of three interstellar objects within the last decade suggests that such fragments may be more common in our cosmic neighbourhood than previously thought.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System. Ongoing observations will help researchers understand the comet's behaviour and contribute to studies of interstellar material. There are no immediate deadlines or charges associated with this discovery.</p>
