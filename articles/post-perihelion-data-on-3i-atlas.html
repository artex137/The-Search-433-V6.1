      <h2>Post Perihelion Data on 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>New data on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been released by the Minor Planet Center and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory following its perihelion passage on October 29, 2025. The data covers the period from October 31 to November 4, revealing significant changes in brightness and non-gravitational acceleration.</p>

<p>This information is crucial for understanding the characteristics and behavior of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities are analyzing the data to determine the implications of the observed changes, including potential mass loss and its effects on the object's trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion passage occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS brightened by a factor of approximately 5 in the Green-band.</li>
    <li>The non-gravitational acceleration reduced by one-third from the value reported on October 29.</li>
    <li>Current perihelion distance is 1.38 astronomical units (206 million kilometers) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Measured radial acceleration: 1.1x10<sup>-6</sup> au per day squared.</li>
    <li>Measured transverse acceleration: 3.7x10<sup>-7</sup> au per day squared.</li>
    <li>Estimated mass loss during perihelion: greater than 13%, based on ejection speed of 300 meters per second.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS passed its perihelion on October 29, 2025. Following this event, data collected from October 31 to November 4 indicated a significant brightening of the object. The analysis compared this data with observations from October 5 to 8, highlighting a decrease in non-gravitational acceleration.</p>

<p>The ongoing study of these observations aims to clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS, particularly regarding its mass loss and the composition of its gas plume. Future observations, particularly spectroscopic analysis planned for December, will further contribute to this understanding.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The considerable brightening and blue color of 3I/ATLAS near perihelion could either be a signature of cometary mass loss or a hot engine,” said Professor Loeb. “This contrast offers a clean test of the nature of 3I/ATLAS in the coming weeks.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its anomalies compared to known comets. Its retrograde trajectory, mass, and gas plume composition present challenges to conventional cometary models. Observations indicate that it may not exhibit typical cometary characteristics, raising questions about its origin and nature.</p>

<p>The object's trajectory and composition have drawn interest from astronomers, particularly following its alignment with the radio “Wow! Signal” and its rapid brightening, which is unprecedented for known comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations will focus on the spectroscopic observations planned for December, which will help ascertain the composition of 3I/ATLAS and confirm or refute current hypotheses regarding its mass loss and behavior.</p>
