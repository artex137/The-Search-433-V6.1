      <h2>This comet has given researchers from Arizona insights into how solar systems are made</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I-ATLAS is currently close to the sun and is about halfway through its journey in our solar system, providing researchers from Arizona and around the world with valuable insights into solar system formation. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This research is significant because it allows scientists to better understand the chemical compositions of celestial bodies, which is often challenging due to the faintness of such objects around other stars. Kat Volk, a senior scientist with the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, emphasized the importance of studying 3I-ATLAS to enhance models of solar system formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I-ATLAS is currently halfway through its journey in the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet is primarily composed of ice and carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>Kat Volk is a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently behind the sun and not visible from Earth.</li>
    <li>Nasa will utilize a Mars rover to monitor the comet's progress.</li>
    <li>Backyard observers will have the opportunity to see the comet in December 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I-ATLAS has entered our solar system and is now close to the sun. Researchers have been studying the comet to gain insights into solar system formation. Currently, it is not visible from Earth as it is positioned behind the sun. NASA is employing a Mars rover to track the comet’s trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every time we get a better picture of what other planetary systems look like, it helps us test our models and test our understanding of what did that protoplanetary disk that all of our solar system formed out of, what did that really look like,"</blockquote>
<p>— Kat Volk, senior scientist, Planetary Science Institute.</p>

<blockquote>“It's just human nature to want to know, like, are we normal or are we really weird? and also it's a good way to test, like, do we actually understand how the solar system formed?"</blockquote>
<p>— Kat Volk, senior scientist, Planetary Science Institute.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Understanding the composition of comets like 3I-ATLAS is crucial for advancing knowledge about the formation of planetary systems. Previous studies of similar celestial bodies have contributed to the development of models for how solar systems evolve over time.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I-ATLAS with the Mars rover until it becomes visible to backyard observers in December 2023. Further studies will aim to refine existing models of solar system formation based on the comet's characteristics.</p>
