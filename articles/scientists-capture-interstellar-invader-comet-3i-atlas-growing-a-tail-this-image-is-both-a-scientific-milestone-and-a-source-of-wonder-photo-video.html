      <h2>Scientists capture interstellar invader comet 3I/ATLAS growing a tail</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has captured a striking image of a tail growing on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, located in our solar system, on August 27, 2025. The image was taken using the Gemini South telescope in Cerro Pachón, Chile. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System), is only the third known object believed to have originated from another star.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study materials from beyond our solar system. The growing tail of 3I/ATLAS offers insights into the comet's composition and the processes occurring as it approaches the sun. The images were collected in collaboration with the Shadow the Scientists initiative, which connects researchers with the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of image capture:</strong> August 27, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Gemini South telescope, Cerro Pachón, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar objects:</strong> 'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Tail length:</strong> Approximately 1/120th of a degree in the sky</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS initiative. The comet was imaged on August 27, 2025, as it approached the sun. The team observed a growing tail and changes in the comet's particles since the previous images taken by the Gemini telescope.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder,” said Karen Meech, team leader and astronomer at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “These observations provide both a breathtaking view and critical scientific data,” stated Bryce Bolin, research scientist from Eureka Scientific.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the earlier findings of 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which have provided valuable insights into the materials from other star systems. The study of these interstellar comets is crucial for understanding the formation processes of planetary systems, including our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists anticipate another opportunity to observe 3I/ATLAS when it emerges from behind the sun in November 2025, which will allow for further analysis of its composition and behavior.</p>
