      <h2>Comet Borisov misidentified as 3I/Atlas during close approach to Earth — scientists clear up the confusion</h2>

<p>Scientists have confirmed that the comet observed near Earth on November 11 was Comet Borisov, not 3I/Atlas, as previously reported. The misidentification arose when sky enthusiasts spotted a bright object streaking across the sky, leading many to assume it was the well-known interstellar comet 3I/Atlas.</p>

<p>This clarification is significant as it highlights the importance of accurate data in astronomical observations. Authorities and scientists have been cross-checking data from various observatories to rectify the confusion caused by incomplete early reports that circulated on social media.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: November 11</li>
    <li>Identified object: Comet Borisov</li>
    <li>Initial misidentification: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during flyby: millions of kilometres</li>
    <li>Discovery of Comet Borisov: 2019 by Gennady Borisov</li>
    <li>Comet type: Interstellar object</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 11, an intensely bright object appeared in the sky, prompting sky enthusiasts to report its sighting. Initial assumptions linked the object to 3I/Atlas, which has been in the news recently. However, after cross-referencing observations, scientists determined that the object was actually Comet Borisov.</p>

<p>The confusion stemmed from the similar appearance of both comets, which are interstellar objects with glowing clouds of gas and dust. As further observations were made, it became clear that the path of the newly observed comet matched that of Borisov.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The path of this comet matched Borisov, not 3I/Atlas,” said a spokesperson for the observatories involved in the identification.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Borisov is notable as it became the second interstellar object discovered after 'Oumuamua in 2017. Both comets have drawn attention due to their origins from outside the Solar System. While 3I/Atlas has exhibited unusual changes in color and brightness, Borisov has shown more stability since its discovery.</p>

<p>The mix-up between the two comets highlights the challenges astronomers face when observing similar celestial bodies, particularly during close approaches to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study the movement and brightness of Comet Borisov to gather more data. They also plan to monitor 3I/Atlas separately to understand its recent changes following its close pass to the Sun. This ongoing research will contribute to the broader understanding of interstellar objects and their behaviors.</p>
