      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS records oscillating jets in the antitail</h2>

<p>International astronomers have identified oscillating jets in the antitail of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently moving out of the Solar System. Observations conducted between July and September 2025 revealed unprecedented behavior in this object, which reached perihelion in October 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first observation of gas release of this type from an interstellar comet. The findings, which await peer review, provide valuable insights into the dynamics of interstellar objects and their formation in distant star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion was reached in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The oscillation period of the jets is about 7 hours and 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>The complete rotation of the core is approximately 15 hours and 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>The comet's antitail extended around one million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The observations were conducted over a 37-night campaign using the Telescópio Gêmeo of Dois Metros at the Observatório of Teide in Tenerife, Canary Islands.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered by the ATLAS system in Chile.</p>
<p>August 2025: Astronomers conduct a series of observations revealing oscillations in the antitail on seven specific nights.</p>
<p>October 2025: The comet reaches perihelion, showing significant changes in its coma structure.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: The comet makes its closest approach to Earth at about 270 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Characterizing these jets offers a unique opportunity to study the physics of primordial bodies formed in another planetary system,” said a representative from the research team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike these previous comets, 3I/ATLAS exhibits distinct cometary activity and oscillating jets, which highlight differences in the dynamics of material sublimation and ejection. This enriches the understanding of comet formation in distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey through interstellar space, aiming to refine models of gas and dust emissions from interstellar objects.</p>
