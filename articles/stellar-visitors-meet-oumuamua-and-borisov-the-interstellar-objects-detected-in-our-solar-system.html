      <h2>Stellar visitors: Meet Oumuamua, Borisov, and Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed the detection of Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object that entered the Solar System in July 2025, following the earlier discoveries of 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Both Oumuamua and Borisov have provided critical insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>This discovery highlights the ongoing interest in interstellar objects and the potential for new findings about our galaxy. According to scientists, hundreds of similar objects are estimated to arrive annually, but only three have been tracked so far. Advanced telescopes are essential for confirming the interstellar nature of these bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1I/Oumuamua</strong> detected in October 2017.</li>
    <li><strong>2I/Borisov</strong> detected in August 2019.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Oumuamua speed: <strong>26 km/s</strong>.</li>
    <li>Borisov speed: <strong>32 km/s</strong>.</li>
    <li>Borisov diameter: up to <strong>1 km</strong>.</li>
    <li>Estimated annual interstellar object arrivals: <strong>10 to 100</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2017, telescopes at the Pan-STARRS observatory in Hawaii detected 1I/Oumuamua as it approached the Solar System. The object exhibited a cigar-like shape and hyperbolic orbit, confirming its interstellar origin.</p>

<p>In August 2019, 2I/Borisov was identified by an amateur astronomer using a homemade telescope. This comet displayed a tail and coma typical of comets, allowing astronomers to observe it closely during its passage.</p>

<p>Finally, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, continuing the trend of interstellar bodies entering the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Astronomers have noted that these interstellar objects provide clues about planetary formation and the diversity of materials in the galaxy. Their unique chemical compositions differ from those found in our Solar System.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to these discoveries, the detection of interstellar objects was rare due to their small size and low luminosity. Many objects are less than 1 km in diameter and travel at high speeds, making them difficult to identify with conventional telescopes.</p>

<p>Future advancements, such as the operation of the Vera Rubin telescope, are expected to improve detection rates and enhance our understanding of the Solar System's interactions with interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations and studies of Comet 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects are expected to continue. Missions like ESA's Comet Interceptor are being prepared to intercept and study these cosmic visitors in greater detail.</p>
