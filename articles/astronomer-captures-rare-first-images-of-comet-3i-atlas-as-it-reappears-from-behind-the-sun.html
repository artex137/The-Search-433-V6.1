      <h2>Astronomer Captures Rare First Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS as It Reappears from Behind the Sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has reemerged in the night sky after disappearing behind the sun, with astronomer Qicheng Zhang capturing its first images using the Discovery Telescope at Lowell Observatory and a smaller 6-inch telescope. These observations come after the comet's perihelion, when it passed within 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) of the sun on October 29. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant for astronomers as Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Its unusual trajectory and high speed of over 130,000 miles per hour (210,000 km/h) suggest it originates from another star system. Zhang noted that the comet has displayed notable characteristics, including a rapid brightening and a shift in color as it approached the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July.</li>
<li>The comet made perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
<li>It is currently observable in the Northern Hemisphere.</li>
<li>The best viewing time is during morning twilight.</li>
<li>The comet is expected to become brighter in the coming days.</li>
<li>Qicheng Zhang captured the first images post-perihelion.</li>
<li>The comet travels at over 130,000 miles per hour (210,000 km/h).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023. On October 29, it reached perihelion, coming within 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) of the sun. Following this event, astronomer Qicheng Zhang captured the first optical images of the comet using both Lowell Observatory’s Discovery Telescope and a smaller telescope. This marks the first time the comet has been observed since it became obscured by the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet behaves exactly as one would expect for an interstellar object,” said Qicheng Zhang, emphasizing its natural characteristics.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“As it heated up near the sun, the comet’s icy surface began to release gases that contributed to its glow,” Zhang explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as one of the few interstellar objects observed in our solar system. Astronomers have noted that its trajectory is notably flat and straight, contrasting with typical comets that follow curved paths. There is also growing evidence suggesting that this comet could be among the oldest ever discovered, potentially dating back as much as 3 billion years, predating our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its passage through the solar system, astronomers will observe its behavior and characteristics closely. Efforts will continue to gather data on its composition and origins, with a focus on its potential transformation from exposure to cosmic radiation during its interstellar journey.</p>
