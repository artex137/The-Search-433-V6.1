      <h2>Everything we know about 3I/ATLAS: The confirmed comet speeding through our Solar System</h2>

<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers using the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, detected a faint, fast-moving object officially named 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1). This marks the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet and not an asteroid, following detailed observations that revealed signs of activity.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has significant implications for researchers studying material from beyond our solar system. Its trajectory indicates it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun, suggesting it originated from another star system. This offers a unique opportunity to learn about interstellar materials and their properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery Date: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Location of Discovery: Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Speed: Over 200,000 km/h (around 61 km per second)</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: Approximately 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to the Sun: 30 October 2025, within 1.4 AU (about 130 million miles)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers at the ATLAS telescope detected 3I/ATLAS. Following this, NASA confirmed the object's status as a comet on 30 October 2025 after detailed observations showed clear signs of activity. The comet is currently on a hyperbolic orbit, meaning it will not be captured by the Sun's gravity and will exit the solar system shortly after its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The hypothesis in question is that the recent interstellar visitor to our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, is a technological artefact,” stated Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University, who has proposed that the object may be an artificial probe.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to pass through our solar system, following the discoveries of ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The increasing observation of interstellar objects raises questions about the nature of materials from other star systems and their potential implications for our understanding of the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue studying 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. The comet is expected to become visible again through ground-based telescopes in early December 2025, after it re-emerges from behind the Sun.</p>
