      <h2>3I/Atlas is hurtling through the solar system. What does that mean?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object, is currently traveling through the solar system after its discovery by a Chilean observatory in early July 2023. The object measures approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometres) wide, making it significantly larger than previous interstellar comets.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/Atlas has sparked interest among scientists and the public alike. Initial reports classified it as a comet, but a paper by astrophysicist Avi Loeb of Harvard University suggested it could be an extraterrestrial spacecraft due to its unusual size and trajectory. This has led to widespread speculation about the nature of the object and potential extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered by a Chilean observatory in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>Estimated size: 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometres) wide.</li>
    <li>Considered the third interstellar object observed, following 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb published a paper suggesting it may be an extraterrestrial spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Loeb described potential visitors as "hostile."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July 2023, 3I/Atlas was discovered by a Chilean observatory. Within two weeks, Avi Loeb and researchers published a paper proposing that the object could be an extraterrestrial spacecraft, challenging initial classifications as a comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Hostile refers to people, places or things that are unfriendly, aggressive or antagonistic,” said Avi Loeb regarding the potential nature of visitors. </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object identified since 2017. Previous objects, 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also sparked speculation about extraterrestrial life. A 2022 Pew Research Center survey indicated that 65% of American adults believe in intelligent life on other planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and researchers will continue to study 3I/Atlas as it moves through the solar system. Further observations may clarify its nature and trajectory in the coming months.</p>
