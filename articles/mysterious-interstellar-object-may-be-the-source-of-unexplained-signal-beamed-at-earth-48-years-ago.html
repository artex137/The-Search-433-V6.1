      <h2>Mysterious interstellar object may be the source of unexplained signal beamed at Earth 48 years ago</h2>

<p>A mysterious space signal, known as the WOW! signal, which has puzzled scientists since it was received in 1977, may have originated from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested this connection as 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, having been detected by astronomers this summer.</p>

<p>This development could reshape our understanding of interstellar communication and the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including NASA, are preparing to observe the object as it passes close to Mars on October 3, 2025. Scientists are eager to investigate whether 3I/ATLAS may emit radio signals.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Detection:</strong> First detected summer 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Close Pass by Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>WOW! Signal Date:</strong> August 12, 1977</li>
    <li><strong>Connection Probability:</strong> 0.6 percent</li>
    <li><strong>Signal Duration:</strong> 72 seconds</li>
    <li><strong>Signal Source:</strong> Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 1977, astronomer Jerry Ehman recorded the WOW! signal, which lasted for 72 seconds and displayed unique characteristics. On August 12 of the same year, 3I/ATLAS was in proximity to the region of the sky from which the signal was detected. Fast forward to summer 2025, 3I/ATLAS was identified as an interstellar object making its way through our solar system.</p>

<p>As it approaches Mars, scientists are preparing to observe 3I/ATLAS closely, with hopes of gathering data that could clarify its nature and any potential signals it may emit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS could be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy, and the dust emitted from its frontal surface might be from dirt that accumulated on its surface during its interstellar travel,” said Avi Loeb in a statement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In case we detect an artificial signal from an interstellar object, how should we engage with it?” Loeb posed in his latest paper. He warned that an alien intelligence could pose a threat to the human race.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The WOW! signal remains one of the most intriguing unexplained phenomena in radio astronomy. Its characteristics have led to speculation about extraterrestrial intelligence. Meanwhile, 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered passing through our solar system, with previous objects generating significant interest among scientists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, NASA has unveiled a new tracking tool for the public to observe the object. Scientists are preparing to investigate whether 3I/ATLAS emits any radio signals, potentially providing more insight into its origins and nature.</p>
