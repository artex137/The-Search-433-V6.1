      <h2>Leaked US Air Force drone footage shows UFOs in airspace over the Middle East</h2>

<p>Two leaked videos from the US military reportedly show Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) in the Middle East. The footage, recorded by Reaper drones over 13 years ago, was released by reporters George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell. The incidents occurred on August 23, 2012, and in 2021, with the footage surfacing recently on January 30 and February 3, respectively.</p>

<p>The US Department of War and the intelligence community have officially classified these objects as UAPs. The release of this footage has intensified discussions among UFO disclosure advocates, who seek to unveil military encounters with unidentified crafts. Authorities have not commented on the leaked footage.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Footage recorded by US Air Force Reaper drones.</li>
    <li>First video shows three lights in a triangle formation over the Persian Gulf on August 23, 2012.</li>
    <li>Second video shows an orb-like object on the Syria-Jordan border in 2021.</li>
    <li>Objects exhibit no heat signatures or traditional propulsion systems.</li>
    <li>Release of the footage was announced by George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell.</li>
    <li>Rep. Eric Burlison revealed related footage during a UFO disclosure hearing on September 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Department of War has not responded to requests for comment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 23, 2012, Reaper drones captured footage of three lights moving in a triangle formation over the Persian Gulf. This video was released on January 30, 2026. In 2021, another orb-like object was recorded by a Reaper drone on the Syria-Jordan border. The details of this sighting were revealed on February 3, 2026. During a UFO disclosure hearing on September 9, 2025, Rep. Eric Burlison presented additional footage of an orb being struck by a missile while continuing to fly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “George Knapp and I have obtained and are revealing for the first time military-filmed footage of multiple UAP, officially documented and cataloged within Intelligence Community investigations as 'orbs' in formation,” said Jeremy Corbell.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The term Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) has replaced UFO in official government terminology. This change reflects a broader initiative to investigate and disclose information about unidentified aerial phenomena. Previous incidents involving UAPs have spurred public interest and debate about national security and airspace safety.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any ongoing investigations related to the leaked footage. The release of the videos may prompt further inquiries into the nature of these encounters and the government's response to UAP sightings.</p>
