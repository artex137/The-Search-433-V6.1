      <h2>The Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Making Its Fiery Solar Flyby This Week</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, approaches its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This flyby is significant as it marks the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system, providing scientists with a unique opportunity to study materials from beyond our solar neighborhood. Authorities, including various international telescope networks, are actively monitoring the comet's trajectory and behavior as it nears the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at perihelion: 1.4 astronomical units (approximately 130 million miles or 210 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Minimum distance from Earth: 1.6 to 1.8 astronomical units (about 150 to 170 million miles)</li>
    <li>Monitoring instruments: James Webb Space Telescope, Keck Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope</li>
    <li>Return to visibility: Early December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile discovers 3I/ATLAS. Subsequent analysis confirms its interstellar origin and hyperbolic orbit. As the comet approaches perihelion on October 30, 2025, astronomers note unusual physical and chemical behaviors, including jets of material directed toward the Sun.</p>
<p>Throughout its passage, telescopes monitor the comet's composition and surface changes. Observations are expected to continue until September 2025, after which the comet will be too close to the Sun for ground-based observations. Renewed observations are planned for early December 2025 as it exits the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS challenges established models of comet physics,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “Its unique behavior provides valuable insights into how interstellar objects interact with solar radiation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These interstellar visitors offer a rare glimpse into the materials and conditions present in other stellar environments, enhancing our understanding of planetary system development.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze its composition and behavior as it approaches the Sun. Following its perihelion, researchers will gather data on the comet's evolution as it departs the inner solar system.</p>
