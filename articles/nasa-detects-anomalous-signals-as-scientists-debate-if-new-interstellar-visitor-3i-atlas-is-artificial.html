      <h2>NASA Detects 'Anomalous' Signals as Scientists Debate If New Interstellar Visitor 3I/ATLAS Is Artificial</h2>

<p>NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System has detected the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in Chile on July 1, 2025. This comet, moving at a speed of 58 kilometers per second, is the third confirmed interstellar object ever found, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this discovery.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unique characteristics, which have sparked debate among scientists about its origin and composition. NASA's Deep Space Network and the Europa Clipper spacecraft have reported strange radio emissions from the comet, prompting planetary defense protocols to monitor these signals closely. Researchers have suggested that 3I/ATLAS may be between 8 and 14 billion years old, potentially predating our Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, in Chile</li>
    <li>Speed: 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 8 to 14 billion years</li>
    <li>Water emission rate: 40 kilograms per second</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026, at 0.36 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Candidate signals detected: 471,000 during December 2025 flyby</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System on July 1, 2025. In early January 2026, NASA's Deep Space Network detected anomalous radio emissions from the comet. On December 18, 2025, the Breakthrough Listen project scanned the comet for technosignatures. The comet is expected to pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We all would have been thrilled to find technosignatures coming from 3I/ATLAS, but they're just not there,” said lead researcher Benjamin Jacobson-Bell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has noted a 40% probability that such objects could be artificial in origin, highlighting the unusual 'sunward-facing anti-tail' observed.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has revived discussions about extraterrestrial technology, particularly given its unusual characteristics. The CIA's 'neither deny nor confirm' response to FOIA requests regarding the comet has added an element of secrecy to its investigation. This situation parallels previous encounters with interstellar objects, raising questions about their origins and potential implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its close encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026, scientists will conduct high-resolution observations of the comet. Investigations into its origins and properties will continue, particularly regarding its unusual chemical makeup and the implications of its radio emissions.</p>
