      <h2>UFO Found in Colombia Sparks Scientific Investigation</h2>
<p>A sphere-like orb, dubbed the “Buga Sphere,” has been discovered in Buga, Colombia, on March 2, 2023. Scientists have begun examining the object, which is about the size of a basketball, after it landed in the town’s vicinity. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the discovery.</p>
<p>The investigation into the Buga Sphere has gained significant attention due to its unusual characteristics and the mysterious symbols etched on its surface. Authorities are conducting tests to determine the object's origin, while public interest continues to grow amid various speculations about its nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: March 2, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Buga, Colombia</li>
    <li>Object size: Approximately the size of a basketball</li>
    <li>Researchers: Colombian scientists, including Jose Luis Velazquez</li>
    <li>Composition: Three layers of metal with nine mini microspheres inside</li>
    <li>Symbolic writing: Describes “the origin of birth through union and energy”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Buga Sphere was first observed in the skies over Buga, Colombia, on March 2, 2023. Following its landing, a team of scientists led by Jose Luis Velazquez collected the object and began a series of tests using X-ray technology. The researchers discovered that the sphere lacks any visible joints or welding points, suggesting it may not be of human origin.</p>
<p>Subsequent analysis revealed the sphere's internal structure and the presence of mysterious symbols. Reports indicate that artificial intelligence was used to decode the writing etched on the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Jose Luis Velazquez</strong>, a Colombian researcher, stated, “It is of artificial origin, in that it shows no evidence of welding, and its internal structure is composed of high-density elements. More testing is needed to establish its origin.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Neuroscientist Julia Mossbridge</strong> expressed skepticism, stating, “Buga Sphere, I really suspect it’s a piece of artwork. It looks so human-made to me.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of the Buga Sphere aligns with a growing interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). The U.S. government has acknowledged its research into UAPs, particularly through the establishment of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022. This agency investigates reports of UAPs and has defined them as objects that demonstrate behaviors not understood by current technology.</p>
<p>Prior incidents in Latin America, including a controversial presentation of alleged alien creatures to the Mexican Congress in 2023, have fueled public fascination and skepticism regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Colombian scientists plan to continue their investigation into the Buga Sphere to determine its origin and further analyze its composition. The results of these tests may provide more clarity on the object's nature and contribute to the ongoing discourse surrounding UAPs globally.</p>
