      <h2>Disclosure’s Edge: UFO Doc Ignites Clash Between Insiders and Scientists</h2>

<p>A new documentary titled "The Age of Disclosure" has brought allegations of government secrecy surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) to the forefront since its release on Amazon Prime on November 21, 2025. The film features testimony from 34 former government and military officials, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who claim that there has been an 80-year cover-up regarding non-human technology and intelligence.</p>

<p>This documentary has sparked renewed interest in congressional oversight of UAP research. A special screening took place on Capitol Hill last week, attended by bipartisan lawmakers, highlighting the film's potential impact on future investigations and policy discussions regarding UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 21, 2025, "The Age of Disclosure" was released on Amazon Prime. Following its release, a special screening was held on Capitol Hill, attended by bipartisan lawmakers. The film features claims from various former officials regarding a long-standing cover-up of UAP information.</p>
<p>James Clapper discusses a secretive U.S. Air Force program that tracked UAP over Area 51, stating it operated outside known channels. This has led to calls for congressional investigations into the allegations made in the film.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’ve seen evidence of non-human craft,” Clapper asserts in the film, as reported by Fox News.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” a Virginia Tech researcher stated, emphasizing the need for verifiable data in UAP science.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary arrives amid a backdrop of ongoing debates within the scientific community about the validity of UAP claims. Experts have urged caution, noting that many assertions lack peer-reviewed evidence, contrasting with significant astronomical discoveries such as the detection of dimethyl sulfide on exoplanet K2-18b.</p>
<p>Previous incidents, including crash retrievals dating back to Roswell, have fueled public interest and skepticism regarding government transparency in UAP research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congressional hearings are expected to address the claims made in "The Age of Disclosure," particularly those related to Clapper’s statements about Area 51. There are calls for further investigations into UAP phenomena, with experts advocating for rigorous funding and studies to reconcile insider testimonies with scientific evidence.</p>
