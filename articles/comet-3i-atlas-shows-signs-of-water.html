      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS shows signs of water</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has displayed signs of water vapor, marking the first detection of hydroxyl gas (OH) from a comet originating outside our solar system. Scientists detected this phenomenon using NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The discovery, made public on September 30, provides crucial data for understanding interstellar comets and their comparison to those born in our solar system.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it enhances scientists' understanding of the chemistry of exoplanetary systems. The presence of water vapor challenges previous assumptions about the behavior of comets at great distances from the Sun. Researchers continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gather more insights into its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected hydroxyl gas (OH) indicating water vapor.</li>
    <li>Discovery made by NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</li>
    <li>Water outgassing observed at nearly three times Earth's distance from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Comet was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third recorded interstellar visitor.</li>
    <li>Comet is releasing water vapor at a rate of about 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>Images of the comet captured by ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter in early October.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its status as an interstellar object. Following its arrival, scientists have worked to understand its characteristics, leading to the detection of hydroxyl gas on September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>In early October 2023, two Mars orbiters observed the comet's activity as it passed by the Red Planet, providing additional data for ongoing research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, a postdoctoral researcher at Auburn University. “ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn’t expect it.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When we detect water — or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH — from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, a professor of physics at Auburn. “It tells us that the ingredients for life’s chemistry are not unique to our own.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the interstellar objects 'Oumuamua and Borisov had been observed, with 'Oumuamua noted for being dry and Borisov rich in carbon monoxide. The discovery of water in 3I/ATLAS adds a new dimension to the understanding of interstellar comets and their potential to carry vital chemical elements.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its composition and behavior. Ongoing observations from space-based telescopes and orbiters will provide further insights into this interstellar visitor.</p>
