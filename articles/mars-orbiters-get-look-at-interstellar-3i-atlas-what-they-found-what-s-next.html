      <h2>Mars orbiters get look at interstellar 3I/ATLAS. What they found, what's next</h2>

<p>Two Mars orbiters, Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, have observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from October 1 to October 7, 2025. The comet is currently on the opposite side of the sun from Earth, making ground observation impossible.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar objects to pass through our solar system. The European Space Agency (ESA) reported that the spacecraft captured images of the comet's icy nucleus and surrounding coma, despite the challenges posed by the distance and the design limitations of the cameras.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS came closest to Mars on October 3, at about 18.6 million miles away.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at approximately 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>It is expected to approach the sun closely on October 30, at about 130 million miles away.</li>
    <li>The ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will observe the comet from November 2 to November 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be about 170 million miles in December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025, when it was confirmed to have originated outside Earth's solar system. It was initially spotted by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</p>
<p>The comet was confirmed to be an interstellar object after follow-up observations. Over the past few days, Mars orbiters have been imaging the comet as it travels toward the sun, with the closest approach to Mars occurring on October 3.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one," said Colin Wilson, project manager for both missions at the ESA. "I look forward to seeing what the data reveals following further analysis.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as one of only three confirmed interstellar objects in our solar system, following the discovery of Comet Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. Unlike typical comets that orbit the sun, 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it will eventually leave the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the observations from Mars orbiters, the ESA's Juice mission will provide additional data in late November. Scientists will continue to analyze the images captured from Mars and await further observations from various space telescopes.</p>
