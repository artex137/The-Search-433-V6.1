      <h2>Catholic filmmaker investigates UFO mysteries at the Vatican</h2>

<p>Catholic filmmaker Sam Sorich has begun work on a documentary titled “Age of Disclosure,” which explores allegations that the Vatican possesses evidence of non-human intelligence. The project follows claims made by former CIA official David Grusch during his 2023 congressional testimony. Sorich has stated that his film will articulate a Catholic response to these claims, which have gained traction among U.S. lawmakers.</p>

<p>The investigation is significant as it touches on the intersection of faith and contemporary issues surrounding UFOs. Sorich aims to engage with theologians and church experts to explore the implications of these allegations for believers. He has expressed concerns that claims like those made in Grusch's testimony could have a substantial cultural impact, necessitating a thoughtful Catholic response.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: “Age of Disclosure”</li>
    <li>Filmmaker: Sam Sorich</li>
    <li>Former CIA official: David Grusch</li>
    <li>Allegation: Pope Pius XII knew of a UFO crash near Milan in 1933</li>
    <li>Filming location: San Oreste, Italy</li>
    <li>Notable interview: Gregory Paolucci, founder of the Bunker Soratte museum</li>
    <li>Expected release: Late 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, former CIA official David Grusch testified before Congress, alleging that the Vatican has evidence of non-human intelligence and that Pope Pius XII was aware of a UFO crash in 1933. Sorich began filming for his documentary in late October 2023, visiting a military bunker in San Oreste where technology related to the alleged craft was reportedly studied.</p>

<p>During the filming, Gregory Paolucci discussed the historical connections between the bunker and the Vatican, although he could not confirm links to the alleged UFO incident. Sorich has faced challenges in obtaining interviews with Vatican officials, as the Vatican Observatory has a policy of avoiding discussions about UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “A film like ‘Age of Disclosure’ is going to have a massive cultural impact, and the Catholic response should happen at every level,” said Sam Sorich.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The subject of UFOs... is a very touchy one. Most everything done about them is tainted badly by charlatans who have poisoned the topic,” said Jesuit Brother Guy Consolmagno, former director of the Vatican Observatory.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This investigation occurs against a backdrop of increasing public interest in UFOs and related phenomena. Sorich’s film seeks to address a gap in the Catholic Church's response to these topics, which have often been dismissed as fringe or non-serious. Previous discussions at the Church of St. Anne within the Vatican have been characterized as part of broader cultural dialogues rather than focused UFO inquiries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Sorich plans to continue his investigation, possibly returning to Italy for further research. He aims to include insights from theologians, experts, and Catholics who have experienced paranormal events in his documentary.</p>
