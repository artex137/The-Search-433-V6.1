      <h2>Interstellar visitor raises big question as it arrives from direction linked to the WOW signal</h2>

<p>Comet 3I ATLAS has entered the solar system, prompting significant interest from the scientific community and the public. The object, which displays unusual characteristics, is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, passing at a distance of approximately 400 million kilometers.</p>

<p>Scientists are intrigued by 3I ATLAS due to its atypical behavior, which has led to speculation about its origin. Gary Boyle, an astronomy educator and former president of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada Ottawa Centre, has noted that the comet’s trajectory aligns closely with the area associated with the 1977 WOW signal. Authorities and researchers are now awaiting high-resolution images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which may provide further insights into the object’s nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever observed.</li>
  <li>It is expected to pass Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
  <li>The object is approaching from the direction of Sagittarius in the Milky Way.</li>
  <li>Boyle reported that 3I ATLAS has displayed seven jets, which could indicate outgassing or potential propulsion mechanisms.</li>
  <li>No major observatory has released a high-resolution image of the object due to a recent U.S. government shutdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS was initially identified as a comet but displayed behavior inconsistent with typical cometary activity. Early observations showed an anti-tail and no normal tail, raising questions about its classification. Over the course of several months, the object exhibited multiple color changes and produced jets, leading to speculation about its nature.</p>
<p>On October 2 and 3, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I ATLAS, but the data has not been released due to the U.S. government shutdown. Following the resolution of the shutdown, scientists are now awaiting access to these images.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Three I is the third interstellar object astronomers have ever seen,” said Gary Boyle. “The path seems to be coming from the middle of the Milky Way in Sagittarius, which is pretty odd.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It has already passed Venus, Mars, and Jupiter within tens of millions of kilometers,” Boyle noted, highlighting the object's unusual trajectory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The scientific community is waiting to see those clear pictures,” said Boyle regarding the unreleased images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I ATLAS adds to a growing list of interstellar objects that challenge existing astronomical knowledge. Prior to 3I ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects had been recorded, prompting debates about their origins and implications for our understanding of space.</p>
<p>The WOW signal, a 72-second radio burst detected in 1977, has long fueled speculation about extraterrestrial life. The proximity of 3I ATLAS's trajectory to this signal has reignited discussions about the possibility of alien technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>With the government shutdown resolved, scientists are now focused on obtaining and analyzing the high-resolution images of 3I ATLAS. These images may clarify the object’s unusual behavior and contribute to ongoing discussions about its potential origins and implications for understanding interstellar phenomena.</p>
