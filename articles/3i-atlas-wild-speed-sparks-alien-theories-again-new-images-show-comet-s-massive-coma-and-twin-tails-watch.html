      <h2>3I/ATLAS' Wild Speed Sparks Alien Theories Again, New Images Show Comet’s Massive Coma and Twin Tails</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is racing through the solar system and will reach Jupiter in March 2026, nearly five years before the Juice spacecraft arrives in July 2031. The announcement follows the release of a new navigation-camera image that has reignited public interest in this rare celestial visitor.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it highlights the rapid movement of interstellar objects, which enter the solar system at extremely high speeds. ESA noted that 3I/ATLAS is following a hyperbolic orbit, typical of such objects, and will leave the solar system after its approach to Jupiter. Scientists have begun using data from the Juice mission to study the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Perihelion:</strong> 2029 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Juice Spacecraft Arrival at Jupiter:</strong> July 2031</li>
    <li><strong>Comet’s Approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Juice:</strong> November 4, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Hubble Reobserved Comet:</strong> November 30, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, at a distance of about 2029 million kilometres. The comet was hidden from Earth-based telescopes during this time. Following this, the Juice spacecraft began its observation campaign in early November.</p>
<p>On November 2, ESA engineers downloaded a quarter of an image from the Juice navigation camera, revealing a well-defined coma and indications of two developing tails. The spacecraft made its closest approach to the comet on November 4, passing at a distance of nearly 66 million kilometres.</p>
<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope reobserved 3I/ATLAS on November 30, capturing the comet from about 286 million kilometres away, which showcased its rapid motion across the sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our ESA Juice team couldn’t wait until February when they will receive data on 3I/ATLAS from the mission’s science instruments.” - ESA</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The brighter upper extension in the frame is the plasma tail formed as solar wind interacts with ionised gases.” - ESA</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS has gained increased attention as scientists seek to understand their behavior and composition as they pass through the inner solar system. The unique characteristics of these objects provide valuable insights into the origins of our solar system.</p>
<p>ESA plans to release detailed measurements from five instruments—JANUS, MAJIS, UVS, SWI, and PEP—on February 18 and 20, 2026. These will offer the clearest view yet of how an interstellar comet behaves as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists expect to continue studying 3I/ATLAS for several more months before it disappears into deep space. The full dataset from the Juice mission will not reach Earth until February 2026.</p>
