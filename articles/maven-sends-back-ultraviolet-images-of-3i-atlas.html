      <h2>MAVEN Sends Back Ultraviolet Images of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA’s MAVEN orbiter has returned new ultraviolet images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured between September 27 and October 9, 2025. The images reveal the comet’s chemical composition and the amount of water vapor it releases as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>This data is significant for scientists studying the origins and evolution of comets. MAVEN's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) camera has provided insights that could enhance understanding of 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed from September 27 to October 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>MAVEN used its IUVS camera to capture images at various wavelengths.</li>
    <li>Ultraviolet images show hydrogen emissions from the comet.</li>
    <li>Principal Investigator: Dr. Shannon Curry.</li>
    <li>Deputy Principal Investigator: Dr. Justin Deighan.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's MAVEN orbiter began observing 3I/ATLAS on September 27, 2025. Over the following ten days, it employed its IUVS camera to take multiple images in various wavelengths, allowing for detailed analysis of the comet's chemical makeup. On October 9, 2025, the final images were captured, showcasing the comet’s coma and hydrogen emissions.</p>

<p>On September 28, 2025, an annotated composite image was produced, illustrating hydrogen atoms from three sources, including 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The images MAVEN captured truly are incredible,” said Dr. Shannon Curry, MAVEN’s principal investigator. “The detections we are seeing are significant, and we have only scraped the surface of our analysis.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There was a lot of adrenaline when we saw what we’d captured,” said Dr. Justin Deighan, MAVEN’s deputy principal investigator. “Every measurement we make of this comet helps to open up a new understanding of interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS has gained attention in recent years as they offer insights into the formation of the Solar System. Understanding their chemical compositions can help scientists trace their origins and the processes that shaped them.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the IUVS data will continue, focusing on the comet’s chemical composition and its implications for interstellar research. Scientists aim to publish findings that could enhance our understanding of cometary evolution and origins.</p>
