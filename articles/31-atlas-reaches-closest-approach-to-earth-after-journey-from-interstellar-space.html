      <h2>31/ATLAS Reaches Closest Approach to Earth After Journey From Interstellar Space</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 31/ATLAS has reached its closest approach to Earth early this morning, passing within approximately <strong>168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</strong> of the planet. Discovered in July, this icy object offers astronomers a unique chance to study material from another star system before it departs the solar system.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in its rarity and the insights it provides into the nature of interstellar objects. Scientists have been closely tracking 31/ATLAS since its discovery, monitoring its motion, brightness, and composition. Following this closest approach, the comet will continue its journey, expected to pass near Jupiter in early 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 31/ATLAS is also known as interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Closest approach occurred early this morning, at a distance of <strong>168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</strong>.</li>
    <li>31/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass near Jupiter in early <strong>2026</strong>.</li>
    <li>It is expected to cross the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune by <strong>2028</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>31/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. Since then, astronomers have closely monitored its trajectory as it traveled towards the sun. This morning, the comet achieved its closest approach to Earth, marking a significant moment in the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>After this closest approach, 31/ATLAS will continue to move outward through the solar system, eventually exiting and never returning.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a fleeting milestone in humanity’s study of visitors from interstellar space,” said a spokesperson from the NASA interstellar comet team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>31/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system, following 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov. Each of these objects has provided valuable data regarding the composition and characteristics of materials originating from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach, astronomers will continue to observe 31/ATLAS as it journeys through the solar system, gathering data that could enhance our understanding of interstellar materials.</p>
