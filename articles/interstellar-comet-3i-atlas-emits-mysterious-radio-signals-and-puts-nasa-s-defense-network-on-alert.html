      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS emits mysterious radio signals and puts NASA’s defense network on alert</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has emitted anomalous radio signals, prompting a global alert within the scientific community. The comet, confirmed as the third visitor from outside our solar system, was detected on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</p>

<p>This unusual behavior challenges current understanding of cometary physics and has led NASA to enhance monitoring efforts through its planetary defense network. The agency is collaborating with observatories worldwide to gather data on the comet, which is critical for deciphering the nature of the radio signals and understanding stellar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date Detected:</strong> October 24, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Signal Frequency:</strong> 1.6 GHz</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies Involved:</strong> NASA, ESA, SETI</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Visitors:</strong> 1I/’Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS astronomical survey system. Its unusual radio emissions were first detected on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT radio telescope. NASA activated its Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) to oversee monitoring and analysis of the comet. Observatories around the world have begun collecting data to understand the comet's composition and the nature of the signals.</p>

<p>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at a safe distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The nature of the signals captured by high-sensitivity radio telescopes is the main focus of the investigation,” a NASA spokesperson said. “We are racing against time to unlock its secrets before it returns to deep space.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The passage of 3I/ATLAS offers a rare opportunity to analyze primordial material from another star,” said a representative from the European Space Agency. “International collaboration is essential to speed up analysis and enable cross-checking of results.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows in the footsteps of two previous interstellar visitors, 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which provided valuable insights into celestial bodies beyond our solar system. 1I/’Oumuamua was noted for its elongated shape and unexplained acceleration, while 2I/Borisov resembled a long-period comet from our solar system, indicating similarities in comet formation processes across different star systems.</p>

<p>The current investigation into 3I/ATLAS's radio emissions might shed light on exotic physical processes or complex magnetic interactions within the comet, advancing our understanding of cosmic diversity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and collect more detailed spectrographic data in the coming months. The goal is to build a comprehensive profile of the comet, including its physical and chemical composition, before it moves too far away for detailed study.</p>
