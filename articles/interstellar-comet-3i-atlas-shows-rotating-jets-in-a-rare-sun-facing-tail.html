      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows rotating jets in a rare sun-facing tail</h2>

<p>Researchers have reported new findings about interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from Earth and continues its path out of the solar system. Astronomers have identified repeating jet structures in a sun-facing tail, also known as an “anti-tail,” in observations made over more than two months in mid-2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first time jet activity has been documented in an interstellar comet. The observations help scientists understand how material escapes the comet’s solid center as it warms under sunlight. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, and passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025. Although it is now moving away, researchers continue to study the data collected during its approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object confirmed to have entered the solar system.</li>
    <li>Data were collected over 37 nights between July 2 and September 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>The sun-facing tail measured approximately 1 million kilometers in length.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to the Sun was about 130 million miles from the star.</li>
    <li>It came within approximately 168 million miles of Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Two-meter Twin Telescope at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife was used for observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers tracked the activity of 3I/ATLAS from early July to early September 2025. During this period, they observed the comet’s jets change direction in a cycle lasting about 7 hours and 45 minutes. The scientists inferred that the comet completes one full rotation approximately every 15 hours and 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, followed by its closest pass by Earth on December 19, 2025. After this, it began moving away from the Sun and is expected to leave the solar system entirely.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Characterizing jets in 3I thus represents a rare opportunity to investigate the physical behavior of a pristine body formed in another planetary system,” the researchers wrote in their paper.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows in the footsteps of ’Oumuamua, which entered the solar system in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, which was discovered in 2019. While jets and anti-tails have been observed in comets from within the solar system, this is the first instance of such activity being documented in an interstellar comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS to learn more about its shape, movement, and origin as it moves toward the outer solar system.</p>
