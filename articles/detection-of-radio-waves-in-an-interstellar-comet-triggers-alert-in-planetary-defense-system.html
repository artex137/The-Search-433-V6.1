      <h2>Detection of radio waves in an interstellar comet triggers alert in planetary defense system</h2>

<p>The global astronomical community has confirmed unusual activity on the newly discovered comet 3I/ATLAS, prompting heightened monitoring of deep space. This interstellar comet, identified by the ATLAS survey system, is the third confirmed visitor to our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>The detection of atypical radio emissions and a high-speed trajectory of over 100,000 kilometers per second has intensified scrutiny from major space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). The findings challenge existing models of planetary formation and provide a unique opportunity to study primordial material from other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on October 24.</li>
    <li>Estimated speed exceeds 100,000 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth calculated for December 19, at approximately 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Radio emissions detected at 1.6 GHz by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are coordinating efforts for global observation.</li>
    <li>Comet dimensions range from 320 meters to 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 24, researchers recorded radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS using the MeerKAT radio telescope. This marked the first detection of such emissions from an interstellar object, prompting immediate analysis.</p>

<p>As findings emerged, NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office began centralizing information and coordinating a global observation campaign to ensure public safety and scientific transparency.</p>

<p>On December 19, the comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth, passing at a safe distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The trajectory of comet 3I/ATLAS does not pose any risk of collision with Earth,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This discovery reinforces the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a dynamic comet and opens new avenues for studying interstellar objects,” stated an ESA scientist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the earlier interstellar visitors ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have provided insights into the diversity of objects in our cosmic neighborhood. The ongoing analysis of these comets helps refine planetary formation models and improves strategies for detecting potential threats from space.</p>

<p>Previous discoveries have shown that interstellar objects can vary significantly in composition and behavior, making the study of 3I/ATLAS crucial for understanding the conditions of other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations will continue as scientists analyze the comet's chemical composition and dynamics. The data collected from 3I/ATLAS will be compared with findings from previous interstellar visitors to enhance our knowledge of cosmic materials and improve planetary defense strategies.</p>
