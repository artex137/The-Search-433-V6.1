      <h2>A mysterious black pyramid-shaped UFO has been spotted flying over Texas</h2>

<p>A black pyramid-shaped unidentified flying object (UFO) has been spotted over Trenton, Texas, on September 8, shortly after 8 p.m. ET. Two witnesses observed the object moving eastward for at least two minutes, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The sighting is significant as it adds to the growing number of UFO reports in Texas. Authorities, including the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), have been collecting sightings since 1974. They have noted that the object could potentially be a balloon, while military officials assert there is no evidence of extraterrestrial contact.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 8, 2023, at approximately 8 p.m. ET, two witnesses in Trenton observed a pyramid-shaped UFO moving eastward. One of the witnesses filmed the object from about 30 feet above the ground, capturing clear video of its movement. The object reportedly changed shape and emitted a pulsating light around its edges.</p>

<p>On September 7, a similar UFO sighting occurred in Hudson Falls, New York, approximately 9,000 feet above the ground. A witness described the object as large and black, with white lights around its edges.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is possible that the object was simply a balloon,” said a representative from NUFORC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is no evidence of extraterrestrial contact,” a US military official stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Texas has become one of the most active locations for UFO sightings, now referred to as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). The state ranks third in the number of sightings reported to NUFORC, following Florida and Washington. California leads with nearly 17,000 reported sightings.</p>

<p>Triangular or pyramid-shaped UFOs have gained attention, with reports indicating they have been sighted 20 times this year. A former US national security official, Matthew Brown, has claimed to have seen classified reports documenting military encounters with similar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
