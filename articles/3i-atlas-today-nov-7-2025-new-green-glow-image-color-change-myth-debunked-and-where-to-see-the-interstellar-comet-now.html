      <h2>3I/ATLAS Today (Nov. 7, 2025): New green-glow image, ‘color-change’ myth debunked, and where to see the interstellar comet now</h2>

<p>On November 7, 2025, new images from the Lowell Discovery Telescope have shown interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS glowing green in the early predawn sky. The comet, which has been the subject of viral claims regarding a supposed color change, remains trackable with small telescopes in the eastern sky, according to scientists.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it helps clarify misconceptions about the comet's appearance. Authorities, including the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), are mobilizing efforts to study and observe 3I/ATLAS. They have closed registration for an upcoming astrometry campaign aimed at refining tracking techniques for this rare interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Image captured on November 7, 2025, by the Lowell Discovery Telescope.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is visible in the eastern sky, low in Virgo, during early predawn hours.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million km (1.8 AU).</li>
    <li>IAWN has launched a campaign from November 27 to January 27 focused on the comet.</li>
    <li>Comet reached perihelion around October 29-30, 2025, at about 1.4 AU from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. The comet reached its perihelion around October 29-30, 2025. As of early November, it has re-emerged in the predawn sky, becoming increasingly visible to amateur astronomers. The Lowell Discovery Telescope captured a new image on November 7, which confirmed its green glow.</p>

<p>On November 6, the Virtual Telescope Project released an image that also confirmed the comet's visible coma, further supporting the observations made by Lowell.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We don’t have any evidence for the gas coma changing colors,” said Qicheng Zhang, co-author of a recent study on the comet's appearance.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory confirms it as a passer-by rather than a long-term resident. Observations of its gas coma and tail have led to public fascination and some misconceptions about its appearance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The upcoming astrometry campaign, starting November 27, will help refine tracking techniques for 3I/ATLAS. The global observing community is expected to provide further insights into the comet's characteristics as it becomes more visible in the coming weeks.</p>
