      <h2>What is 3I ATLAS? Here's when and how to see the interstellar comet this week</h2>

<p>This week, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 269 million kilometres. Astronomers expect that anyone with a powerful amateur telescope will be able to see the comet as it passes by.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is significant because it provides a unique opportunity to study the formation of planets in exoplanetary systems compared to our solar system. The comet was discovered in July by the Deep Random Survey remote telescope in Chile, which is part of the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) project. It is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 269 million kilometres (1.798402 Astronomical Units)</li>
    <li>Speed: about 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Diameter: less than 0.62 miles</li>
    <li>Composition: rich in carbon dioxide, emits cyanide gas and atomic nickel vapor</li>
    <li>Livestream of the event: begins at 11 p.m. EST on December 18, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025 by the Deep Random Survey remote telescope in Chile. Since then, it has been tracked by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. The comet has been on a journey from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, entering our solar system before its closest approach on December 19.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This erratic wanderer will be the closest to Earth that it will ever be over the lifetime of the entire universe,” said a representative from Space.com.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These chemical signatures help provide new insights into the chemistry of materials from beyond our solar system,” stated NASA regarding the comet's composition.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS continues a trend of interstellar objects entering our solar system. The previous two, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also sparked significant interest from astronomers and the public. The study of such objects helps enhance our understanding of cosmic formation and the dynamics of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will continue to observe its trajectory and chemical makeup. The public can follow the close approach through the livestream provided by the Virtual Telescope Project, weather permitting.</p>
