      <h2>How to find Comet Lemmon in the night sky as it brightens this October</h2>

<p>The past month has seen Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) brightening rapidly ahead of its close approach to the sun, with expectations that it could be visible to the naked eye by mid to late October. The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on October 21, 2023.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers and the public alike, as it provides a rare opportunity to observe a comet that may become a prominent feature in the night sky. Authorities and enthusiasts are preparing for this event by sharing tips on how to locate and view the comet effectively.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Lemmon has brightened from magnitude +21.5 to approximately +5.7.</li>
    <li>It is expected to be visible to the naked eye under ideal conditions.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass close to the star Alkaphrah in Ursa Major around mid-October.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to Earth on October 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>After October 21, it will travel beneath the constellation Serpens between October 26 and 27.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon has been observed brightening significantly since its discovery in January 2025. It is currently on a trajectory that will bring it close to the sun and Earth, creating ideal conditions for observation. The comet's brightness is expected to continue increasing as it approaches perihelion, enhancing visibility.</p>

<p>As October progresses, the comet will transition from being visible in the pre-dawn hours to the evening sky, making it easier for observers to spot it as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If Comet Lemmon continues its current brightening trend, it could become a beautiful, hazy naked eye target in the coming weeks,” said a representative from the Crni Vrh Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets typically become more active and bright as they near the sun, due to the heat and energy which vaporize their icy deposits. This phenomenon creates a coma and tail, which reflects sunlight, making comets visible from Earth. Comet Lemmon’s expected visibility adds to a growing interest in celestial events this year.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet Lemmon approaches Earth, amateur astronomers are encouraged to prepare by ensuring they have the necessary equipment, such as telescopes or binoculars, to view the comet. Observers should check local conditions and timing for optimal viewing opportunities in the coming weeks.</p>
