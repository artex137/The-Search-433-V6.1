      <h2>6 things you should know about interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, a unique celestial object, as it approaches our solar system. Discovered while it was approximately 410 million miles from the Sun, the comet is currently moving at about 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 kilometers per hour) and poses no threat to Earth, according to scientists.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third object confirmed to have originated from outside our solar system. As researchers study its characteristics, they aim to gain insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object observed in our solar system.</li>
    <li>It was first detected when it was within Jupiter's orbit, approximately 410 million miles from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of about 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 kilometers per hour).</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth will be 1.8 astronomical units, or about 170 million miles away.</li>
    <li>Data from the Hubble Space Telescope suggests its nucleus measures between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers across.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS originated from a distant star system and has been traveling through interstellar space for millions, potentially billions, of years. It crossed paths with our solar system recently and was detected while moving within Jupiter's orbit. Observations indicate that it is active, producing gas and dust as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>The comet will continue its trajectory through the inner solar system before it exits back into deep space, where it will not return.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite its dramatic appearance, scientists say 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to our planet,”</blockquote> as stated by astronomers observing the comet.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows two previous interstellar objects: 'Oumuamua', detected in 2017, and comet 2I/Borisov, spotted in 2019. Each of these objects has contributed to our understanding of the processes involved in the formation of planetary systems outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, gathering data to analyze its composition and behavior further. The comet's rapid movement poses challenges for observation but offers a unique opportunity for research into interstellar objects.</p>
