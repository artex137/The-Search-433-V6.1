      <h2>Mysterious interstellar object defies NASA's expectations as visitor nears Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth and has revealed surprising characteristics, according to NASA. The object is currently about 298 million miles from Earth and is likely a small comet, measuring approximately 1.7 miles in diameter, rather than the previously estimated 12 miles.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about interstellar comets. NASA's SPHEREx telescope has detected that 3I/ATLAS is releasing an unusual amount of carbon dioxide gas, about 940 trillion molecules per second, and is covered in water ice. This suggests that 3I/ATLAS may have formed in a star system with conditions vastly different from those in our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Current distance from Earth: 298 million miles</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: 1.7 miles</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide release: 940 trillion molecules per second</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope network</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Earth: December 17, 2025, at 223 million miles</li>
    <li>Speed: Nearly 150,000 miles per hour</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope network, which is tasked with detecting potential Earth-impacting objects. Earlier images from the Vera C Rubin Observatory in Chile also captured the object, but its significance was not recognized at the time.</p>
<p>New scans conducted in mid-August 2025 revealed that 3I/ATLAS is much smaller than initially thought and has unique properties, including a significant release of carbon dioxide. The object is following a path that will take it close to multiple planets, including Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The large amount of carbon dioxide suggests that 3I/ATLAS formed in a star system that doesn't look anything like ours,” said a NASA spokesperson.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This interstellar object is unlike typical comets we observe in our solar system, prompting further investigation into its origins,” added Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected entering our solar system. Previous discoveries have led to increased interest in the materials and conditions present in other star systems. The light spectrum observed from 3I/ATLAS has shown similarities to objects in the Kuiper Belt, hinting at the potential for organic materials and water ice.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists plan to continue studying its composition and trajectory. They aim to gather more data on the materials and chemicals present, which could provide insights into the conditions of its home star system, believed to be located on the other side of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
