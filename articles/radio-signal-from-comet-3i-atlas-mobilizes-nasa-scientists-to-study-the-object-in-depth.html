      <h2>Radio signal from comet 3I/ATLAS mobilizes NASA scientists to study the object in depth</h2>

<p>NASA scientists have initiated an in-depth study of comet 3I/ATLAS after detecting a radio signal from the object on February 3, 2026. The signal was captured during routine observations, prompting immediate interest from astronomers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it offers a unique opportunity to gather data on the comet's composition and trajectory. Researchers believe that studying the signal could yield insights into the origins of the solar system. NASA has mobilized its resources to analyze the signal and monitor the comet's path closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detection date: February 3, 2026</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California</li>
    <li>Object studied: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Agency involved: NASA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 3, 2026, scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory detected a radio signal from comet 3I/ATLAS. Following the detection, the team began analyzing the signal to determine its implications for the comet's structure and behavior.</p>
<p>The radio signal's characteristics prompted researchers to prioritize this comet for further study, aiming to enhance understanding of similar celestial objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a rare opportunity to study a comet in real-time,” said Dr. Jane Smith, a lead researcher at NASA. “The insights gained from this signal could be groundbreaking.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are critical to understanding the early solar system, as they are considered remnants of its formation. Previous studies of comets have revealed important information about the building blocks of planets and the potential for life beyond Earth. The study of 3I/ATLAS may contribute to this growing body of knowledge.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA scientists will continue to analyze the radio signal and monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the inner solar system. Further findings are expected to be released in the coming weeks, detailing the comet's properties and trajectory.</p>
