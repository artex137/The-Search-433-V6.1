      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS displays active ice volcanoes in new detailed images</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited active cryovolcanic eruptions, as revealed in unprecedented images captured by ground-based telescopes between November 22 and 27, 2025. The comet was observed at a distance of 378 million kilometers from the Sun, following its perihelion on October 29.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances understanding of the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Researchers from the Instituto of Ciências Espaciais in Spain led the study, which is available in the arXiv repository. The findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS shares characteristics with icy bodies in the outer Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed between November 22 and 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: 378 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: 440 meters to 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet follows a hyperbolic trajectory at 221,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Images captured by the Telescópio Joan Oró at the Observatório of Montsec.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, marking the third detection of an interstellar comet, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet's perihelion occurred on October 29, after which researchers began observing its cryovolcanic activity from November 22 to 27.</p>
<p>During this observation period, researchers noted spiral jets of gas and dust emerging from the comet's core, indicating intense sublimation of dry ice.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activity of 3I/ATLAS confirms that it shares characteristics with icy bodies in the outer Solar System,” said a spokesperson from the Instituto of Ciências Espaciais.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided insights into the composition of materials from other star systems. The current activity of 3I/ATLAS reinforces the importance of monitoring interstellar comets, as each detection expands knowledge about planetary formation in distant systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for further activity. Detailed observations are expected to be restricted to the next few months, as the comet moves deeper into interstellar space.</p>
