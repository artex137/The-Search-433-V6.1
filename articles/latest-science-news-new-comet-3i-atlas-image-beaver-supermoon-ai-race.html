      <h2>New Comet 3I/ATLAS Image Captured</h2>
<p>A new image of comet 3I/ATLAS has been captured by R. Naves Observatory in Begur, Spain, on November 5, 2025. The comet has recently become visible from Earth again after passing behind the sun.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The image of comet 3I/ATLAS comes as astronomers continue to study its transformation over billions of years of space radiation. NASA has reported that the comet brightened rapidly as it approached the sun, raising interest among scientists and enthusiasts alike.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: November 5, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of capture: R. Naves Observatory, Begur, Spain</li>
    <li>Comet's visibility: Recently emerged after passing behind the sun</li>
    <li>Previous observations: Not disclosed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been an object of interest since its initial discovery. It has recently undergone changes in brightness and color, indicating its complex interactions with solar radiation.</p>
<p>The comet became visible from Earth again on November 5, 2025, after its passage behind the sun. The latest images captured by astronomers have prompted further investigation into its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official Statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If this image is real… what are we really looking at?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Are we doomed?”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been under observation since it first entered the inner solar system. Its unique properties have made it a subject of fascination among both scientists and the general public. Previous studies have indicated that the comet has changed colors multiple times, with the latest observations suggesting it may have undergone another transformation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS for further changes and to analyze its composition. The ongoing research aims to enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their behavior as they interact with solar radiation.</p>
