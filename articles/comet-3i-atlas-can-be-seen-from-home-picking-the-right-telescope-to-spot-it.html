      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Can Be Seen From Home — Picking The Right Telescope To Spot It</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, officially known as C/2025 N1, is now visible from Earth and can be observed in the Leo constellation just before sunrise. It was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</p>

<p>This comet marks the third verified visitor from interstellar space to enter our solar system. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates it came from outside the Sun's gravitational influence. Authorities encourage amateur astronomers to use telescopes to observe this unique celestial object, as it provides a rare opportunity to witness material from another stellar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
  <li>It passed its closest point to the Sun on 29 October 2025, at a distance of about 1.36 astronomical units (AU).</li>
  <li>The comet made its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (269 million kilometres).</li>
  <li>As of 14 December 2025, the comet is visible in the morning sky before dawn.</li>
  <li>Observers need a telescope with an aperture of at least 150-200mm for the best chance to see the comet.</li>
  <li>The comet is expected to remain observable until spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by ATLAS. It reached its perihelion on 29 October 2025 and approached Earth on 19 December 2025. As of 14 December 2025, it has become visible in the Leo constellation.</p>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is visible in the sky before dawn, even with a small telescope,” NASA has stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This comet is notable as the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. Its unique origin and trajectory have sparked interest among both amateur and professional astronomers. The comet's visibility provides a chance to observe a celestial body that has traveled from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers are encouraged to prepare for viewing opportunities as 3I/ATLAS continues its journey. It is expected to dim below magnitude 13 early in 2026, making it essential for viewers to act quickly to observe this rare visitor.</p>
