      <h2>8 things that could happen if 3I/ATLAS gets close to Earth</h2>

<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, it is expected to create a bright coma and tail, making it potentially visible to the naked eye under dark skies. Astronomers have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no collision threat to Earth, as its hyperbolic orbit ensures it will pass safely at millions of kilometres away.</p>

<p>This event is significant for both amateur and professional astronomers. NASA and other space agencies are actively tracking the comet's trajectory, which offers a unique opportunity to study interstellar matter and engage the public in space science.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to create a bright coma and tail due to solar heating.</li>
    <li>It poses no collision threat to Earth, confirmed by astronomers.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass millions of kilometres away from Earth.</li>
    <li>Observers may see a faint greenish glow streaking across the sky.</li>
    <li>Potential minor meteor showers could occur if debris intersects Earth’s orbit.</li>
    <li>NASA and other agencies are tracking its trajectory closely.</li>
    <li>Mobile apps and websites are available for tracking and observing the comet.</li>
    <li>Historical interstellar objects have sparked public interest and speculation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, solar heating has begun to cause its icy nucleus to sublimate. This process has resulted in the release of gas and dust, forming a bright coma and tail. Astronomers have monitored its trajectory and confirmed its safe passage through the Solar System.</p>

<p>Currently, NASA and other space agencies are tracking the comet closely. Current models indicate that 3I/ATLAS will remain a safe distance from Earth, making it a visual spectacle rather than a threat.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS poses no collision threat to Earth,” said an astronomer involved in tracking the comet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Verified updates from NASA and professional observatories are the most reliable sources for accurate information,” an expert warned regarding potential misinformation on social media.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, interstellar objects like ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov have led to public speculation about alien contact and doomsday scenarios. Experts caution that social media may exaggerate the proximity of 3I/ATLAS, which could lead to unnecessary panic.</p>

<p>The data gathered from 3I/ATLAS can aid scientists in planning future missions to interstellar objects. Understanding its composition and trajectory will help refine spacecraft design for potential intercept missions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Educational events and viewing opportunities are expected to be organized by schools and amateur clubs to engage the public in this rare astronomical event.</p>
