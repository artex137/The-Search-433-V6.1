      <h2>US lawmakers hear from UFO witnesses at hearing</h2>

<p>US lawmakers have heard testimony from witnesses regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during a congressional hearing titled “Transparency Relating to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP)” on September 9, 2025. The hearing, which is the third since 2023, featured accounts of various sightings, including triangular craft, a hovering red square, and a luminous 'tic tac' object.</p>

<p>This hearing is part of ongoing investigations into UAPs, which have garnered significant attention from the US Congress and the public. Lawmakers are seeking to determine the nature of these sightings, with some suggesting they may involve advanced technologies from foreign nations rather than extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing date: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: US Congress</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Dylan Borland and Jeffrey Nuccetelli, former US Air Force personnel</li>
    <li>Notable sighting: A 100-foot-long equilateral triangle reported in 2012</li>
    <li>Another sighting: A massive glowing red square reported over military sites in 2003</li>
    <li>Video shown: Hellfire missile striking a moving object</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the hearing, Dylan Borland recounted a sighting from 2012 at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. He described observing a triangular craft that interfered with his phone and ascended rapidly without sound. Jeffrey Nuccetelli shared an experience from 2003, where he and other military contractors reported a glowing red square hovering above military installations at night.</p>

<p>UAP journalist George Knapp presented video evidence showing a missile impacting an unidentified object, claiming the missile bounced off without affecting the object. This video prompted further discussion among lawmakers regarding the implications of these sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "At approximately 0130 I saw an approximately 100 foot-long equilateral triangle fly from near the NASA hangar on base and come within one hundred feet of where I was standing," said Dylan Borland.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "It's coming right at us! It's coming right for us! and 'Now it's here!'" described Jeffrey Nuccetelli, recalling the panic of his colleagues during the sighting.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "That's a hellfire missile smacking into that UFO, and bouncing right off - and it kept going," stated George Knapp regarding the video shown at the hearing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Sightings and mysteries around UAPs are likely not aliens, but evidence of new technologies being developed by competing countries," stated Texas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing follows a series of investigations into UAPs, which have become a topic of interest for lawmakers and the public alike. The US government has faced increased pressure to provide transparency regarding military encounters with unidentified objects. Previous hearings have highlighted the need for a comprehensive approach to understanding these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers plan to continue their investigations into UAPs and assess the potential implications for national security. Further hearings and discussions are expected as the US government seeks to clarify the nature of these sightings and their origins.</p>
