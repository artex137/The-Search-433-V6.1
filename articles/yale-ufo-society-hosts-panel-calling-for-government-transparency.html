      <h2>Yale UFO Society hosts panel calling for government transparency</h2>

<p>The Yale Student UFO Society, in collaboration with the Disclosure Foundation, has hosted a panel on November 21, 2025, at Marsh lecture hall to advocate for government UFO disclosure legislation. Approximately two dozen attendees participated in the event, which featured discussions on the current state of public policy regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs).</p>

<p>This event is significant as it coincides with ongoing Congressional inquiries and proposed legislation aimed at increasing transparency about UFOs. The panelists included former National Science Foundation scientist Anna Brady-Estevez GRD ’09, former Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees staffer Kirk McConnell, and Dillon Guthrie, co-founder of the Disclosure Foundation. The panel aimed to foster dialogue on a topic often overlooked but gaining traction in political discussions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: November 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Marsh lecture hall, Yale University</li>
    <li>Panelists: Anna Brady-Estevez, Kirk McConnell, Dillon Guthrie</li>
    <li>Attendance: About two dozen people</li>
    <li>Related legislation: H.R. 1187</li>
    <li>Initial bill sponsors: Sen. Mike Rounds, Chuck Schumer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, the UFO disclosure bill H.R. 1187 was introduced in Congress to mandate the release of documents related to unidentified anomalous phenomena. The bill aimed to amend the National Defense Authorization Act and was modeled after the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Collection Act of 1992. Despite bipartisan support, the bill has failed to pass.</p>

<p>On November 21, 2025, the Yale Student UFO Society and the Disclosure Foundation held a panel discussion to address this issue and promote the need for transparency regarding UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We meet with Congress, we want to be here in academic institutions to talk about this and take this seriously. We also want to talk with Silicon Valley, there’s economic possibilities and economic risks associated with this subject, and Wall Street as well,” said Jordan Flowers, executive director of the Disclosure Foundation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There was a lot of hope, anticipation, that Trump would end up being the disclosure president,” McConnell stated, expressing dissatisfaction with politicians not following through on claims to uncover classified intelligence.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The push for UFO disclosure has gained momentum in recent years, with various Congressional inquiries examining the government's handling of unidentified flying objects. The stigma surrounding discussions of UFOs has begun to diminish, allowing for increased public interest and engagement.</p>

<p>Organizations like the Disclosure Foundation are working to bridge the gap between academic institutions and policymakers, advocating for transparency and research into off-planet exploration technologies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The panelists emphasized the importance of continued advocacy for UFO disclosure legislation in Congress, highlighting the need for public engagement and support as the legislative process unfolds this winter.</p>
