      <h2>Jackie Gleason’s former spaceship-inspired home ‘The Mothership’ asks $5.5M</h2>

<p>Jackie Gleason’s unique home, known as “The Mothership,” has returned to the market for $5.5 million in Cortlandt Manor, Westchester County. The circular residence was commissioned by the late comedian, known for his interest in UFOs, as a retreat during the filming of “The Honeymooners.”</p>

<p>The listing is significant as it highlights both Gleason's legacy and the architectural marvel designed by Robert Cika, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. The property, which has not been sold since the 1970s and previously listed for $12 million in 2018, showcases Gleason's eclectic taste and the craftsmanship of mid-century architecture.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Jackie Gleason commissioned “The Mothership” in the 1950s as a getaway during his work on “The Honeymooners.” The home was built over several years, with construction costs covered by CBS.

<p>The home was last sold in 1976 for $150,000. It was listed for $12 million in 2018 but did not sell, and has now returned to the market at a reduced price of $5.5 million.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Mothership is not just a home; it’s a piece of architectural history,” said Heidi Henshaw, the Corcoran agent handling the listing.</blockquote>
