      <h2>Navy Chief who witnessed a UFO says he convinced other colleagues with this chilling radar evidence</h2>

<p>US Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins has reported seeing multiple unidentified flying objects (UFOs) emerge from the ocean while aboard the USS Jackson on February 15, 2023. Wiggins has described his experience and the subsequent evidence presented to fellow officers.</p>

<p>This incident has drawn attention to the ongoing debate about unidentified aerial phenomena and the need for further investigation into such occurrences. Wiggins has shared his experience publicly, clarifying he speaks on his own behalf rather than as a representative of the Navy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: February 15, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: USS Jackson</li>
    <li>Witness: Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins</li>
    <li>Radar system used: Sapphire radar</li>
    <li>Number of UFOs observed: Four</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 15, 2023, Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins observed a UFO on radar while stationed on the USS Jackson. He reported seeing the object rise from the ocean and maneuver in ways he deemed impossible with known human technology. Wiggins then moved to a different position on the ship to confirm what he was seeing visually.</p>

<p>After observing the first object, Wiggins reported seeing three additional UFOs moving in coordination. He presented his findings to a tactical officer and attempted to view the objects on the Sapphire radar system. A video of the radar tracking the UFOs later gained attention online.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“From my observations, it did in fact come from the water,” Wiggins told the New York Post. “It was rising into the air high enough to where I’m like, alright, that’s definitely: A. too fast and B. not something I’ve seen before.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Wiggins explained his effort to convince fellow officers: “In utilizing the Sapphire system, you’re able to see silhouettes and heat signatures of different objects. So, in relation to the tic-tacs – once it went away at near instantaneous speed… it was kind of like ‘Checkmate,’ and he sat back down.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader discussion regarding unidentified aerial phenomena, which have been increasingly reported by military personnel in recent years. The Navy has acknowledged the need for a systematic approach to investigate such sightings, with some incidents leading to public interest and speculation about their origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for official investigations into this incident. Wiggins' experience adds to the growing body of reports that may prompt further examination of unidentified aerial phenomena by military and government agencies.</p>
