      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Glows in X-Rays and Life-Building Molecules as Earth Flyby Nearby</h2>

<p>As of December 10, 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, has been observed glowing in X-rays and displaying organic molecules as it travels through the solar system. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile, the comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 AU, or 170 million miles (270 million km).</p>

<p>This event is significant because it marks the third confirmed interstellar object observed passing through our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Scientists are monitoring the comet closely due to its unique characteristics and the opportunity it presents to study interstellar material.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (170 million miles).</li>
    <li>Peak brightness between magnitude 9–11, visible with telescopes and binoculars.</li>
    <li>Notable observations by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>ALMA study indicates high levels of methanol and hydrogen cyanide in the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 1, 2025: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered by ATLAS in Chile.</p>
<p>October 3, 2025: The comet passes Mars at approximately 0.19 AU (19 million miles).</p>
<p>October 29, 2025: 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion, about 1.36 AU from the Sun.</p>
<p>November 3, 2025: The comet flies by Venus at around 0.65 AU.</p>
<p>November 30, 2025: NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope captures new images of the comet.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: The comet will make its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are witnessing a unique opportunity to study an interstellar visitor,” said a NASA astrochemist involved in the research. “The chemistry of 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the building blocks of life.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system. Previous objects, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have raised questions about the origins and characteristics of interstellar materials.</p>
<p>The ongoing observations from multiple missions, including Hubble and the European Space Agency’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice), represent a significant collaborative effort in space science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Data from the European Space Agency's Juice mission will arrive on Earth in February 2026. Scientists will continue to analyze the comet’s chemical composition and trajectory as it moves away from the Sun.</p>
