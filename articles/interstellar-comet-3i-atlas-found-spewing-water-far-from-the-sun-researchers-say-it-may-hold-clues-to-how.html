      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS found spewing water far from the Sun</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected signs of water on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2023. The comet came within 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) of the Red Planet, marking it as the third known object to enter our solar system from another star system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into how water and organic materials may travel across the galaxy, potentially contributing to the formation of planets and life. Researchers continue to analyze the data collected from two spacecraft orbiting Mars and other observatories.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Speed of comet: estimated 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Hydroxyl emissions: 2.2 × 10³⁰ molecules in July; 4.2 × 10³⁰ in mid-August.</li>
    <li>Water production: approximately 40 kilograms per second (1.36 × 10²⁷ molecules per second).</li>
    <li>Surface area actively releasing vapor: at least 7.8 square kilometers (8% of the comet's surface).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars. During this event, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) successfully captured images of the comet, while Mars Express was unable to do so. Prior to this, researchers at Auburn University detected the ultraviolet signature of hydroxyl using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, confirming the presence of water vapor.</p>

<p>In July and August 2023, scientists observed a significant increase in hydroxyl emissions, indicating a rise in the comet's water production.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Each interstellar comet that has come by so far has been a surprise. ‘Oumuamua was dehydrated, Borisov was carbon monoxide-rich, and now ATLAS is losing water at a distance where we didn’t expect it. Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about the formation of planets and comets around stars,” said lead researcher Zexi Xing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its unique chemical composition. Unlike typical comets, it is water-rich but low in cyanogen, suggesting it may have formed in a carbon-poor region near a young, metal-deficient star. This finding contributes to a broader understanding of interstellar comets and their role in the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from the observations and explore the implications of 3I/ATLAS's findings for theories regarding the formation of planets and the distribution of life-building materials across the universe.</p>
