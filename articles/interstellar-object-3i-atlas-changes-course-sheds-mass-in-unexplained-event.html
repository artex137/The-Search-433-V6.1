      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS changes course, sheds mass in unexplained event</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, has lost 13% of its material as it approaches Earth, according to data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This event has raised questions among scientists about the object's nature and trajectory as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in its implications for our understanding of interstellar objects. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has noted that the loss of mass and subsequent change in trajectory are unusual for a typical comet. Researchers are eager to investigate further as 3I/ATLAS makes its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has lost 13% of its material.</li>
    <li>The mass loss occurred after a close pass by the sun last month.</li>
    <li>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported a change in speed and trajectory.</li>
    <li>New images from November 5 reveal no visible tail, contrary to typical comet behavior.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Last month, 3I/ATLAS made a close pass by the sun, which resulted in a significant loss of mass. Following this event, scientists observed an unexplained boost in speed and a change in trajectory. On November 5, new images were taken that showed no visible tail, despite expectations for a typical comet.</p>

<p>Harvard Professor Avi Loeb, who leads the Galileo Project, has commented on the object's anomalous behavior, suggesting that the trajectory change may indicate a controlled thrust from an artificial source.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For a typical comet, this should have resulted in a massive coma with dust and gas… No such tail is visible,” said Avi Loeb in a recent blog post.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is part of a series of unusual phenomena since its discovery. The object has previously displayed a sunward-pointing “anti-tail” and undergone unexplained color changes. While NASA maintains that 3I/ATLAS is a rare interstellar comet, its growing list of anomalies raises questions about this classification.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior, aiming to gather more data that could shed light on its unusual characteristics. The close approach on December 19 will provide a critical opportunity for further investigation. </p>
