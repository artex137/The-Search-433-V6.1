      <h2>Radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS lead NASA to strengthen its planetary defense program</h2>

<p>The global astronomical community is on alert following the discovery of comet 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025, through the ATLAS celestial survey system. This is the third interstellar object ever identified crossing our solar system. The comet travels at speeds exceeding 100,000 kilometers per hour and has prompted a coordinated response from space agencies worldwide to study its unique behavior and composition.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it offers a rare opportunity to understand celestial bodies from outside our solar system. In response to the unusual observations, NASA’s Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária has reinforced its teams to conduct continuous surveillance of 3I/ATLAS, analyzing its trajectory, composition, and potential anomalies during its passage through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet has a core diameter estimated between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Detected radio emissions at a frequency of 1.6 GHz on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA have confirmed no risk of collision with Earth.</li>
    <li>Intensive observation campaign planned during the comet's closest approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers identified comet 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS celestial survey system. Following its discovery, space agencies, including NASA and ESA, began to coordinate efforts to monitor the comet due to its unique characteristics.</p>

<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected radio signals from the comet, consistent with hydroxyl (OH) maser emissions. This finding further intensified scientific interest and prompted additional monitoring of the comet's behavior.</p>

<p>The closest approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2025, allowing scientists to conduct detailed observations while ensuring safety, as the distance poses no threat of impact.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA and ESA have confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS does not pose any threat of impact with our planet,”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The orbital calculations indicate that the object’s passage through the inner solar system will occur at a safe distance,”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it represents a unique opportunity to study the materials and dynamics associated with interstellar objects. Previous interstellar visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided insights into the formation of planetary systems, and 3I/ATLAS is expected to contribute further to this field.</p>

<p>The detection of radio emissions from the comet adds a new dimension to the study of such objects, as it can reveal information about the comet's internal structure and the gases it releases.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA’s Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária will lead an international collaboration to track and analyze 3I/ATLAS. A press conference is scheduled for August 2025 to present preliminary results and share data with the global scientific community.</p>
