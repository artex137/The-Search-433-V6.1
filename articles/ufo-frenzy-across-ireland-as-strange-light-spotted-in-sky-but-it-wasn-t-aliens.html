      <h2>UFO frenzy across Ireland as 'strange light' spotted in sky but it wasn't aliens</h2>

<p>A mysterious, bright light in the sky has baffled people across Ireland on the evening of October 19, 2023, sparking widespread UFO speculation. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the object after 6 p.m., describing it as "like a big object with light in front but no noise and moving very quickly." No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the sighting.</p>

<p>The unusual sighting has prompted reactions from weather experts and authorities. Alan O'Reilly of Carlow Weather noted that he received numerous messages from individuals across the country, indicating that the phenomenon was visible from various locations. After initial speculation, it has been clarified that the light was likely caused by the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket releasing fuel in orbit following its launch in Florida earlier that day.</p>
