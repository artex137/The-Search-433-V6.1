      <h2>Analysis of comet 3I/ATLAS reveals unprecedented chemical data and questions star formation</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that Comet 3I/ATLAS, detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, continues to captivate astronomers worldwide. The comet, the third confirmed interstellar object in the Solar System, displays unusual chemical compositions, particularly high levels of carbon dioxide in its coma, which surpass water levels and challenge traditional theories of comet formation.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it offers insights into the processes occurring in distant stellar systems. Due to budget limitations from a government blockade in the United States, NASA has restricted data dissemination, prompting collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and independent observatories to further study the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Approximately 220,000 km/h speed; predicted perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Initial activity began in May 2025, at 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Core estimated diameter between 300 meters and 5.6 km; over 8% of surface active.</li>
    <li>Comet displays a reddish dust tail, similar to 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>NASA's Swift telescope captured ultraviolet emissions in July and August 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet expected to pass near Venus in November 2025 and Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. Its activity began in May 2025, when it was 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun. Observations indicated significant carbon dioxide levels in its coma, prompting further analysis.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2025, ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter recorded images of the comet near Mars. By October 4, NASA's Perseverance rover captured images of the comet at a distance of 27 million kilometers.</p>

<p>In October 2025, the comet displayed an apparent pause in motion relative to background stars, which NASA attributed to subtle vibrations in its core detected by spectroscopy.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The abundance of carbon dioxide suggests formation in environments with extreme temperatures and pressures,” said a NASA spokesperson.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Our collaboration with ESA and other observatories has become crucial due to the budget blockade affecting our operations,” the spokesperson added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects have been confirmed in the Solar System. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS provide a rare opportunity to investigate the conditions of distant protoplanetary disks.</p>

<p>NASA's ongoing collaboration with ESA and independent observatories highlights the need for sustained investment in astronomy to study rare interstellar visitors effectively.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion on October 30, 2025. The agency will also assess the implications of its findings for theories of star formation and the evolution of planetary systems.</p>
