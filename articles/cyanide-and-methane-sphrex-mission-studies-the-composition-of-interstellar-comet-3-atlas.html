      <h2>Cyanide and methane: SPHREx mission studies the composition of interstellar comet 3/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A team of American researchers has studied the composition of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing the presence of organic molecules such as methanol, cyanide, and methane. The findings were published on February 6, 2026, following observations made by the SPHEREx space observatory after the comet's perihelion, the point in its orbit closest to the Sun.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances understanding of the materials that make up comets, which can provide insight into the early solar system. The SPHEREx mission, launched in early 2025, aims to conduct a panoramic survey of the sky in the near-infrared range. The mission has focused on 3I/ATLAS since its discovery in July 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx observatory launched in early 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet passed perihelion in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Organic molecules found include methanol, cyanide, and methane.</li>
    <li>Research published on February 6, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered, prompting various telescopes, including SPHEREx, to observe it. The SPHEREx observatory was launched in early 2025 to conduct a panoramic survey of the sky in the near-infrared range. After the comet passed its perihelion in December 2025, it experienced a significant increase in brightness and activity.</p>

<p>By December, researchers noted that the comet was "full-on erupting into space," releasing gases and organic material from its surface as it sublimated. Observations in August showed the comet contained carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water, while December observations revealed a more active comet with diverse materials being ejected.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, after its close flyby of the Sun, causing it to significantly brighten,” said study leader Carey Lisse of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “But now that the Sun’s energy has had time to penetrate deep into the comet, the pristine ices below the surface are warming up and erupting, releasing a cocktail of chemicals that haven’t been exposed to space for billions of years,” said Phil Korngut, an instrument scientist for the mission at the California Institute of Technology.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of comets like 3I/ATLAS is crucial in understanding the early solar system. Comets are considered time capsules, containing materials from the formation of the solar system. The presence of organic molecules in 3I/ATLAS may shed light on the origins of life on Earth, as these compounds are integral to biological processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from SPHEREx as 3I/ATLAS becomes more active, further exploring the chemical composition and behavior of the comet as it approaches the Sun.</p>
