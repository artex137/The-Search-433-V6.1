      <h2>3I/ATLAS Emanates Unusual X-Rays</h2>
<p>Scientists have reported new findings from observations of comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, during a study conducted between November 26 and November 28, 2023. The X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) detected a wide X-ray glow surrounding the comet, which extends nearly 400,000 kilometers from its nucleus. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the observations.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first confirmed detection of X-rays from an interstellar comet. Researchers are analyzing the data to understand how 3I/ATLAS interacts with the solar wind before it exits the solar system next year. The comet presents a unique opportunity for scientists to study interstellar objects in real time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed from November 26 to November 28, 2023.</li>
    <li>The X-ray glow extends nearly 400,000 kilometers from the comet.</li>
    <li>The emission was captured by the XRISM, a collaboration of JAXA, NASA, and ESA.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will exit the solar system in 2024.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>It travels at over 210,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 26-28, 2023, XRISM successfully observed comet 3I/ATLAS. During this period, the comet had moved far enough from the Sun for the X-ray emissions to be clearly detected. Researchers noted a faint X-ray glow around the comet's nucleus, which may be linked to a diffuse cloud of gas released by the comet as it travels.</p>
<p>The findings indicate that when the gas cloud interacts with the solar wind, charge-exchange reactions occur, resulting in X-ray emissions. Scientists have begun analyzing the data to confirm the source of these emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS remains a priority for the XRISM mission. We aim to improve data processing and further study the interactions between the comet’s gas and the solar wind,” said a representative from the XRISM team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic path and high speed indicate that it did not originate from the solar system. The comet's unique properties have sparked global scientific interest, as researchers seek to compare it with comets formed within the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the XRISM data to confirm the source of the X-ray emissions and further investigate the comet's gas cloud and its interaction with solar wind. The mission will monitor 3I/ATLAS whenever viewing conditions permit, aiming to complete data collection before the comet exits the solar system in 2024.</p>
