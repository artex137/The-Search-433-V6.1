      <h2>7 countries hosting public events or watch parties for 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers worldwide are observing interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System, with public events scheduled in seven countries. These events include viewing nights and watch parties, organized by astronomy clubs, planetariums, and universities, starting this week.</p>

<p>This global engagement highlights the excitement surrounding 3I/ATLAS, which offers a rare opportunity for both enthusiasts and casual observers. Authorities and organizations are facilitating these events to enhance public interest in astronomy and promote safe comet-watching practices.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Public events are taking place in the US, India, Chile, Australia, Japan, the UK, and South Africa.</li>
    <li>Locations include Griffith Observatory (Los Angeles), Lowell Observatory (Arizona), and various dark-sky areas in the UK.</li>
    <li>NASA has released public sky maps and livestreams for comet observation.</li>
    <li>Events feature telescopic viewing, astrophotography workshops, and educational sessions.</li>
    <li>Countries like India are utilizing areas with minimal light pollution for optimal viewing.</li>
    <li>Photography contests and guided tours are part of the event offerings in South Africa and Chile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, astronomers have initiated public viewing events across various countries. The events began this week and will continue as the comet becomes more visible. Astronomy clubs and local observatories have coordinated efforts to provide high-quality viewing experiences.</p>

<p>In India, states such as Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh have started organizing guided viewing nights, while Japan has launched public observation sessions that include educational discussions about the comet.</p>

<p>In South Africa, local astronomy societies have implemented telescope sessions and engaging educational programs to coincide with the comet's appearance.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These events are designed to inspire interest in astronomy and allow the public to connect with the cosmos,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are excited to provide opportunities for everyone to safely observe 3I/ATLAS and learn about its journey,” noted an organizer from a local observatory in India.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of comets is a significant event in the astronomical calendar, often drawing public interest and participation. Previous comets, such as NEOWISE in 2020, have similarly engaged communities and led to increased awareness of astronomical phenomena.</p>

<p>These public events are part of a broader trend to enhance science communication and accessibility to astronomy, particularly as advancements in technology allow for better public engagement.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, more events are expected to be organized in the coming weeks. Astronomy clubs and institutions will monitor the comet's visibility and adjust their public programs accordingly.</p>
