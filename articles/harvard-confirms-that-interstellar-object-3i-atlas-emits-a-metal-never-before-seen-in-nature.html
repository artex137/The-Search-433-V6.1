      <h2>Harvard confirms that interstellar object 3I/ATLAS emits a metal never before seen in nature</h2>

<p>Harvard University has confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, emits a metal not previously observed in nature. The comet, which passed close to Mars between October 4 and 7, 2025, is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing scientific understanding of cometary composition. Researchers are currently analyzing data from various high-tech telescopes to understand the implications of this finding and its potential ties to the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Close Approach to Mars: October 4-7, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated Age: 7 to 10 billion years</li>
    <li>Speed: 60 km/s</li>
    <li>Emission: Nickel detected in its coma</li>
    <li>Observation Tools: Keck II in Hawaii, European VLT, James Webb Space Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile. It approached Mars between October 4 and 7, 2025, allowing Mars orbiters to capture images. Recent analyses have revealed an unusual emission of nickel, leading to further investigations.</p>

<p>Following its close approach, astronomers have utilized high-resolution spectrographs to study the comet's emissions. The findings have raised questions about the nature of the materials released by the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery is so rare that scientists have had to look for a rather unusual chemical explanation,” said Professor Avi Loeb from Harvard. “If the object emits a molecule that we only know how to create in factories, we must consider the possibility of a technological or artificial origin.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this, interstellar objects such as comet 2I/Borisov have been studied, but they did not exhibit similar properties. The presence of nickel without iron in 3I/ATLAS challenges long-held scientific beliefs about the relationship between these metals in cosmic environments.</p>

<p>This anomaly has sparked considerable debate in the scientific community, with some experts suggesting it could indicate an artificial origin for the comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from telescopes to gather more information about comet 3I/ATLAS. Future observations will focus on understanding the chemical composition of the comet and the implications of its emissions for theories of extraterrestrial technology.</p>
