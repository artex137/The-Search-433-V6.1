      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas Captured in Unprecedented Detail by NASA</h2>

<p>NASA has released close-up images of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which recently passed 18 million miles from Mars. This marks the third confirmed object from beyond our solar system to be observed. There have been no injuries or fatalities reported in connection with the comet.</p>

<p>The observation of comet 3I/Atlas is significant for scientists, as it provides a unique opportunity to study material from a different star system. NASA plans to analyze the data collected from multiple spacecraft to gain insights into the formation of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object.</li>
    <li>It passed 18 million miles from Mars.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be 167 million miles in mid-December.</li>
    <li>NASA utilized three missions near Mars and two European Space Agency satellites to observe the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently visible in the predawn sky with binoculars or a telescope.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory confirms it will not return after its flyby.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was first spotted by a telescope in Chile during the summer. Its interstellar origin was indicated by its speed and path. Following its discovery, NASA and international agencies began tracking its journey through our solar system. The comet's close pass by Mars occurred recently, allowing for detailed imaging.</p>

<p>As of now, astronomers on Earth are monitoring the comet's visibility in the predawn sky, and the Virtual Telescope Project has shared enhanced images of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detailed imaging of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas marks a significant milestone for astronomy. This visitor offers an unprecedented glimpse into the building blocks of alien star systems,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets, such as 3I/Atlas, are celestial objects that originate from outside our solar system and travel on a one-way trajectory. Unlike regular comets, they are not bound by the sun’s gravity. The study of these visitors helps scientists understand the ingredients of distant worlds and the commonality of planetary systems like our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers worldwide will continue to study the data collected from comet 3I/Atlas for years to come. The comet will remain observable for several weeks before its departure from our solar system.</p>
