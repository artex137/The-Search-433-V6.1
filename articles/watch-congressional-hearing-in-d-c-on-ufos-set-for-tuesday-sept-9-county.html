      <h2>Congressional Hearing on UAPs Scheduled for September 9 in Washington, D.C.</h2>

<p>A congressional hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) is set for Tuesday, September 9, at 10 a.m. EST in the U.S. Capitol. The hearing will feature four witnesses, including U.S. Air Force veterans and a journalist, discussing UAP incidents primarily in Southern California.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it marks the third congressional inquiry into UAPs since July 2023. The Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets is hosting the event, aimed at addressing concerns about transparency and disclosure of UAP-related information held by federal agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date and time: September 9, 2025, at 10 a.m. EST (7 a.m. PST)</li>
    <li>Location: U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Four, including U.S. Air Force veterans and a journalist</li>
    <li>Hearing title: “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection”</li>
    <li>Chair: Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.)</li>
    <li>Live stream: Available online at the House Oversight Committee's website</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The hearing will begin with testimonies from the witnesses, who will share experiences related to UAP sightings. Notable incidents include reported events at Vandenberg Space Force Base and off the coast near San Diego. This session follows two previous congressional hearings on UAPs held since July 2023, which were the first in decades.</p>

<p>Witnesses include retired U.S. Air Force Capt. Robert Salas, who experienced a UAP event in 1967, and Chief Alexandro Wiggins, who observed UAPs during a 2023 incident involving the USS Jackson. These accounts aim to shed light on the ongoing discussion about federal transparency regarding UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans’ safety,” said Chair Luna. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Whistleblowers who provide details on spending information and policies and procedures regarding the classification and declassification of UAPs should be able to do so without retribution,” Chair Luna added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the hearings held since July 2023, there had not been congressional inquiries into UAPs for several decades. This renewed interest reflects growing public and governmental concern regarding the nature and implications of UAP sightings.</p>

<p>The Department of Defense established the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to study UAPs, further emphasizing the need for transparency in this area.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the hearing, Congress will assess the testimonies and consider potential legislative actions to enhance transparency and accountability regarding UAP investigations and disclosures by federal agencies.</p>
