      <h2>3I/ATLAS full of 'ice volcanos' as new images blow alien theory wide open</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of erupting “ice volcanoes” on its surface, according to researchers from the Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC/IEEC). This discovery, made as the comet approaches the sun, raises questions about the comet's composition and similarities to bodies in our solar system.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS, which originated from a different cosmic neighbourhood, shares characteristics with trans-Neptunian objects in our solar system. Researchers aim to further understand the materials that comprise the comet's surface and what this means for our knowledge of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed since July 2023.</li>
    <li>Research led by Josep Trigo-Rodríguez from the Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC/IEEC).</li>
    <li>Discovery of “ice volcanoes” on the comet's surface.</li>
    <li>Comet originates from a different planetary system.</li>
    <li>Similarities found with trans-Neptunian objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, observers first noted the presence of 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Researchers have since studied the comet's surface, leading to the recent discovery of erupting “ice volcanoes” as it approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We were all surprised. Being a comet formed in a remote planetary system, it is remarkable that the mixture of materials forming the surface of the body has resemblance with trans-Neptunian objects,” said Josep Trigo-Rodríguez, the study's lead author.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery adds to the ongoing research into interstellar objects and their characteristics. Prior studies have examined the origins and compositions of various comets, but 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity to explore an object from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further studies on 3I/ATLAS to better understand its surface composition and the implications of its similarities to known solar system bodies.</p>
