      <h2>Stephen Hawking’s warnings about aliens gain strength with the passage of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has passed through the Solar System, reigniting discussions around the potential risks of contact with advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. Discovered in mid-2025, the comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 210 million kilometers. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have mobilized resources to monitor the comet, which does not pose a collision threat to Earth.</p>

<p>The comet’s unusual chemical composition and trajectory serve as a reminder of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking's warnings about the dangers of contacting advanced civilizations. The comet presents a unique opportunity to study interstellar material and prompts reflection on humanity's place in the universe. While the analysis of its hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its interstellar origin, scientists have raised questions about its peculiar characteristics and potential technological origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth was approximately 270 million kilometers in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Estimated speed of the comet is 60 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are actively monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>Telescópio Espacial James Webb detected complex organic compounds in the comet.</li>
    <li>Monitoring campaign coordinated by the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) ran from November 2025 to January 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was officially identified on July 1, 2025, following its detection in archive images from June 2025. The comet reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. Observations from the Telescópio Espacial James Webb provided crucial data about its composition, revealing unexpected elements such as nickel vapors.</p>

<p>In December 2025, the comet made its closest approach to Earth, approximately 270 million kilometers away. Ongoing monitoring has continued as the comet moves away from the Sun, with various missions collecting data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS poses no impact risk. Its orbit has kept it at a safe distance,” said a NASA spokesperson. </blockquote>
<blockquote>“The presence of such an exotic object prompts urgent questions about our communications with the cosmos,” stated a representative from ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Stephen Hawking expressed concerns in 2010 about actively sending messages into space, warning that contact with advanced civilizations could mirror the catastrophic encounters between Europeans and indigenous populations in the Americas. His views align with the “dark forest hypothesis,” suggesting that civilizations may choose silence to avoid detection by potentially hostile species.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS, which carries material from distant star systems, underscores the urgency of these discussions. The comet is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, and its unique characteristics have sparked debate about its origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue as it moves deeper into space. Missions like ESA’s Juice are scheduled to observe its activity and any changes in behavior. The data collected will inform future missions, including ESA’s planned Comet Interceptor, set to launch in 2029.</p>
