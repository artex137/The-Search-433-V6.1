      <h2>3I/ATLAS livestream: Watch interstellar comet live as it comes closest to Earth tonight</h2>

<p>Skywatchers can witness interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it makes its closest approach to Earth tonight, with a live online broadcast available worldwide. The comet will be approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 168 million miles, away when it reaches its closest point at 1 AM ET on December 19.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected passing through our solar system, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The Virtual Telescope Project will offer a free livestream starting at 11 PM ET on December 18, showcasing live views from its robotic observatories in Manciano, Italy, weather permitting.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> 1 AM ET on December 19</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Approximately 1.8 astronomical units (168 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream Start:</strong> 11 PM ET on December 18</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Observations:</strong> Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Objects:</strong> 1I/‘Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by NASA-funded ATLAS telescopes in Chile. Since its discovery, astronomers have tracked its trajectory, confirming that it originates beyond our solar system. The comet is classified as an 'active comet' due to its heating as it approaches the Sun, which excites scientists about its potential observations.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2023, the Virtual Telescope Project will begin its livestream at 11 PM ET, allowing viewers to observe the comet in real-time as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is merely a visitor, destined to continue its journey and eventually return to interstellar space,” according to Space.com.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet heats up as it approaches the Sun, causing frozen gases to sublimate into vapor, which creates a glowing coma and often a visible tail,” stated BBC Sky at Night Magazine.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to pass through our solar system. The first was 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019. These objects provide scientists with valuable insights into the materials and conditions present in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS using powerful space telescopes to gather more data about its shape, size, and composition. Further observations are expected in July 2025 when new data from the Gemini North Telescope will be available.</p>
