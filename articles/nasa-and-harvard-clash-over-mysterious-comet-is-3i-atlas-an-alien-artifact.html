      <h2>NASA and Harvard Clash Over Mysterious Comet—Is 3I/ATLAS an Alien Artifact?</h2>

<p>NASA and Harvard University have engaged in a public debate regarding the nature of comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object discovered in July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS program in Chile. This comet is notable as only the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The discussion centers on the unusual trajectory of 3I/ATLAS, which may bring it close to Jupiter. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet could be an alien "mothership" capable of deploying smaller probes. NASA has countered this theory, asserting that 3I/ATLAS is a typical comet, despite growing public interest and speculation on social media.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered by NASA’s ATLAS program in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb proposes it might be an alien mothership.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Amit Kshatriya states it is definitely a comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS expected to pass Earth in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Changes in its trajectory have been noted, possibly due to gas release.</li>
    <li>Loeb believes the changes indicate intelligent design.</li>
    <li>NASA is considering a closer examination with the Juno spacecraft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS program. Since its discovery, scientists have observed its unusual path, which may lead it close to Jupiter. In November 2025, Avi Loeb published a theory suggesting that the comet might be an alien artifact. NASA held a press conference where Amit Kshatriya reiterated that 3I/ATLAS is a typical comet, despite the public's fascination with the alien theory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, NASA: "3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet, and photos taken by the Lucy mission show a typical comet’s tail."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, Harvard: "The changes in the object’s path could mean intelligent design instead of just random cosmic forces."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate over 3I/ATLAS follows previous incidents, notably the discovery of ‘Oumuamua, which initially sparked similar speculation about alien technology. Many scientists argue that the behavior of 3I/ATLAS can be explained through natural phenomena, but Loeb’s past work lends credibility to his theories. The scientific community remains divided on the object’s nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is considering further studies of 3I/ATLAS using its Juno spacecraft as it approaches Jupiter. The ongoing debate may prompt increased scrutiny of interstellar objects and their characteristics, regardless of whether 3I/ATLAS is ultimately found to be a natural comet or something more extraordinary.</p>
