      <h2>Drone footage shows UFO hit by missile off Yemen coast</h2>
<p>A drone has captured footage of an unidentified object being struck by a missile off the coast of Yemen on October 2024, according to a congressional hearing held on September 9, 2024. The object reportedly caught fire and exploded but continued to fly after being hit by the missile.</p>

<p>The release of this footage is significant as it raises questions about unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs. Lawmakers are seeking more transparency from the U.S. government regarding its knowledge of such incidents, amidst claims from whistleblowers about military encounters with UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: October 2024</li>
    <li>Footage released during a congressional hearing on UAPs on September 9, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Type of drone: MQ-9 Reaper</li>
    <li>Missile type: Hellfire missile</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Representative Eric Burlison, journalist George Knapp</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone tracked an unidentified glowing orb off the coast of Yemen. The drone fired a Hellfire missile at the object, which did not appear to be affected by the strike. The video was made public during a congressional hearing on September 9, 2024.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Representative Eric Burlison described the footage as "startling evidence." He questioned George Knapp, a journalist familiar with UFO incidents, about the implications of the video. Knapp indicated that similar footage exists but has not been made available to the public.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “A Reaper drone fired a Hellfire missile at this thing. And the missile didn’t seem to have any effect,” said Representative Eric Burlison during the hearing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “But that's a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bounce right off, and it kept going,” journalist George Knapp stated, expressing his astonishment at the incident.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a series of UAP-related testimonies and claims made by military personnel, including a recent testimony from U.S. Air Force veteran Dylan Borland. He described an encounter with a triangular craft near Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in 2012.</p>

<p>The U.S. government has faced increasing pressure to disclose information about UAPs, especially following revelations from military whistleblowers about encounters with unidentified objects that reportedly defy the laws of physics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers are expected to continue pressing for answers regarding UAPs and the extent of the military's knowledge. Investigations into the footage and other reported incidents are ongoing, with a focus on transparency and accountability from the Pentagon.</p>
