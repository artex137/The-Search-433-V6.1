      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-06 17:56 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shows Non-Gravitational Acceleration and Color Change</h2>
<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has exhibited signs of non-gravitational acceleration and a notable color change since its discovery on July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The object is currently located behind the Sun from Earth’s perspective, which has limited direct observations.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it marks 3I/ATLAS as the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Scientists are closely monitoring its behavior and composition, as understanding this object could provide valuable insights into the conditions of the early universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>It has an eccentricity value between 6.1 and 6.2.</li>
    <li>The object is approximately 10 billion years old.</li>
    <li>During its perihelion on October 29, 2023, it reached a brightness of approximately magnitude 9.</li>
    <li>It experiences a radial acceleration of about 135 kilometers per day squared.</li>
    <li>Transverse acceleration measures roughly 60 kilometers per day squared.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The object was classified as a comet due to its outgassing behavior.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2023, during its perihelion, 3I/ATLAS was obscured from Earth’s view by the Sun. Despite this, observations from multiple space-based instruments indicated a significant increase in brightness and a color change to a distinct blue.</p>
<p>Post-perihelion observations are expected to provide further data on the object’s behavior and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The acceleration patterns observed are not solely due to gravitational forces,” said Davide Farnocchia, a navigation engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “This indicates active cometary processes.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed by astronomers, following notable discoveries such as 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These objects have sparked interest in studying the origins and compositions of materials from beyond our solar system.</p>
<p>The unique acceleration patterns and color changes observed in 3I/ATLAS challenge existing models of comet behavior and highlight the need for ongoing research into interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS through ground-based observatories and space-based platforms. Observations in November and December 2023 are crucial for understanding the object’s mass loss and behavior as it returns to interstellar space.</p>
