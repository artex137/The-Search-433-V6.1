      <h2>Latest update on 3I/ATLAS: Interstellar comet is getting brighter</h2>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching the inner solar system and has exhibited increased brightness and activity, according to recent observations. The comet was first identified by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) station in Río Hurtado, Chile, in July 2023, and has since been a topic of interest in the astronomy community.</p>

<p>The brightness of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it indicates heightened activity as the comet nears the Sun. Scientists are monitoring its behavior closely as comets can be unpredictable. The comet is expected to fly by Mars on October 3, 2023, providing an opportunity for further observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is moving through the solar system at a speed of <strong>60,000 km/second</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet will fly by Mars on <strong>October 3, 2023</strong>, at a distance of <strong>29 million kilometres</strong>.</li>
    <li>It will reach perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on <strong>October 29, 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will come nearest to Earth on <strong>December 19, 2025</strong>, at a distance of <strong>269 million km</strong>.</li>
    <li>NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) detected the comet in May 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet's brightness increased fivefold between <strong>May 7 and June 3, 2023</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted by the ATLAS station in July 2023. Following its discovery, astronomers noticed its unusual trajectory, indicating it originated from interstellar space. In May, TESS captured images of the comet, revealing a significant brightness increase.</p>
<p>As of mid-September 2023, observations show that 3I/ATLAS is brightening unexpectedly, suggesting it is becoming more active as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comets are known to behave unpredictably, so there is no way to know how 3I/ATLAS will behave,” said an unnamed astronomer.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated considerable interest due to its interstellar origin and unusual characteristics. While some scientists, including Harvard's Avi Loeb, have speculated about the possibility of it being an alien spacecraft, the broader scientific community maintains that it is a comet exhibiting atypical behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, various missions, including China's Tianwen-1, NASA, and ESA's Trace Gas Orbiter, will conduct observations to gather more data on the comet’s activity and characteristics.</p>
