      <h2>NASA group launches defense probe to protect Earth from Manhattan-sized comet</h2>

<p>A NASA-backed planetary defense group has begun efforts to track comet 3I/ATLAS, which has been observed emitting an alloy not seen in nature. The comet, measuring approximately 28 miles across, has raised concerns due to its unusual behaviors. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has included 3I/ATLAS among potential threats to Earth, marking it as the first interstellar object to be targeted for monitoring.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it aims to enhance detection skills and prepare for potential threats from beyond the solar system. IAWN has scheduled a “comet campaign” from November 27, 2025, through January 27, 2026, to refine methods for accurately locating 3I/ATLAS. The campaign comes as the comet is nearing its closest approach to the Sun, after which it will become harder to observe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS first photographed by the Hubble Telescope on July 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>IAWN plans a comet campaign from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet emits a plume containing four grams of nickel per second.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS displays an anti-tail and non-gravitational acceleration.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to measure 28 miles across.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 21, 2025, by the Hubble Telescope. Following its discovery, researchers noted its unusual characteristics, including the emission of nickel tetracarbonyl and an anti-tail. The comet has been classified as a potential threat by IAWN, prompting preparations for a comet campaign set to begin in late November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To prepare for the campaign, we will hold a workshop on techniques to correctly measure comet astrometry,” IAWN representatives stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, commented, “If 3I/ATLAS is a massive mothership, it will likely continue along its original gravitational path and ultimately exit the Solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS has raised alarms within the scientific community due to its unconventional behavior, which defies typical comet characteristics. Previous interstellar objects have prompted discussions about planetary defense, underscoring the need for improved monitoring techniques as space exploration continues to advance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>IAWN will conduct the comet campaign to enhance detection capabilities and gather more data on 3I/ATLAS. Further observations will be crucial as the comet approaches the Sun and subsequently becomes less visible.</p>
