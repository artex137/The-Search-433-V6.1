      <h2>'Completely unexplained': James Webb telescope finds strange 'dark beads' in Saturn's atmosphere</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered unusual "dark beads" in Saturn's atmosphere, located above a hexagonal storm at the planet's north pole. The findings were published on August 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it presents unexpected structures that challenge current understanding of Saturn's atmospheric dynamics. Researchers aim to conduct follow-up observations to investigate the potential interactions between Saturn's magnetosphere and atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery made by the James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec).</li>
    <li>Dark beads located above Saturn's hexagonal storm, approximately 684 miles (1,100 km) above the planet's surface.</li>
    <li>Publication date of findings: August 28, 2023.</li>
    <li>Hexagonal storm's diameter: 29,000 kilometers (18,000 miles).</li>
    <li>Next observation opportunity: Saturn's equinox on September 21, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1980, NASA's Voyager spacecraft first discovered Saturn's hexagon. The Cassini spacecraft later provided detailed imaging from 2004 to 2017. The JWST has now revealed new features above this hexagonal storm, which were unexpected and have not been previously observed.</p>

<p>During its observations, JWST tracked positively-charged hydrogen molecules (H3+) and methane in Saturn's ionosphere, revealing the strange bead-like structures. Researchers believe these beads may result from complex interactions between the planet's magnetosphere and atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The results came as a complete surprise,” said Tom Stallard, a professor of astronomy at Northumbria University in the U.K. “These features were completely unexpected and, at present, are completely unexplained.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We think that the dark beads may result from complex interactions between Saturn's magnetosphere and its rotating atmosphere, potentially providing new insights into the energy exchange that drives Saturn's aurora,” Stallard added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Saturn's hexagonal storm has been a subject of interest since its discovery, with scientists exploring its unique properties and the gas dynamics involved. The JWST findings add a new layer of complexity and highlight the need for further research into the planet's atmospheric behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research team plans to conduct follow-up observations with JWST to better understand the features and their implications for Saturn's atmosphere, especially as the planet approaches its equinox.</p>
