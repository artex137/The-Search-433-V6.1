      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS triggers Stephen Hawking’s warnings about alien contacts with unusual composition</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object in the Solar System, was detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet follows a hyperbolic trajectory at 60 km/s and reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 210 million kilometers from the Sun. Its unusual chemical composition, including nickel vapors, carbon dioxide, and water ice, has revived warnings from physicist Stephen Hawking regarding potential risks of interactions with advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. According to NASA and ESA, the comet poses no threat to Earth as it approaches at least 270 million kilometers in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Travels at a speed of 60 km/s.</li>
    <li>Passed near Mars on October 3, 2025, at a distance of 30 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Estimated age ranges from 7.6 to 14 billion years.</li>
    <li>International Asteroid Warning Network coordinates monitoring until January 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. Initial observations indicated its potential classification as an asteroid, but further imaging revealed cometary activity. By July 21, 2025, Hubble observations confirmed a core size ranging from 440 meters to 5.6 kilometers. The comet passed close to Mars on October 3, 2025, providing opportunities for imaging by probes such as ExoMars and Mars Express. It reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, and is expected to pass Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The arrival of 3I/ATLAS, with materials from distant systems, reinforces fears about contacts with advanced civilizations,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Contacts with advanced civilizations could resemble colonial invasions on Earth,” warned Stephen Hawking in 2010, advocating for cosmic silence to avoid detection.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Stephen Hawking's warnings date back to 2010 when he cautioned about the risks of revealing humanity's existence to advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. The detection of 3I/ATLAS, with its unique chemical composition, has reignited discussions about the implications of such cosmic visitors. The comet's features, including its unusual ratios of carbon dioxide to water ice, have drawn attention from astronomers and researchers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The International Asteroid Warning Network will oversee observations until January 2026, while the ESA plans a Comet Interceptor mission in 2029 to study similar celestial visitors.</p>
