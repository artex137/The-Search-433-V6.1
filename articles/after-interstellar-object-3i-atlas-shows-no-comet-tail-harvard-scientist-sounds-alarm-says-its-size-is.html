      <h2>Harvard scientist raises concerns over interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is roughly the size of Manhattan, has surprised scientists once more as new images reveal it has no cometary tail. Photographs captured by the R. Naves Observatory in Spain on November 5 show no signs of debris typically expected to trail behind such an object as it approaches the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery has intensified discussions among scientists about the true nature of 3I/ATLAS. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet could pose a threat to humanity, describing it as potentially being a piece of extraterrestrial technology. NASA has dismissed his claims, emphasizing the need for further research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: Estimated to be one or two city blocks in width</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Predicted to pass approximately 267 million kilometres in December</li>
    <li>Date of photograph: November 5, 2023</li>
    <li>Location of observation: R. Naves Observatory, Spain</li>
    <li>Key scientist: Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li>Nasa's response: Dismissed claims made by Loeb</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 5, 2023, the R. Naves Observatory in Spain captured new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing the absence of a cometary tail. This finding sparked renewed interest in the object, which has been under scrutiny since its discovery.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has previously raised concerns about anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS. In an interview with The Times of Israel, he compared the object to the first known interstellar object, ‘Oumuamua, which he also described as having unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “For a typical comet, passing the sun should have resulted in a massive coma with dust and gas that would have been pushed by the solar radiation pressure and the solar wind to the shape of a typical cometary tail pointing away from the Sun,” said Loeb.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “This offers a clean test of the nature of 3I/ATLAS in the coming weeks,” he added. “If 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, it should be surrounded by a massive cloud of gas that carries at least 13 percent of the original nucleus mass.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. Its unusual characteristics have drawn comparisons to ‘Oumuamua, which was discovered in 2017. Loeb has noted that both objects exhibit anomalies that challenge traditional understanding of comets.</p>

<p>The scientific community continues to debate the implications of such findings, especially regarding the possibility of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As researchers continue to study 3I/ATLAS, further observations will be critical. The scientific community will monitor the object closely to determine whether it produces a cometary tail, which could provide insight into its composition and nature.</p>
