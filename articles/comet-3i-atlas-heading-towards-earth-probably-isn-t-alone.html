      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Heading Towards Earth Probably Isn’t Alone</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that the rare comet 3I/ATLAS is likely not alone as it travels through our solar system, with more interstellar visitors expected in the near future. This revelation comes as the comet is set to pass Mars next month and make its closest approach to Earth, although it will be obscured from view as it travels behind the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that interstellar objects may be more common than previously thought. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which has recently begun its Legacy Survey of Space and Time, is expected to play a key role in identifying these objects. Aster Taylor, a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, noted that the observatory's capabilities could lead to numerous new discoveries over the next decade.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass Mars next month before approaching Earth.</li>
    <li>The Rubin Observatory has already discovered over 2,100 new asteroids in its commissioning phase.</li>
    <li>The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Rubin Observatory has a 3.2 gigapixel camera.</li>
    <li>Some studies predict the discovery of 1-2 interstellar objects per year, while others suggest up to 70 per year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, the Rubin Observatory entered its commissioning phase and successfully discovered more than 2,100 new asteroids. During this period, it also detected 3I/ATLAS a few days before its official discovery by NASA. The observatory is designed to map the Milky Way and study cosmic evolution, with its large camera capable of capturing significant portions of the night sky each week.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, it will pass Mars next month and approach Earth, although the closest view will be obscured as it travels behind the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Aster Taylor, Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan:</blockquote>
<p>“We expect to discover many more interstellar objects in the coming decades, as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time is underway.”</p>

<blockquote>Aster Taylor:</blockquote>
<p>“Having ~15 would be a massive improvement in the sample size and vastly improve our understanding of interstellar objects’ composition, ages, and dynamics.”</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the few interstellar objects observed, highlighting the potential of advanced detection methods to reveal more such visitors. The Rubin Observatory aims to enhance our understanding of these objects, which could shift our knowledge of their frequency and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Rubin Observatory will continue its survey to detect interstellar objects and enhance our understanding of their composition and behavior. As the survey progresses, astronomers expect to gain insights into the nature of these celestial visitors.</p>
