      <h2>Explainer: 3I/ATLAS, a celestial visitor offering rare glimpse of another star system</h2>

<p>A comet from beyond our solar system, known as 3I/ATLAS, has passed Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 270 million km. This marks the third confirmed interstellar object discovered, according to astronomers. The comet, measuring only a few miles across, is not visible to the naked eye and will not return, making this a unique observational opportunity.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its ability to provide scientists with insights into material formed around a star other than our Sun. Authorities, including NASA and various astronomical observatories, are actively studying the comet’s composition and trajectory to enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 270 million km</li>
    <li>Size: a few miles across</li>
    <li>Number of interstellar objects discovered: three</li>
    <li>First observed: June 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The journey of 3I/ATLAS began in June 2025 when the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile captured faint images of the object. Initially, it appeared to be a small smudge of light. However, astronomers soon realized its high speed and elongated path indicated it was not gravitationally bound to the Sun, confirming it as an interstellar visitor.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approached the inner solar system in late summer, telescopes such as Gemini South captured detailed images of its expanding coma and tail. Observations from Hubble, TESS, NASA’s SPHEREx, and the James Webb Space Telescope followed, providing a wealth of data about this unique comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet is a messenger from another solar system and another era of cosmic history,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, astronomers had identified two interstellar objects: ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Unlike these earlier objects, 3I/ATLAS is definitively a comet, showcasing unique chemical properties and a distinct tail formation.</p>

<p>This comet has shown unusual characteristics, including a high carbon dioxide-to-water ratio and an unexpected backward tail pointing toward the Sun, raising questions about its formation and the conditions in its original planetary system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data collected from various telescopes to further understand the composition and origin of 3I/ATLAS. This research may yield insights into the formation of other planetary systems and the nature of ancient cosmic materials.</p>
