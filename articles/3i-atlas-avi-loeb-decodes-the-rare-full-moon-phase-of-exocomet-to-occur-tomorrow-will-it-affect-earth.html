      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Avi Loeb Decodes The Rare ‘Full Moon Phase’ Of Exocomet To Occur Tomorrow; Will It Affect Earth?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to enter a rare opposition phase, aligning with the Earth and Sun on January 22, 2026, at 5 a.m. IST. This event marks a unique “full moon phase” for the interstellar comet, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</p>

<p>The significance of this alignment lies in its potential to enhance the brightness of 3I/ATLAS, which could provide valuable data on its composition and structure. Loeb's recent blog post details how observers on Earth will witness this event due to a minimal misalignment of just 0.69 degrees. He emphasizes that this rare occurrence offers a unique opportunity to study the comet's opposition surge and polarimetric properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: January 22, 2026 (EST) or January 23, 2026 (IST)</li>
    <li>Time of alignment: 5 a.m. IST</li>
    <li>Misalignment angle: 0.69 degrees (0.012 radians)</li>
    <li>Research paper co-authors: Avi Loeb and Mauro Barbieri</li>
    <li>Notable feature: Three symmetrical jets extending 25,000 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In his preprint paper, Loeb outlines the mechanics of the opposition surge, which occurs when the Sun, the comet, and the observer align closely. This alignment minimizes shadows cast by dust particles, enhancing the comet's brightness. The researchers also reference past observations of a similar surge from the comet 67P/C-G, which was studied by the Rosetta spacecraft.</p>

<p>Loeb has identified 18 anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, including the newly discovered symmetrical jets. He states that the high velocity of the comet, combined with solar wind and radiation, prevents harmful materials from reaching Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When taking into account the large velocity of 3I/ATLAS relative to the Sun, supplemented by the pushback from the solar wind and radiation, the material carried by the anti-tail, including the poisonous cyanide, has no chance of reaching the Earth and affecting our life,” said Avi Loeb in his blog.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This upcoming alignment is significant as it allows for advanced observation techniques, including photometry and polarimetry. These methods can yield insights into the nature of interstellar cometary dust, which has been a topic of interest in astrophysics.</p>

<p>Previous studies of comets have also revealed important data about their characteristics, but 3I/ATLAS presents unique observational advantages due to its alignment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the alignment on January 22, researchers plan to conduct a series of observations to gather data on the comet's properties and anomalies. This research aims to maximize the information obtained from 3I/ATLAS during this rare event.</p>
