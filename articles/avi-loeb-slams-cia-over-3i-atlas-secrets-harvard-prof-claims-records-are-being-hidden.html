      <h2>Avi Loeb Slams CIA Over 3I/ATLAS Secrets: Harvard Prof Claims Records Are Being Hidden</h2>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has criticized the CIA for its silence regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, following NASA's classification of the object as a natural comet. The controversy emerged after the CIA did not acknowledge the existence of records related to 3I/ATLAS when approached for information, raising questions about the agency's level of secrecy.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights a discrepancy between scientific consensus and intelligence community responses. Loeb argues that the CIA's lack of transparency is puzzling if 3I/ATLAS is indeed a harmless comet, suggesting that the agency may be concealing information in anticipation of an unforeseen event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>NASA classified 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet on 19 November 2025.</li>
  <li>The CIA issued a Glomar response to a FOIA request on 31 December 2025, neither confirming nor denying the existence of records.</li>
  <li>Loeb has identified unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including a unique anti-tail jet and an unusual chemical composition.</li>
  <li>The object’s trajectory aligns closely with the 1977 'Wow! signal', with a probability of 0.6 per cent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 19 November 2025, NASA publicly stated that 3I/ATLAS is 'definitely a comet of natural origin' during a press conference. The situation escalated when researcher John Greenewald Jr submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the CIA on 31 December 2025. The CIA responded with a Glomar response, which does not confirm or deny the existence of requested records.</p>

<p>Loeb has since raised concerns about the object’s behavior, which he believes contradicts the standard understanding of cometary physics. He has called for ongoing monitoring of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter to determine if it exhibits any technological behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The CIA's silence is baffling if the object is truly mundane,” said Loeb, emphasizing the need for transparency from the agency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also noted, “We must continue to monitor the object as it moves near Jupiter to avoid missing a discovery that could change human history.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident underscores ongoing tensions between scientific inquiry and government secrecy. Previous instances of classified information have raised public concern over the transparency of intelligence agencies. Loeb's comments reflect a broader debate about the implications of unidentified objects in space and their potential significance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb advocates for further investigation into 3I/ATLAS and the CIA's records. The scientific community is urged to continue monitoring the object for any signs of technological behavior or anomalies as it approaches Jupiter.</p>
