      <h2>Interstellar Comet Grows Tail As It Hurtles Towards Earth</h2>

<p>A comet known as 3I-Atlas is becoming more active as it travels through our solar system, currently located 238 million miles from Earth. Experts at the National Science Foundation's NoirLab have reported that the comet's tail is growing larger and more pronounced since its last observation in August. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This comet's increasing activity is significant because it marks the third interstellar object identified to have entered our solar system. Authorities, including NASA, are closely monitoring its trajectory as it approaches the sun in October and continues toward Earth until December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I-Atlas is currently 238 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass the sun in October 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be 167 million miles away.</li>
    <li>The comet has been monitored with the Gemini South telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>This is believed to be only the third interstellar object identified by scientists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Experts have observed the comet's activity increase since August 2025. Images released this week show its growing tail of dust and gas. The comet is expected to pass the sun in October, continuing its path toward Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Images released this week show a tail of dust and gas following the comet’s trajectory that has only grown larger and more pronounced,” said experts at the National Science Foundation's NoirLab.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I-Atlas is notable as only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following previous discoveries that have provided insight into the composition and dynamics of celestial bodies from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to track 3I-Atlas as it approaches the sun and Earth, with updates expected as its trajectory becomes clearer in the coming months.</p>
