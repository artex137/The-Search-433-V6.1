      <h2>Cult Belgian UFO memorial removed at request of spotter’s family</h2>

<p>A roadside memorial in Lottenhulle, Belgium, has been removed at the request of the family of Marin Vandercruyssen, who created it. The memorial, erected in 2004, commemorated a UFO sighting that Vandercruyssen experienced in 1955 while serving as a paratrooper in the Belgian Army.</p>

<p>The removal of the monument highlights changing sentiments surrounding the UFO sighting and its legacy. According to local reports, Vandercruyssen's family, who have distanced themselves from the event, requested the local council to remove the memorial, stating they “no longer wanted to be associated with the sighting.”</p>
