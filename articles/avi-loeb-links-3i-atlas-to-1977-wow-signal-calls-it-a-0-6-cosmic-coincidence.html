      <h2>Avi Loeb Links 3I/ATLAS to 1977 Wow Signal—Calls It a '0.6% Cosmic Coincidence'</h2>

<p>Renowned Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has suggested a connection between the mysterious 1977 'Wow! Signal' and the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, during a recent discussion. Loeb, head of the Galileo Project, revealed that the two events occurred in proximity to each other, with 3I/ATLAS approaching from a region just 9 degrees away from the signal's source.</p>

<p>This connection is significant as it raises questions about the nature of the 'Wow! Signal', which has puzzled scientists for nearly five decades. Loeb calculates the probability of this alignment to be a mere <strong>0.6%</strong>, suggesting that further investigation into this potential link is warranted.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object, a term for celestial bodies that pass through the solar system from other star systems.</li>
    <li>The 'Wow! Signal' was detected by a radio telescope in Ohio in 1977 and lasted <strong>72 seconds</strong>.</li>
    <li>The signal has never been detected again despite numerous attempts.</li>
    <li>Loeb noted that the signal's power could be equivalent to that of a standard nuclear reactor, around <strong>one gigawatt</strong>.</li>
    <li>Loeb argues for the importance of searching for 'technosignatures' from advanced civilizations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1977, a radio telescope in Ohio detected a powerful radio signal lasting 72 seconds, later dubbed the 'Wow! Signal'. For decades, the origin of this signal has remained a mystery. Recently, Avi Loeb has drawn attention to the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which approached our solar system from a direction near the source of the 'Wow! Signal'. Loeb's analysis suggests that this alignment is a rare coincidence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The probability of these two distinct, significant events aligning so closely by sheer chance is incredibly slim, at just 0.6%,” said Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The 'Wow! Signal' was not a typical cosmic blip. It was an enigmatic, powerful radio signal that definitely came from outside of this Earth,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 'Wow! Signal' remains one of the most intriguing phenomena in radio astronomy. Despite numerous attempts to locate it again, the signal has never reappeared. Loeb’s recent observations reflect a growing interest in the potential for discovering evidence of extraterrestrial life and advanced civilizations, which he believes has often been overlooked by the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb's assertion encourages further investigation into the relationship between 3I/ATLAS and the 'Wow! Signal'. He advocates for a more open mindset within the scientific community regarding unexplained phenomena.</p>
