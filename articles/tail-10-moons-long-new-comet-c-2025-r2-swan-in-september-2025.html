      <h2>Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN Appears in the Night Sky</h2>
<p>A new comet, C/2025 R2 SWAN, has been discovered on September 11, 2025, by Ukrainian amateur astronomer Vladimir Bezugly. The comet has already developed a tail measuring approximately 5° and is currently best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere. Observers in the Northern Hemisphere may see it in October. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the arrival of a non-periodic comet that will not return for over 20,000 years. The comet has reached a brightness of magnitude 7 to 6.5, making it visible with binoculars. Astronomers are actively monitoring its progress and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> September 11, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> September 12, 2025, at a distance of 0.504 AU from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> October 19, 2025, at 0.261 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> Currently around 7; may brighten to magnitude 4</li>
    <li><strong>Visible from:</strong> Southern Hemisphere; Northern Hemisphere after closest approach</li>
    <li><strong>Tail length:</strong> Approximately 10 Full Moons lined up in the sky</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, several key events have occurred:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>September 12:</strong> Reached perihelion, brightness at magnitude 7.2</li>
    <li><strong>September 15:</strong> Passed 20' from Spica</li>
    <li><strong>September 20:</strong> Passed just over 1° from Mars</li>
    <li><strong>September 28:</strong> Entered the constellation Libra</li>
</ul>
<p>In October, the comet will be visible from the Northern Hemisphere, appearing low above the southwestern horizon at dusk.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was very pleasantly surprised by such a bright comet with a long tail – I originally expected to be searching for a small, faint patch,” said Martin Mašek from the Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Vladimir Bezugly noted, “From my memory, this comet is one of the brightest among all comets we’ve ever discovered in SWAN images.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN is categorized as a non-periodic comet, meaning it may only pass through the inner Solar System once or take over 200 years to complete its orbit. It was initially designated SWAN25B before receiving its official name from the International Astronomical Union.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to track the comet's trajectory and brightness as it approaches Earth. Observers should prepare for potential meteor showers as Earth may pass through the comet’s debris stream between October 4 and 6.</p>
