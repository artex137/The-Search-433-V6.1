      <h2>UFO or airship? Viral video captures massive white object over San Francisco</h2>

<p>A large white airship identified as Pathfinder 1 floated over San Francisco on Tuesday morning, leaving residents intrigued and confused but causing no reported injuries or fatalities. The incident prompted widespread online speculation and viral videos as witnesses captured the unusual sight.</p>

<p>The Pathfinder 1 is a zero-emission airship operated by Lighter Than Air (LTA) Research, a company founded by Google co-founder Sergey Brin. The airship was conducting a test flight as part of ongoing research into eco-friendly aviation and sustainable cargo transport, according to NBC News. The sighting has raised interest in potential advancements in aviation technology and environmental sustainability.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Pathfinder 1 airship sighting</li>
    <li>Date: Tuesday morning</li>
    <li>Location: San Francisco, Oakland, and Alameda</li>
    <li>Company: Lighter Than Air (LTA) Research</li>
    <li>Founder: Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google</li>
    <li>First flight: May 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Tuesday morning, San Francisco residents spotted a large airship gliding across the skyline. The sighting led to a surge of social media activity, particularly after content creator César Concepción Salza posted a video on Instagram showing the airship. The video quickly gained traction on various platforms, including X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit.</p>

<p>As the day progressed, witnesses reported seeing the airship not only in San Francisco but also in nearby Oakland and Alameda. The airship was eventually identified as Pathfinder 1, part of LTA Research's efforts to innovate in aviation technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What is this in the San Francisco sky today?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Only in San Francisco — where even the blimps are powered by Google money and good intentions.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pathfinder 1 is part of a larger initiative by LTA Research to develop zero-emission airships, which could significantly reduce the carbon footprint of transportation. The airship was constructed in Hangar Two at Moffett Federal Airfield in Mountain View, California, and represents a modern approach to lighter-than-air aviation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>LTA Research will continue its test flights of the Pathfinder 1 as part of its mission to advance sustainable aviation technology. Further developments and public demonstrations may follow as the project progresses.
