      <h2>'Miracle' photo captures Comet Lemmon and meteor seemingly entwined over Earth</h2>

<p>An astronomer in Manciano, Italy, has captured a remarkable photograph of Comet Lemmon appearing to entwine with a meteor's glowing trail on the night of October 24. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This photo is significant as it presents a rare visual phenomenon, showcasing the beauty and complexity of celestial events. Authorities in the field of astronomy are taking note of this occurrence, which highlights the interaction between comets and meteors in our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 24, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li>Astronomer: Gianluca Masi, founder of The Virtual Telescope Project</li>
    <li>Distance of Comet Lemmon: approximately 100 million kilometers (62 million miles) from Earth</li>
    <li>Speed of meteors: typically more than 100,000 mph (160,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Duration of meteor trails: can linger for several minutes</li>
    <li>Peak of the Orionid meteor shower: October 20-21, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 21, Comet Lemmon reached its closest point to Earth, becoming the brightest comet visible in the night sky. Following this, on October 24, Gianluca Masi aimed his telescope at the sky above Manciano and captured the image of the comet and meteor. During his observations, he noted a golden line spiraling around the comet, which was identified as the ion trail from a meteor entering Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>Masi later described the event as a "pure perspective miracle," emphasizing the unlikely alignment of the comet and meteor in the sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "In this photograph, the meteor's afterglow appears to coil around the comet's ion tail — a pure perspective miracle," said Gianluca Masi.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "The phenomenon is associated with the ionization of molecular oxygen in the atmosphere caused by the meteor event," Masi added, explaining the science behind the glowing trail.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of spiral meteor trails is considered relatively rare. Studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s estimated that only 0.5% of observed meteors leave nonlinear trails. The recent peak of the Orionid meteor shower, which is related to the debris from Halley's Comet, provided an ideal backdrop for this rare sighting.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the Orionid meteor shower continues until November 7, astronomers encourage the public to watch for more meteor activity in the nights ahead. Observations like Masi's highlight the dynamic interactions between celestial bodies in our solar system.</p>
