      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals straight tail and compact nucleus in astronomer’s unprecedented image</h2>

<p>Japanese astronomer Mitsunori Tsumura has captured an unprecedented image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on November 22, 2025, revealing a straight tail and compact nucleus that challenge conventional comet models. The observation was part of a global campaign initiated after the comet was discovered by the ATLAS monitoring system in July 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises new questions about the composition and origin of 3I/ATLAS, which is believed to have originated from outside the Solar System. Scientists from around the world are currently analyzing the material ejected by the comet to understand the differences in its formation compared to comets within our Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The image was captured on November 22, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's tail remains narrow and collimated, unlike typical comets.</li>
    <li>Estimates suggest the nucleus may range from 440 meters to 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a velocity of 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>It is projected to pass within 53.5 million kilometers of Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS monitoring system discovered comet 3I/ATLAS, triggering a global observation campaign. By November 22, 2025, astronomer Mitsunori Tsumura captured a detailed image of the comet, showcasing its straight tail and compact nucleus.</p>
<p>Subsequent analysis has indicated that the comet's tail does not exhibit the expected curvature typically seen in comets due to solar wind interactions. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have prompted scientists to investigate its material composition and formation mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The anomalies observed in 3I/ATLAS, such as its perfectly straight tail and symmetrical coma, suggest it is composed of materials with properties distinct from those found in comets in our Solar System,” said Tsumura.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar visitors, including comet 2I/Borisov, also exhibited unusual structures, but 3I/ATLAS displays an even greater degree of linearity in its tail. This indicates a possible denser composition or more controlled material ejection dynamics than expected for typical comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and analyze the ejected material to gain insights into its formation. Further observations are expected to clarify the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and its implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
