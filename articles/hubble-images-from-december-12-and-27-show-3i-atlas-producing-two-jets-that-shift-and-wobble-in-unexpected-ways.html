      <h2>Hubble Images Show Comet 3I/ATLAS Emitting Two Jets</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing two distinct jets of material on December 12 and December 27, 2025. These jets are behaving unexpectedly as the comet travels away from the Sun, according to analysis by astronomers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing models of comet behavior and raises questions about the internal structure of 3I/ATLAS. Astronomers are investigating whether these observations fit within known comet physics or indicate a more complex phenomenon at work.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observations made on: December 12 and December 27, 2025</li>
    <li>Instrument: Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3</li>
    <li>Key findings: Two jets—one strong and one weak—exhibiting unusual stability</li>
    <li>Analysis by: Avi Loeb</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 12, 2025, Hubble captured images showing the first evidence of a strong jet emanating from 3I/ATLAS. By December 27, the second jet was also observed, leading to the identification of a “double-jet” configuration. Earlier images from July 2025 had already indicated the presence of a sun-facing jet, which was long and stable but exhibited slight wobbling.</p>

<p>As the comet reached its closest point to the Sun in late October 2025, its trajectory was altered only modestly by gravity, allowing for continued observation of its jet activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The consistency between the December 12 and December 27 observations strengthens confidence that the double-jet pattern is real and not an imaging artifact,” said Avi Loeb in his analysis.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the rarest objects observed in our solar system, classified as an interstellar visitor. This object's behavior is significant for understanding how material behaves when influenced by solar heating. Previous observations of comets have typically shown a single jet from the sunlit side, making 3I/ATLAS’s double-jet configuration noteworthy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As analysis of 3I/ATLAS continues, astronomers will study its behavior to refine models of comet physics and interstellar material dynamics. Further observations may provide insights into its internal structure and long-term activity cycle.</p>
