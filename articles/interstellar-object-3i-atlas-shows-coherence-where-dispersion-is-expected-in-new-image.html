      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Shows 'Coherence Where Dispersion Is Expected' In New Image</h2>

<p>A new image of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, officially designated C/2025 N1, has sparked significant debate among astronomers. The object, first spotted on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Rio Hurtado, Chile, has exhibited unusual structural features that challenge existing scientific models.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it may reshape our understanding of the characteristics and behaviour of interstellar objects. The image, captured during 3I/ATLAS’s closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, shows anomalies that complicate the traditional view of comets as simple 'dirty snowballs' or rocky bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>First observed: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025, at a distance of 168 million miles</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: Between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 153,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: 29 October 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was first detected by astronomers in Chile. The object continued to be monitored as it approached the Sun, reaching its perihelion on 29 October 2025. Following this, it came within 168 million miles of Earth on 19 December 2025, during which a new image was captured that revealed its unique structural features.</p>

<p>As astronomers analysed the new data, they noted that the light from 3I/ATLAS behaved differently than expected, showing sharp boundaries and discrete luminous points that suggest a solid structure rather than a typical cometary coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The clarity, the geometry, and the sheer strangeness of the light reflecting off this object suggest we are looking at something far more complex than a simple chunk of ice,” said an astronomer involved in the investigation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Previous interstellar objects have also generated discussions regarding the nature of such bodies, but the structural anomalies observed in 3I/ATLAS have prompted calls for a reevaluation of existing scientific frameworks.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As more high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS are expected to surface, astronomers will continue to analyse the data. The investigation into the object's unusual properties is likely to evolve, potentially leading to significant advancements in our understanding of interstellar bodies.</p>
