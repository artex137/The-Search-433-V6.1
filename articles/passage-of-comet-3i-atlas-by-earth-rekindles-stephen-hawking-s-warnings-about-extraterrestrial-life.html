      <h2>Passage of comet 3I/ATLAS by Earth rekindles Stephen Hawking’s warnings about extraterrestrial life</h2>

<p>The recent passage of comet 3I/ATLAS through our solar system has reignited discussions about the potential risks of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations. Detected for the first time in July 2025 by the ATLAS astronomical survey system in Chile, the comet confirmed its interstellar origin due to its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun.</p>

<p>Authorities have closely monitored the comet since its discovery, with space agencies such as NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) actively observing its path. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 30, 2025, at a safe distance of 210 million kilometers. However, its unusual chemical composition has prompted scientists to revisit theories proposed by physicist Stephen Hawking regarding the implications of encountering advanced alien technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected in July 2025 by ATLAS in Chile.</li>
  <li>Perihelion reached on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
  <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred in December 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
  <li>Estimated travel time through the Milky Way: 7.6 to 14 billion years.</li>
  <li>Observations revealed the presence of water ice, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nickel vapors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS astronomical survey system in Chile. The object’s hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its interstellar origin. On October 30, 2025, the comet reached perihelion at a distance of 210 million kilometers from the Sun. Its closest approach to Earth occurred in December 2025, at around 270 million kilometers. Throughout this period, NASA and ESA conducted extensive monitoring and analysis of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS did not pose any threat of collision with Earth,” said a spokesperson for NASA. “Its orbit kept it at a safe distance throughout its passage.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third verified interstellar object to visit our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and comet Borisov. The unusual nature of 3I/ATLAS has prompted speculation about its origin, echoing debates surrounding ‘Oumuamua. Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has suggested that anomalies in the comet's brightness or trajectory could indicate signs of advanced technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue into early 2026, with ESA’s Juice probe directed to observe the comet as it moves away from the Sun and back into deep space. Further analysis of its chemical composition is expected to provide more insights into its origin and the implications of its findings.</p>
