      <h2>China 'shoots down meteor or UFO' as fireball blasts through sky before exploding</h2>

<p>A fireball has been spotted shooting through the skies above Shandong province, China, on Friday night, with social media users speculating that it was either a meteor or a UFO shot down by the Chinese military. The flaming object reportedly exploded mid-flight, but there have been no reports of injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This incident has sparked interest and concern among the public and experts alike, prompting discussions about potential missile tests and the implications for China's defense capabilities. Authorities have not yet issued an official statement regarding the event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on Friday night in Shandong province, China.</li>
    <li>Social media users reported seeing a fireball explode mid-flight.</li>
    <li>Locals claimed to have heard two loud bangs resembling artillery shells.</li>
    <li>Videos show the fireball being intercepted by a bright light in the sky.</li>
    <li>Claims of a missile test have not been confirmed by Chinese authorities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Friday night, a fireball was observed over Shandong province. Videos shared on social media depict a bright light approaching the fireball before it exploded. Witnesses reported hearing two loud bangs during the incident.</p>

<p>As videos circulated on social media, users speculated about the nature of the event, with some suggesting it could be a missile intercept test. Experts and analysts, including self-proclaimed UFO researcher Tom Thompson, provided their interpretations based on the footage.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Defense analysts say this fits a missile-intercept test,” said Tom Thompson on X. “A second light approached from another vector. They crossed, a flash lit the sky, and two sharp booms followed.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Astrophysics expert Dr Alfredo Carpineti commented, “The problem is that it partly looks like a meteor until it doesn’t. That’s why I’m sceptical.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows China's increasing focus on space defense, including plans to strike asteroids with spacecraft. The Chinese space program aims to enhance its capabilities in defending against potential asteroid threats, especially in light of the recent discovery of a "city killer" asteroid named 2024 YR4.</p>

<p>The asteroid, measuring between 40-100 metres wide, poses a risk of impacting Earth on December 22, 2032, according to predictions from the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the fireball incident are ongoing, and authorities are expected to release further information in the coming days. The public and experts will continue to monitor developments related to the event and its implications for China's defense strategies.</p>
