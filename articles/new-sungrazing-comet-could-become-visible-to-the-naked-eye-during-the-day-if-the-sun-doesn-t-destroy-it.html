      <h2>New 'sungrazing' comet could become visible to the naked eye during the day — if the sun doesn't destroy it</h2>

<p>A newly discovered sungrazing comet, C/2026 A1 (MAPS), is set to have a close encounter with the sun in early April 2024, potentially becoming bright enough to be seen without a telescope during the day, according to astronomers at the AMACS1 Observatory in Chile. The comet, which is approximately 2.4 kilometres wide, was first spotted on January 13, 2024.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it could offer a rare opportunity for observers to see a comet in daylight, depending on its survival of the intense conditions near the sun. Astronomers are monitoring C/2026 A1 closely as it approaches perihelion, its closest point to the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2026 A1 (MAPS) discovered on January 13, 2024.</li>
    <li>Perihelion on April 4, 2024, within 800,000 km of the sun.</li>
    <li>Estimated speed during perihelion: more than 3.2 million km/h.</li>
    <li>Potential maximum brightness: several times brighter than the full moon.</li>
    <li>Best visibility for observers in the Southern Hemisphere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>January 13, 2024: C/2026 A1 (MAPS) is discovered by astronomers at the AMACS1 Observatory in Chile.</p>
<p>April 4, 2024: The comet will reach its closest point to the sun, perihelion, and may become visible to the naked eye if it survives the encounter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it survives perihelion, C/2026 A1 will be so changed by the event that it will shine like an incredibly bright star.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>C/2026 A1 is part of the Kreutz family of sungrazing comets, which consists of over 3,500 comets. This group is believed to be fragments of a larger comet that broke apart around 1,700 years ago. Previous notable comets from this family include Comet Ikeya-Seki and Comet Lovejoy, both of which displayed extraordinary brightness during their solar flybys.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe C/2026 A1 as it approaches the sun, assessing its condition and brightness. If the comet survives perihelion, it may become visible in the days following its closest approach to the sun, especially as it nears Earth later in April.</p>
