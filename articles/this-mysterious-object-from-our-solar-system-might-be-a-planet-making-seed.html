      <h2>This Mysterious Object From Our Solar System Might Be a Planet-Making Seed</h2>

<p>A new theory has emerged regarding the comet 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it could play a significant role in planet formation. Astrophysicist Susanne Pfalzner proposed this idea during a planetary science conference in Germany. The comet, originating from deep interstellar space, has sparked debate among scientists about its potential impact on the formation of gas giants like Jupiter.</p>

<p>This theory is important because it offers an alternative explanation for how planets might form around young stars, challenging the traditional understanding of the process. Pfalzner's approach provides a fresh perspective on the role of interstellar objects in planetary formation, which could reshape current models in astrophysics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Presentation of a new theory regarding 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Location: Planetary science conference, Germany</li>
    <li>Key Proponent: Astrophysicist Susanne Pfalzner</li>
    <li>Object Type: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Potential Role: Key ingredient in the formation of gas giants</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At a recent planetary science conference in Germany, Susanne Pfalzner presented her theory regarding the comet 3I/ATLAS. She explained how interstellar objects might contribute to the rapid formation of planets around young stars, particularly gas giants. This presentation has sparked further interest and debate within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Higher-mass stars are more efficient in capturing interstellar objects in their discs. Therefore, interstellar object-seeded planet formation should be more efficient around these stars, providing a fast way to form giant planets. And, their fast formation is exactly what we have observed.”</blockquote> – Susanne Pfalzner

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Theories surrounding the formation of planets have traditionally focused on the process of accretion, where tiny particles combine to form larger bodies. However, Pfalzner's hypothesis addresses a gap in understanding how large planets can form quickly in certain star systems. Previous theories, including those proposed by Avi Loeb, have suggested more speculative ideas about 3I/ATLAS, including the possibility of it being an alien vessel.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further research and discussions are expected in the scientific community regarding Pfalzner's theory. This could lead to new investigations into the role of interstellar objects in planet formation and potentially reshape existing models in astrophysics.</p>
