      <h2>Mysterious Area 51 ‘unmanned aircraft’ crash probed by Air Force, FBI</h2>

<p>A crash involving an unmanned aircraft occurred on September 23 near Area 51 in Nevada, prompting investigations by the Air Force and the FBI. The incident took place on public land just outside the classified base at Groom Lake, approximately 133 kilometers north-northwest of Las Vegas. No injuries or fatalities have been reported, and recovery efforts concluded on September 27, according to the Air Force.</p>

<p>The crash has sparked weeks of speculation and allegations of a government cover-up. The Air Force has confirmed signs of tampering at the site, which has fueled rumors about the nature of the downed aircraft. A joint probe by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the FBI is currently underway, with officials yet to disclose the specific model of the aircraft involved.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on September 23, 2025.</li>
    <li>Location: Public land near Area 51, Nevada.</li>
    <li>Aircraft involved: Unmanned, assigned to the 432nd Wing.</li>
    <li>No reported injuries or fatalities.</li>

    <li>Temporary flight restriction issued by the FAA on the day of the crash.</li>
    <li>Investigation led by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the FBI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 23, a mysterious aircraft crash occurred near Area 51. Recovery operations began and were completed by September 27. Following the incident, the Air Force announced a base lockdown and flight restrictions were implemented due to national security concerns.</p>

<p>On October 3, investigators reported discovering signs of tampering at the crash site, including an inert training bomb and an aircraft panel of unknown origin. The FAA confirmed a temporary flight restriction over a five-nautical-mile area east of Area 51, which lasted until October 1.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We just had an asset go down. We had an asset go down,” said Joerg Arnu, an Area 51 researcher, recalling security chatter he overheard that morning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That’s absolutely bogus,” Arnu said regarding the Air Force's claims of unauthorized tampering with the crash scene.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 432nd Wing, based at Creech Air Force Base, operates unmanned aerial vehicles, including MQ-9 Reaper drones. The unit is also involved in testing next-generation UAVs designed to support advanced fighter jets. Previous incidents near Area 51 have similarly attracted attention and speculation about experimental military aircraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations by the Air Force and FBI are ongoing. No timeline for the completion of the investigation has been disclosed. Authorities are expected to provide further updates as new information becomes available.</p>
