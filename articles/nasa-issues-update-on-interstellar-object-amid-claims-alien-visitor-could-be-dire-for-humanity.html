      <h2>Nasa issues update on Comet 3I/Atlas amid claims of alien origins</h2>

<p>Nasa scientists have issued an update on Comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object moving through our solar system, following claims by a physicist that it could be a sign of extraterrestrial life. The comet has been under observation since it was first detected in July 2025.</p>

<p>This matter is significant because it raises questions about the nature of the object and its potential implications for Earth. Nasa has been closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics using various telescopes, while addressing claims that it may be artificially created.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Detection Date: July 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: 130,000 mph (209,215 km/h)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 170 million miles (273 million km)</li>
    <li>Key Commentator: Professor Avi Loeb, head of Harvard's Galileo Project</li>
    <li>Nasa Lead Scientist: Dr Tom Statler</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Comet 3I/Atlas was first detected as it entered the solar system. Nasa has since employed ground-based and space telescopes to gather data on the object. The comet is expected to pass close to Mars, Jupiter, and Venus but will not approach Earth closely.</p>

<p>Professor Avi Loeb published a scientific paper in July suggesting that Comet 3I/Atlas could be a "technological artefact" with "active intelligence." He raised concerns about the object potentially having "malign intent" towards Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Dr Tom Statler, Nasa's lead scientist for solar system small bodies:</strong> "It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know. The evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It is a comet."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Professor Avi Loeb:</strong> "Let us maintain our childhood curiosity and seek evidence rather than pretend to be the adults in the room that know the answers in advance. The hypothesis is an interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to pursue, irrespective of its likely validity."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This update follows a history of scientific debate regarding the origins of interstellar objects. Previous incidents have seen astronomers and physicists propose various theories about the nature of such bodies, often leading to public interest and speculation.</p>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is notable for its high speed and unusual trajectory, prompting discussions about its classification and potential implications for planetary safety.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches the inner solar system. Further observations and analyses are expected to provide more definitive insights into the object's nature and trajectory.</p>
