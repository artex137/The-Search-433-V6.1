      <h2>An interstellar comet is visiting our solar system this week: Here's how to get a glimpse of a rare appearance</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will fly by Earth on December 19, 2023, at a safe distance of approximately 170 million miles, according to NASA. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This flyby presents a unique opportunity for stargazers to observe the comet, which is considered rare. NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no danger to Earth during its approach. Observers can expect to see the comet in the predawn sky, with the best viewing conditions requiring a telescope or binoculars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li>Flyby date: December 19, 2023</li>
  <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 170 million miles</li>
  <li>Viewing time: predawn hours</li>
  <li>Location for viewing: east to northeast sky, under the star Regulus</li>
  <li>Virtual Telescope Project livestream: begins at 11 p.m. EST on December 18</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to pass by Earth on December 19, 2023. NASA has noted that the comet will be at a safe distance, roughly twice the distance between Earth and the sun.</p>
<p>For those interested in viewing the comet, binoculars or a telescope will enhance the experience. The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a livestream for those unable to observe it directly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA has made the assurance that Comet 3I/ATLAS will be of no danger to Earth during this pass.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is among a few interstellar comets that have been observed in recent years. Such events are significant for astronomers and stargazers alike, as they offer a glimpse into celestial phenomena rarely seen from Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Stargazers are encouraged to prepare for the comet's appearance on December 19 and to consider joining the Virtual Telescope Project's livestream for a more relaxed viewing experience.</p>
