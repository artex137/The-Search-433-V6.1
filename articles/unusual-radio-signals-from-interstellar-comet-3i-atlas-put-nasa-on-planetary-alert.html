      <h2>Unusual radio signals from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS put NASA on planetary alert</h2>

<p>The international astronomical community is on high alert following the detection of unusual radio emissions from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS astronomical survey system. The comet, a rare object from outside the Solar System, has prompted the Administração Nacional, Aeronáutica and Espaço (NASA) to initiate monitoring protocols for near-Earth objects.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it presents both a scientific opportunity and a test for global planetary defense systems. Authorities are mobilizing resources and coordinating efforts to study the comet's unique characteristics and its interactions with the solar wind.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at over 100,000 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Radio emissions detected on October 24, 2025, at a frequency of 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are collaborating on observation and analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers identified 3I/ATLAS as the third confirmed interstellar visitor. Following its discovery, NASA activated monitoring protocols for the comet. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected distinct radio emissions from the comet. These signals prompted a coordinated global response to study the comet's chemical composition and behavior.</p>

<p>The point of closest approach to Earth is anticipated on December 19, 2025, at a safe distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The intense activity offers a new window to study these objects. Radio astronomy allows us to investigate phenomena that optical observation cannot capture,” said a spokesperson for NASA’s Escritório de Coordenação de Defesa Planetária.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar visitors, ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. While ‘Oumuamua exhibited an elongated shape and lacked a visible coma, 2I/Borisov appeared as a more traditional comet. The unique radio activity of 3I/ATLAS adds complexity to the understanding of interstellar objects and their formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS and analyze data to gain insights into its internal structure and chemical composition. The international scientific community will collaborate to ensure continuous monitoring as the comet approaches Earth.</p>
