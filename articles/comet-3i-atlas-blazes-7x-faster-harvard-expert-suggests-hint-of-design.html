      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Blazes 7X Faster: Harvard Expert Suggests 'Hint of Design'</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has re-emerged from behind the sun and is exhibiting unusual behavior. The comet made its closest approach to the sun on Wednesday, observed by three NASA spacecraft after being hidden from view since 21 October. Researchers have noted that the comet is brightening at a rate approximately seven times faster than typical comets.</p>

<p>This unusual brightening raises questions among scientists about the comet's composition and behavior. Authorities, including researchers from Lowell Observatory and the US Naval Research Laboratory, are analyzing data from various sources to understand this phenomenon better.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the sun on Wednesday.</li>
    <li>The comet was hidden from view since 21 October.</li>
    <li>Data show it has brightened seven times faster than typical comets.</li>
    <li>NASA’s STEREO-A and SOHO spacecraft observed the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is enveloped in a coma approximately half the width of the full moon.</li>
    <li>A glowing plume extends nearly 186,000 miles around the object.</li>
    <li>It is expected to be visible in twilight and night skies during November and December.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 21 October, comet 3I/ATLAS was hidden from view as it passed behind the sun. On Wednesday, it made its closest approach, during which three NASA spacecraft captured observations. Researchers noted the comet's rapid brightening as it neared the sun, prompting further investigation.</p>

<p>As the comet approached, ground-based telescopes struggled to observe it due to the sun's glare. However, radio observations successfully detected large amounts of water-related molecules, indicating increased activity as the comet neared the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reason for 3I/ATLAS's rapid brightening... remains unclear,” researchers noted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard professor Avi Loeb stated, “This unfavorable geometry, a possible hint of design, placed the comet within the fields of view of several space-based solar coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, allowing continuous observation during its final approach to perihelion.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is a true interstellar comet, unlike typical long-period comets from the Oort cloud in our solar system. Its unique behavior has drawn the attention of scientists, who are eager to understand the underlying mechanisms of its rapid brightening and color change.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from the spacecraft and prepare for ground-based observations as the comet becomes visible in November and December. They aim to determine whether the comet continues to brighten or fades quickly after its perihelion passage.</p>
