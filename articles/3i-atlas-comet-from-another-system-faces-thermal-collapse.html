      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Comet from Another System Faces Thermal Collapse</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, identified as 3I/ATLAS, is at risk of collapsing due to intense heat from the Sun as it approaches perihelion, the closest point to the star, expected in 2026. Discovered in 2023, the comet is showing signs of instability, with astronomers expressing concern over its possible disintegration in the coming months.</p>

<p>This situation is significant because interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS are rare, crossing our solar system only a few times a century. Authorities, including NASA and ESA, are closely monitoring the comet's behavior, as its potential fragmentation could provide valuable data about the internal structure of comets and their origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is composed of ice and dust.</li>
  <li>It is currently traveling at a speed of 57 km/s.</li>
  <li>The comet was detected by the ATLAS project telescopes.</li>
  <li>Observations indicate fissures in its nucleus, suggesting possible fragmentation.</li>
  <li>Telescopes in Hawaii and Chile are tracking the comet.</li>
  <li>The risk of comet fragments reaching Earth is low.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2023 and has since been observed as it approaches perihelion. Recent observations have indicated an increase in gas release, a sign of warming and potential instability. As the comet nears the Sun, astronomers have detected fissures in its nucleus, raising concerns about its structural integrity.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to reach perihelion in 2026, at which point it will be subjected to extreme temperatures that could lead to its disintegration. Telescopes worldwide are currently monitoring the situation in real time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The possible disintegration of 3I/ATLAS could generate valuable data about the internal structure of comets,” said a spokesperson for NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its composition differs from local comets, suggesting different chemical processes in its system of origin. Such comets provide unique insights into the formation of distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring of 3I/ATLAS will intensify in the coming months, with astronomers aiming to capture detailed images of any potential fragmentations as it approaches perihelion.
