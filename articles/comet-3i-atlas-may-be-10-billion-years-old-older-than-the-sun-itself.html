      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS May Be 10 Billion Years Old — Older Than the Sun Itself</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, currently traversing the inner region of the Sun’s vicinity, may be as much as 10 billion years old, according to recent discussions among astronomers. This age potentially makes it older than the Sun itself, offering a unique insight into the early history of the galaxy.</p>

<p>The significance of this finding lies in its implications for our understanding of cosmic history. Astronomers are actively studying 3I/ATLAS, which might carry frozen material from before the Sun's formation. This research could enhance our knowledge of the early solar system and its formation from ancient stellar material.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS could be over 10 billion years old.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently moving through the Sun's inner region.</li>
    <li>Scientists estimate it originated from a star at least 8 billion years old.</li>
    <li>Research indicates it may contain significant amounts of water ice.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to produce a visible tail as it approaches the Sun in 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, New Scientist reported that astronomers had identified the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as potentially the oldest comet detected. The research suggested it originated from a star nearly double the age of our Sun.</p>

<p>In September 2023, BBC News and Sky at Night Magazine furthered this discussion, referencing Matthew Hopkins, the lead researcher on the project aimed at defining the comet’s lifespan. Hopkins expressed excitement over the discovery, indicating it was an unexpected highlight in his research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s a fantastic opportunity to test our model on something brand new and possibly ancient,” said Matthew Hopkins, main author of the research.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is an object from a part of the galaxy we've never seen up close before. We think there's a two-thirds chance this comet is older than the solar system, and that it's been drifting through interstellar space ever since,” stated Prof Chris Lintott, a co-author of the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS has gained momentum in recent years, with astronomers increasingly focused on understanding their origins and characteristics. The development of models to predict interstellar object behaviour has been crucial in identifying and studying these ancient visitors.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS represents not only a scientific curiosity but also a potential link to the early formation of the Milky Way galaxy, highlighting the connection between ancient stars and the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun in 2025, allowing for further observations of its behaviour and composition. This will provide additional data to enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their role in cosmic history.</p>
