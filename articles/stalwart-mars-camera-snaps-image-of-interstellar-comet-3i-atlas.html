      <h2>Stalwart Mars camera snaps image of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>NASA’s HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has captured an image of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas as it passed approximately 19 million miles from Mars on October 2, 2023. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/Atlas is only the third known interstellar object to travel through the solar system. Scientists are eager to analyze the images captured by HiRISE, which were delayed in release due to the federal government shutdown. The images became accessible to the public and scientific community on November 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of imaging: October 2, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: Approximately 19 million miles</li>
    <li>Speed of comet: About 130,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Resolution of images: Approximately 19 miles per pixel</li>
    <li>HiRISE has been operational for nearly 20 years</li>
    <li>Images released on: November 19, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA’s HiRISE camera, designed primarily for imaging Mars, successfully captured images of the comet 3I/Atlas on October 2, 2023. The imaging occurred while the comet traveled at high speed through the solar system. Due to a federal government shutdown, the release of these images was postponed until November 19, 2023.</p>

<p>Following the release, scientists began analyzing the data, which could provide insights into the comet’s composition and behavior as it approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“HiRISE’s main job for the past 19 years has been to image the surface of Mars,” said Ingrid Daubar, an associate research professor at Brown University and deputy principal investigator on HiRISE. “But it’s a great camera, and we’ve got great engineers, so we’re also able to point it away from Mars and get images of other bodies with really accurate targeting.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sam Birch, an assistant professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Brown, noted, “The images might be able to resolve some features in and around its coma, the mass of ice and dust that surrounds a comet’s nucleus.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar object ever found, which highlights its importance to scientific research. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is set to launch the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, a 10-year project that aims to scan the southern sky, potentially leading to more discoveries of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>The HiRISE camera has provided significant scientific insights over its nearly two-decade mission, which originally aimed to last only two years. Its ability to adapt to new scientific challenges has been instrumental in expanding our understanding of both Mars and other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the images of 3I/Atlas to gather data regarding its motion and features. This investigation will serve as a foundation for future studies of interstellar objects as they become more frequently observed.</p>
