      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS To Brush Past Earth Today</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, is set to make its closest approach to Earth today, October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units, or approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometres). NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to the planet.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar visitor after ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, has attracted significant scientific interest due to its hyperbolic trajectory and unusual composition. While the comet is currently unobservable because of its position near the Sun, scientists are preparing to study its characteristics further after its perihelion, which occurs on October 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 1.8 AU (≈167 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest to the Sun (Perihelion):</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Threat Level:</strong> None — safe distance</li>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Interstellar comet</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Distant star system</li>
    <li><strong>Path:</strong> Hyperbolic (one-time pass)</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus Size:</strong> Up to 5.6 km</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 137,000 mph (221,000 km/h)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, when it was approximately 410 million miles (670 million km) from the Sun. Its interstellar origin was confirmed through archived data from three ATLAS observatories and Caltech’s Zwicky Transient Facility in California.</p>

<p>The comet is currently travelling from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, nearing the Milky Way's centre. It will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, travelling just inside Mars’ orbit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA confirms that 3I/ATLAS poses zero collision risk,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “Its trajectory indicates it will pass through the solar system only once.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, commented, “The unusual chemical emissions of 3I/ATLAS raise questions about its origins. We must consider all possibilities, including artificial origins.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows two previous interstellar comets, ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. While 3I/ATLAS displays some unusual characteristics, including emissions of nickel tetracarbonyl, scientists from the University of A Coruña in Spain have modelled its motion and found no signs of artificial interference, suggesting it likely originated from the galaxy's thin disk.</p>

<p>Debate continues within the scientific community regarding the implications of its composition and behaviour. Some researchers believe that its chemical emissions could provide insights into the building blocks present in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach to the Sun, astronomers are expected to conduct follow-up observations of 3I/ATLAS, particularly around December 2025, when it may become visible again. NASA and other observatories will continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and composition.</p>
