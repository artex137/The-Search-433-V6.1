      <h2>3I/Atlas could be 'Trojan Horse' - 40% chance it's alien tech masquerading as a comet, scientist says</h2>

<p>3I/Atlas, the third interstellar visitor, may not be a natural object, according to Harvard scientist Avi Loeb. He has stated there is a 40 per cent chance that it could be an alien technological probe, as he shared in a recent blog post. Loeb's claims follow observations made during the object's flyby of Mars on October 3, 2023.</p>

<p>This matter is significant because it raises questions about the nature of interstellar objects and the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. Authorities, including the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, are currently monitoring 3I/Atlas and await further data from various space missions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas has a diameter likely larger than 5 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Its mass is estimated at least 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>The object is traveling at a speed of 60,000 km/sec (200,000 km/minute).</li>
    <li>It has exhibited seven anomalies, according to Loeb.</li>
    <li>The object is aligned with the ecliptic plane of planets within 5 degrees, which Loeb claims has a 0.2% chance of occurring.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will come close to Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, with a 0.005% likelihood for this trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, 3I/Atlas flew by Mars, prompting observations from Mars orbiters. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) released images of the object, while data from Mars Express is pending. The ESA's JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to gather more information in November 2023.</p>

<p>Loeb has identified several anomalies in 3I/Atlas's characteristics, including its size, speed, and trajectory. He has noted that the light from the object showed extreme negative polarization, suggesting it might be generating its own light.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "There is a 30–40% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS does not have a fully natural origin," attributing this to the seven anomalies he has observed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb added, "We should be prepared to battle an enemy that could be just like the Trojan Horse from Greek mythology."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas follows previous interstellar objects, including ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have sparked debate about their origins. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretation of such anomalies, with ongoing discussions regarding the implications of potential extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into 3I/Atlas will continue as more data is released from Mars orbiters and upcoming missions. Loeb remains optimistic about uncovering the true nature of the interstellar visitor in the coming months.</p>
