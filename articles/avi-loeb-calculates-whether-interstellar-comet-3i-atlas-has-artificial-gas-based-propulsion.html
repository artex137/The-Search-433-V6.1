      <h2>Avi Loeb calculates whether interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has artificial gas-based propulsion</h2>

<p>Astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University has presented calculations regarding the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which was discovered in July 2025. His analysis, revealed on January 6, 2026, focuses on the comet's trajectory and composition, particularly examining the behavior of gas and dust in its anti-tail. The comet passed perihelion in October 2025 and is currently on a confirmed escape trajectory through the solar system.</p>

<p>The significance of Loeb's work lies in the potential implications for understanding the nature of 3I/Atlas. Observations have shown an unusual anti-tail extending hundreds of thousands of kilometers towards Sol, leading to discussions on whether this behavior indicates artificial propulsion. Ongoing observations from various telescopes aim to clarify the composition of the comet's anti-tail and its implications for interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Passed perihelion in October 2025, approximately 1.4 astronomical units from Sol.</li>
    <li>Approached Earth on December 19, 2025, at about 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Travels at a speed of 57 km/s through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted using telescopes including Hubble and Telescópio Green Bank.</li>
    <li>Next close approach to Jupiter is scheduled for March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: Comet 3I/Atlas is discovered.</p>
<p>October 2025: The comet passes perihelion at a distance of about 1.4 astronomical units from Sol.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: 3I/Atlas approaches Earth at approximately 269 million kilometers.</p>
<p>December 18, 2025: Observations conducted under the Breakthrough Listen program do not detect artificial radio signals from the comet.</p>
<p>March 2026: The comet is expected to approach Jupiter before leaving the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/Atlas is a natural comet, the gas flow in the anti-tail should not exceed 5,000 kilometers from the nucleus,” said Loeb. “Detection of molecules like CO2 along the anti-tail could indicate something different.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The characteristics of 3I/Atlas challenge existing knowledge about comet behavior and composition. Previous interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, have shown typical gaseous comas and dust tails, but 3I/Atlas exhibits a unique structure with larger dust particles. This suggests that the comet's dust may better resist solar deceleration, prompting further studies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/Atlas will continue with ground- and space-based telescopes until mid-2026, when the object will become indistinguishable. Future analyses may clarify the distribution of gas and dust in the anti-tail, contributing to the understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
