      <h2>Colombian pilot captures 'best UFO footage ever' at 12,500ft</h2>

<p>A Colombian pilot has recorded what many are calling the “best UFO footage ever” while flying at approximately 12,000 feet in Antioquia, Colombia, in 2022. The video, which has gained significant attention since it went viral in 2023, shows an unidentified object traveling at high speeds without visible wings, engines, or propulsion systems. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the sighting.</p>

<p>This footage is significant as it has sparked renewed interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), a term preferred by authorities such as the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The clarity of the video sets it apart from typical grainy footage seen in viral clips, prompting discussions about its authenticity and what it may reveal about aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video recorded in 2022 by a Colombian pilot.</li>
    <li>Altitude of approximately 12,000 feet.</li>
    <li>Object traveling at speeds around 160 km/h (100 mph).</li>
    <li>Confirmed as authentic by ufologist Jaime Maussan.</li>
    <li>Video went viral in 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2022, a Colombian pilot captured a video of an unidentified object while flying at 12,000 feet in Antioquia. The footage remained largely unnoticed until it went viral in 2023 due to its clarity and unique characteristics. In early 2026, the video was confirmed as authentic by ufologist Jaime Maussan, further fueling interest in the sighting.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This UFO/UAP looks exactly like the UFOs we’ve seen in a million movies,” said an unidentified source commenting on the video.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The term “UFO” has become less common in official discussions, with the Pentagon and DHS adopting "UAP" to describe unidentified aerial phenomena. This shift reflects a growing interest in the study of aerial phenomena and the importance of clarity in reporting such sightings. The clarity of the footage captured by the Colombian pilot is notable compared to other viral videos, which often lack detail.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for further investigations related to the sighting. The ongoing interest in UAPs may prompt future studies or discussions among aviation and aerospace agencies.</p>
