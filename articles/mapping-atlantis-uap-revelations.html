      <h2>Mapping Atlantis and UAP Revelations: Insights from Experts</h2>

<p>On August 28, 2025, author and researcher David Edward presented findings on the lost continent of Atlantis during a segment on Coast to Coast AM. He claims to have identified a location that aligns with Plato’s geographical markers, suggesting it could be the key to mapping the ten provinces of the Atlantean empire. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this discussion.</p>

<p>This exploration matters as it connects ancient history with modern inquiries into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Authorities and researchers are increasingly focused on transparency regarding UAPs, with ongoing investigations into their implications for understanding both historical and contemporary events.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: August 28, 2025</li>
    <li>Presenter: David Edward, former U.S. Army counterintelligence agent</li>
    <li>Focus: Atlantis and its geographical significance</li>
    <li>Second segment featured: Dr. Gregory Rogers, former Air Force Major and NASA flight surgeon</li>
    <li>Discussion on: UFO reverse-engineering and transparency</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>David Edward has presented his theories about Atlantis based on Plato's writings, asserting that a specific location matches the criteria described in historical texts. He believes this discovery is significant for understanding biblical chronology and the broader implications of ancient civilizations.</p>

<p>In the second half of the program, investigative reporter Cheryll Jones interviewed Dr. Gregory Rogers. He discussed over 30 years of secrecy regarding UAPs and the necessity for full transparency in understanding non-human technologies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Only one location meets [Plato’s] geographical markers,” said David Edward, emphasizing the importance of his findings in understanding the ancient world.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There has been a push for full transparency on UFOs and the technologies associated with them,” stated Dr. Gregory Rogers during his interview.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discussion on Atlantis and UAPs reflects a growing trend in both academic and public interest in historical mysteries and their connections to modern phenomena. Previous incidents of UAP sightings have prompted governmental and scientific inquiries into their origins and implications.</p>

<p>Research into ancient civilizations continues to evolve as new technologies and methodologies provide fresh insights into historical narratives.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future investigations are expected to delve deeper into the implications of Edward’s findings on Atlantis and the ongoing discussions surrounding UAP transparency. Further studies and reports may emerge as researchers seek to connect these themes more explicitly.</p>
