      <h2>Astronomer captures first images of comet 3I/ATLAS passing behind the sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS has reappeared from behind the sun, providing astronomers a new opportunity to study the rare celestial object as it travels through the inner solar system. The comet, first detected in July, is only the third known interstellar comet ever observed. Its reemergence follows a close pass to the sun in late October, during which it became obscured by solar glare.</p>

<p>The reappearance of 3I/ATLAS has sparked considerable interest among scientists and amateur astronomers. Researchers believe that its unusual behavior and trajectory may yield insights into the composition and evolution of comets originating beyond our solar system. Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, successfully captured what is believed to be the first post-perihelion optical image of 3I/ATLAS on October 31.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion on October 29, coming within 210 million kilometers of the sun.</li>
    <li>Qicheng Zhang captured the first optical image on October 31, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at over 210,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>It is currently detectable with standard amateur telescopes across much of the Northern Hemisphere.</li>
    <li>Zhang reported that the comet appears as a faint, gradually brightening smudge.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS. The comet reached its closest approach to the sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2023. During this time, it became obscured by solar glare, limiting observations from Earth. On October 31, Qicheng Zhang captured the first optical images of the comet as it emerged from behind the sun.</p>
<p>Since then, Zhang has recorded additional images using a small telescope and shared them on his Cometary blog on November 2, 2023. Observers have been advised that clear skies and a low eastern horizon are necessary to see the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is rapidly rising from the sun,” Zhang said. “In one week it will be about 25 or 30 degrees away from the sun, allowing larger telescopes around the world to begin tracking it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever observed, following the discovery of 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These celestial objects offer valuable data about the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>
<p>Comets typically heat up and release gas as they approach stars, revealing clues about their chemical composition and origins. Early research suggests that 3I/ATLAS may be billions of years older than our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers expect to gather more observations of 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the sun and becomes easier to observe. Further studies will help determine whether the comet's brightness continues to increase and what materials it may contain from its original star system.</p>
