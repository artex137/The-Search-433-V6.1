      <h2>Congress Releases Military Surveillance Video of UFO</h2>

<p>On September 10, 2025, Congress released a military surveillance video showing a UFO splitting a Hellfire missile in half upon direct strike. The incident occurred off the coast of Yemen and was captured by a U.S. Reaper drone. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities resulting from this event.</p>

<p>This video has raised significant concerns regarding military encounters with unidentified flying objects (UFOs). During a Congressional hearing, Representative Eric Burlison, R-Mo., presented the footage, which was provided by a whistleblower to the House Oversight subcommittee on UFO transparency. Authorities are now calling for increased scrutiny and transparency regarding military encounters with UFOs.</p>
