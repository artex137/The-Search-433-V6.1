      <h2>3I/ATLAS boosts international simulations of orbital tracking and defense against cosmic threats</h2>

<p>The Agência Espacial Europeia has activated its full planetary defense triad in November 2025, following the detection of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS by the ATLAS telescope in Chile in July. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory, traveling at speeds of up to 250,000 km/h, has prompted coordinated international exercises to enhance tracking and response capabilities.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it underscores the need for precise tracking of cosmic objects to mitigate potential risks. Authorities from multiple nations, including Japan and the United States, have engaged in extensive training and simulations to improve their preparedness against asteroid impacts and other cosmic threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Activation of planetary defense triad: November 2025</li>
    <li>Detection of 3I/ATLAS: July 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025, at 11:43 UTC</li>
    <li>Initial speed of 3I/ATLAS: 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Duration of ESA simulation: November 10-12, 2025</li>
    <li>Global observation exercise start date: November 27, 2025</li>
    <li>End date of exercise: January 27, 2026</li>
    <li>Number of participating countries: 12</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2025, pre-discovery observations of 3I/ATLAS began. The comet was officially detected by the ATLAS telescope in July, and it reached perihelion on October 29, 2025. The European Space Agency conducted a simulation from November 10 to 12 to test rapid response modeling. Japan's training took place from November 15 to 17, integrating commercial satellites in impact simulations. The global observation exercise commenced on November 27, 2025, and will continue until January 27, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The simulations have revealed significant improvements in object location accuracy, refined by a factor of ten,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, stated, “The solar anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS may consist of a swarm of compact objects, not evaporating gas.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its detection has highlighted the growing importance of international collaboration in planetary defense. Past incidents with asteroids have prompted authorities to enhance their preparedness and response strategies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Agencies will continue their coordinated efforts until the conclusion of the global observation exercise on January 27, 2026. A closing conference call is scheduled for February 3, 2026, to discuss outcomes and future protocols for civilian responses to cosmic threats.</p>
