      <h2>Director of New UFO Film Featuring Secretary Rubio Says Trump Is Considering Announcing "We Are Not Alone"</h2>

<p>Dan Farah, director and producer of a new UFO documentary, has claimed that former President Donald Trump is considering an announcement regarding extraterrestrial life. The film features interviews with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and several senators and congressmen. It posits that the U.S. government has been reverse-engineering extraterrestrial spacecraft since the 1940s.</p>

<p>This film has gained attention due to its high-profile interviews and its implications for national security and public awareness of UFOs. Farah emphasized the need for transparency and whistleblower protections to encourage individuals with knowledge of the subject to come forward. He suggested that a presidential announcement could significantly change the public discourse surrounding UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Film features 34 credible individuals, including government officials.</li>
    <li>Farah argues for stronger whistleblower protections.</li>
    <li>Marco Rubio states the need for disclosure on camera.</li>
    <li>Farah mentions a potential internal discussion within Trump's administration regarding the film.</li>
    <li>Farah claims Trump contemplated a similar announcement during his last presidency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the documentary, Dan Farah discusses the ongoing secrecy surrounding UFO information and the implications for national security. He highlights that many individuals have kept information hidden due to fear of repercussions. Rubio's comments in the film suggest that information has been withheld from sitting presidents, which raises concerns about governmental transparency.</p>

<p>Farah notes that Trump was aware of the basic facts regarding UFOs during his presidency and considered making an announcement. He believes the release of the film, alongside Rubio's involvement, could encourage Trump to address the issue publicly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This film features 34 credible people putting their reputations and names on the line, which I think is stronger evidence than any video or photo,” said Farah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I need to know what they learned, because taxpayers paid for this and it’s in our interest to know what’s going on,” Rubio stated on camera.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’ve come to understand that Trump is borderline enraged about how much has been hidden from the White House,” Farah added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around UFOs has intensified in recent years, with various government reports and testimonies from officials suggesting a need for greater transparency. The notion of a secretive government program has raised questions about accountability and public trust.</p>

<p>Prior incidents of unexplained aerial phenomena have fueled speculation about the existence of extraterrestrial life and the government's role in concealing information. The film aims to shed light on these issues and advocate for a more open dialogue.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the release of the documentary, discussions within the Trump administration about how to respond publicly are expected. Farah believes that an official announcement from the president could be imminent, depending on the administration's strategy for addressing the film's content.</p>
