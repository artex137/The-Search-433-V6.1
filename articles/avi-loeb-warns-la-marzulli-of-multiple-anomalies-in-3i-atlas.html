      <h2>Avi Loeb Warns L.A. Marzulli of ‘Multiple Anomalies’ in 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Renowned Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS during an interview with filmmaker L.A. Marzulli. Loeb, speaking recently, emphasized the need for greater humility and curiosity in the scientific community regarding this mysterious object, which has drawn attention since it entered the solar system.</p>

<p>Loeb's remarks highlight significant anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, which he argues should not be dismissed as merely another comet. He stated that there are unique characteristics of this object that warrant further investigation. The astrophysicist pointed out that 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever observed, indicating a lack of comparative data in the field.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed.</li>
    <li>Loeb noted a one-in-500 chance of the object's orbital alignment occurring randomly.</li>
    <li>The object's composition features large amounts of nickel and very little iron.</li>
    <li>Loeb's key moment to watch is on Mar. 16, 2026, when 3I/ATLAS enters Jupiter’s gravitational domain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Professor Avi Loeb has openly discussed the anomalies of 3I/ATLAS, emphasizing the unusual features of the object since its discovery. In his interview with Marzulli, Loeb noted the persistent jet pointing toward the sun, contrary to the behavior of typical comets. This was observed alongside the identification of four distinct jets in Hubble Space Telescope images.</p>
<p>Loeb also highlighted the peculiar orbital characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, raising questions about its rotation axis and alignment with the planets. His concerns about the object's unusual composition have further fueled the debate on its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There are a large number of anomalies about this object,” Loeb said. “And in my view, irrespective of what your opinion is—even if you think it’s just a comet—you have to be curious about what is the origin of those anomalies and why do they exist, because that’s an opportunity to learn.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The only place we find that is in industrial production of nickel alloys that we produce technologically,” Loeb noted about the composition of the object.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“You multiply small probability by big impact, and you end up with something that must be taken seriously,” he said, referring to the potential consequences of dismissing unlikely scenarios.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's comments reflect a broader trend in science where unconventional ideas face skepticism from mainstream academia. He cited an instance where a scientific paper he authored was rejected without review, which he believes illustrates the resistance faced by those who challenge prevailing narratives.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, Loeb has indicated that the entry of 3I/ATLAS into Jupiter’s gravitational domain on Mar. 16, 2026, will be a significant event for further observation and analysis. Scientists and researchers may prepare to study the object more closely during this period.</p>
