      <h2>Senator Marco Rubio Alleges Government Cover-Up of Alien Technology</h2>

<p>Senator Marco Rubio has claimed that rogue government elements have concealed information about contact with aliens for decades, even keeping U.S. presidents uninformed about the potential threat. Rubio made these statements in a new documentary, <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, which will begin streaming on Prime Video on November 21.</p>

<p>This revelation raises significant concerns about national security and the transparency of government operations. Authorities have begun to acknowledge the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), previously known as UFOs, with the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office documenting over 1,600 sightings in the last four years.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: <em>The Age of Disclosure</em></li>
    <li>Streaming release date: November 21</li>
    <li>Over 1,600 UAP sightings logged by the Pentagon in the last four years</li>
    <li>Three public congressional hearings held since 2022</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, the U.S. government has begun to shift its stance on UFOs. The Pentagon established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office to investigate UAP sightings.</p>
<p>Since 2022, Congress has held multiple public hearings featuring testimony from military personnel regarding their experiences with UAPs. These hearings have highlighted the unusual characteristics of many sightings, including their ability to defy the laws of physics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities – and it's not ours," said Rubio in the documentary.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "This was pretty shocking to hear someone of Rubio's level making that allegation," said Dan Farah, producer and director of <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "I have seen, with my own eyes, non-human craft and non-human beings," stated Jay Stratton, former director of the government's UAP Task Force.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, the U.S. government has maintained a high level of secrecy regarding UFOs and related phenomena. However, recent years have seen a shift towards transparency, with the public increasingly exposed to discussions about UAPs. This change has sparked widespread interest and debate regarding the implications of such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP sightings are ongoing, with additional congressional hearings expected as authorities continue to assess the implications of Rubio's claims and the broader issue of national security.</p>
