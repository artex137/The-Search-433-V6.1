      <h2>Avi Loeb highlights tightly collimated anti-tail jet of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard physicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has published a new essay on Medium on December 17, 2025, discussing the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> and its unusual features as observed in images taken on December 15. Loeb notes that the object exhibits a “tightly collimated” jet as its sun-facing anti-tail, which appears as a thin, straight stream rather than a dispersed tail.</p>

<p>This observation raises significant questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb argues that it is rare for a natural comet to display such a tightly collimated jet both before and after perihelion, with odds estimated at 0.000025. He has called for more attention from experts regarding the unusual properties of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to the sun on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb published his essay on December 17, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images of 3I/ATLAS were taken on December 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the sun is set for December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb estimates the odds of such a tightly collimated anti-tail occurring randomly at 0.000025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 15, 2025, new images of 3I/ATLAS were captured, revealing an unusual sun-facing anti-tail jet. Two days later, on December 17, Loeb published his essay discussing these findings and the implications for understanding the object.</p>

<p>Loeb and his colleagues, Dr. Eric Keto and Dr. Frank Laukien, have examined the characteristics of the anti-tail, suggesting that it may originate from different sources before and after perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What natural mechanism could explain a tightly-collimated anti-tail jet both before and after perihelion in the direction of the sun?” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The pre-perihelion anti-tail is a sunward jet located near the rotation axis that happens to align with the sunward vector.” - Dr. Eric Keto</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Only a typical natural cometary tail can show such a well-focused jet by sunlight. Such behavior was rare in anti-tails.” - Dr. Frank Laukien</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb’s observations come as part of an ongoing effort to better understand interstellar objects. The scientific community has expressed interest in the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS since its discovery, with varying opinions on its classification and origin.</p>

<p>Loeb has previously raised questions about the technological origins of other interstellar objects, contributing to a broader discussion about the nature of these celestial visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the sun, scientists will continue to analyze its behavior and characteristics. The upcoming closest approach on December 19, 2025, may provide further insights into the object’s nature and the anomalies associated with it.</p>
