      <h2>I'm A Celebrity castle near Abergele seeking new homes for TWO unique items</h2>

<p>Gwrych Castle, near Abergele, is looking for new homes for a red telephone box and a UFO as part of its restoration efforts. The Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust announced this initiative to prepare for the next stage of restoration on Monday, October 23, 2023.</p>

<p>This move is significant as it reflects the castle's ongoing restoration and the need to create space for visitor amenities. The trust stated that the items are being offered due to limited interior space as they begin work on the main building.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Gwrych Castle, Abergele, Wales</li>
    <li>Items for relocation: Red telephone box and UFO</li>
    <li>Previous use: Telephone box used in I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2020 and 2021</li>
    <li>Planning permission granted for 'Castle Core Project' in March 2023</li>
    <li>Contact for inquiries: info@gwrychcastle.co.uk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2023, Gwrych Castle received planning permission for the 'Castle Core Project,' aimed at making the main building water-tight for the first time in over 30 years. On October 23, 2023, the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust announced the search for new homes for the red telephone box and UFO as part of its restoration preparations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It’s not every day that you find a UFO and a red telephone box looking for a new home but today is that day. As we prepare for the next exciting stage of the castle’s restoration, we are making space along our visitor route and parting with two unique items.”

<blockquote>
    “Once the work on the main building begins, we will need space for a shop and event space. The phone box is very heavy so it is tricky for us to work around unfortunately.”

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The red telephone box was used during the filming of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! when the show was held in the UK due to the pandemic. The UFO was part of a cross-marketing Christmas campaign with a major retailer. The castle has been undergoing restoration to enhance its visitor experience and preserve its historical significance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust will continue its restoration efforts while seeking new homes for the telephone box and UFO. Interested parties can contact the trust via email for more information on the items.</p>
