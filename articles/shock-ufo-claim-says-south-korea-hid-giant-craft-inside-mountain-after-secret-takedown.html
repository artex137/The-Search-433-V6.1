      <h2>Shock UFO Claim Says South Korea Hid Giant Craft Inside Mountain After Secret Takedown</h2>

<p>A new UFO controversy has emerged following claims by whistleblower Dr. Steven Greer that South Korea secretly downed a massive alien craft using an advanced energy weapon and concealed it within a mountain near Seoul. The alleged takedown and subsequent hiding of the craft have not resulted in any reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked significant public interest and debate, prompting scrutiny of South Korea's military and its operations. Authorities have not officially commented on the allegations, and the lack of substantiating evidence has led to mixed reactions among experts and enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Claim made by Dr. Steven Greer, a whistleblower.</li>
    <li>Allegation involves an advanced energy weapon used to down an alien craft.</li>
    <li>Location: carved mountain outside Seoul, South Korea.</li>
    <li>No confirmed evidence has been presented to support the claim.</li>
    <li>Critics highlight Greer's history of unverified UFO disclosures.</li>
    <li>Some satellite images are being analyzed for potential verification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Dr. Steven Greer has made claims of UFO sightings and government cover-ups for decades. Recently, he has alleged that South Korean forces utilized electronic warfare to bring down a large extraterrestrial vehicle. According to Greer, the immense size of the craft necessitated the excavation of a mountain to conceal it, which he claims remains hidden today.</p>

<p>Supporters of Greer argue that the specificity of the claim allows for potential verification, especially given South Korea's geographical constraints. However, critics have pointed out that such extraordinary claims require substantial evidence, which has yet to be provided.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” said a spokesperson for a prominent UFO research organization, highlighting the need for corroborating data to substantiate Greer's allegations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This claim is not the first of its kind. Similar allegations have surfaced over the years, often lacking concrete evidence. Notable figures in the UFO community, such as Ross Coulthart and the late John Lear, have previously mentioned large alien vehicles that were purportedly hidden from the public. The ongoing debate reflects a longstanding fascination with UFOs and government secrecy.</p>

<p>The geography of South Korea, with its mountainous regions and military zones, has been cited by supporters as a plausible area for such an operation to remain concealed, despite the country's technological advancements and dense population.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, no official investigations have been announced regarding the allegations. The debate surrounding the claim continues, with both supporters and skeptics analyzing available data and satellite imagery for verification. The situation remains fluid, with the possibility of further developments in the future.</p>
