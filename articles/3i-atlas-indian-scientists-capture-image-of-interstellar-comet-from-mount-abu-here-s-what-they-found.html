      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Indian Scientists Capture Image Of Interstellar Comet From Mount Abu; Here’s What They Found</h2>

<p>Indian scientists at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Mount Abu have captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS). The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, and passed closest to the Sun on October 29, 2025. It is expected to come closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 170 million miles.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks one of the few instances where scientists have tracked an interstellar object as it travels through the solar system. The findings from PRL may contribute to the understanding of such comets and their characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (170 million miles).</li>
    <li>Observations conducted using a 1.2 m telescope at PRL, Mount Abu.</li>
    <li>PRL reported findings through its LISA spectrograph.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, scientists discovered the comet 3I/ATLAS. It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025. Following this perihelion event, the PRL team utilized their 1.2 m telescope to observe the comet. The closest approach to Earth is anticipated on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“PRL’s findings certainly say so,” said a spokesperson from the Physical Research Laboratory, referring to the comet's typical characteristics as observed through their equipment.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare and provide unique insights into the formation of our solar system. The scientific community closely monitors such objects to learn more about their origins and composition. Previous observations of interstellar objects have sparked interest and speculation about their nature and potential significance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and analyze further data from their observations. Additional findings may be shared with the public as the comet nears its closest approach.</p>
