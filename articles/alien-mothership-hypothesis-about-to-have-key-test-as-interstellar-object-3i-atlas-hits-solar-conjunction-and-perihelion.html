      <h2>Alien Mothership Hypothesis About To Have Key Test As Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Hits Solar Conjunction And Perihelion</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to undergo a key test of the "alien mothership" hypothesis as it reaches solar conjunction and perihelion on October 29. The object, first observed by astronomers on July 1, has unusual properties that have sparked speculation about its origin, though no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant for scientists as they seek to understand the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory. The object is currently positioned behind the Sun, making direct observations from Earth impossible. Experts from institutions including NASA and Harvard University have weighed in on the comet's characteristics and potential implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>The comet reaches solar conjunction on October 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurs on October 29, 2023, when it is closest to the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently approximately 6.4 AU from the Sun (1 AU = distance from Earth to Sun).</li>
    <li>The object exhibits unusual chemistry and a rare anti-tail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, astronomers from ATLAS identified 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar comet. Following its discovery, the object exhibited unique features that prompted further study. As it moves closer to the Sun, it is expected to outgas and release volatile materials. On October 21, the object will be in solar conjunction, and on October 29, it will reach perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for Solar System small bodies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If you want to take a vacation, take it before [October 29], because who knows what will happen?” stated Harvard professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the list of confirmed interstellar visitors, joining 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The object has spurred discussions among astronomers regarding its origins and the implications of potential alien technology. While some have raised the "alien mothership" hypothesis, many in the scientific community advocate for a natural explanation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, scientists will monitor the object for any changes in its trajectory that could indicate unusual behavior. Observations from Mars orbiters and potentially from Jupiter's orbit may provide further insights into the comet's characteristics.</p>
