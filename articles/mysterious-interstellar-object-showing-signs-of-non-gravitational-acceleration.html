      <h2>Mysterious Interstellar Object Showing Signs of "Non-Gravitational Acceleration"</h2>

<p>In early July, astronomers discovered a mysterious object named 3I/ATLAS, believed to be the third interstellar visitor in our solar system, as it reached its closest point to the Sun last week. The object has displayed unexpected brightening and a change in color, raising questions about its nature and behavior.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may indicate unusual physical processes affecting 3I/ATLAS. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory navigation engineer Davide Farnocchia reported that the object is showing signs of "non-gravitational acceleration," suggesting it is losing mass. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has indicated that this could lead to observable changes in the object over the coming months.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery Date: Early July 2023</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Sun: Last week</li>
    <li>Reported Mass Loss: Up to one-tenth in a month</li>
    <li>Expected Observable Changes: Large plume of gas in November and December 2025</li>
    <li>Significant Brightening: Observed during perihelion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July, astronomers first spotted 3I/ATLAS. Last week, the object reached its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, and exhibited unexpected brightening alongside a color shift to a distinctly bluer hue. Recent reports from NASA and Harvard have indicated that the object is showing signs of non-gravitational acceleration, likely due to mass loss.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS could lose about a sixth of its mass, which may explain its unusual brightening. He also noted that observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have detected deviations in the object's expected path.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Such a massive mass loss should be detectable in the form of a large plume of gas surrounding 3I/ATLAS during the upcoming months of November and December 2025,” said Avi Loeb in his blog.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I think it’s inappropriate to withhold the scientific information from the community because we are planning future observations based on what we know about 3I/ATLAS,” Loeb told NBC.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident marks the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system, following previous discoveries. The ongoing investigation into 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the characteristics and behaviors of such objects, as well as their potential implications for our understanding of space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and push for further observations, particularly from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The potential mass loss and resulting plume will be closely observed in late 2025.</p>
