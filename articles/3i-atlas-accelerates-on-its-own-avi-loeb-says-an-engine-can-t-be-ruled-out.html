      <h2>3I/ATLAS Accelerates on Its Own — Avi Loeb Says an 'Engine' Can't Be Ruled Out</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed unexpected movement from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System. The comet has shown slight but measurable acceleration that does not align with standard models of comet behaviour, according to NASA engineers and international research teams.</p>

<p>This finding has sparked interest and caution within the astronomy community. Some researchers suggest the acceleration could be due to natural outgassing, while others, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, argue that the data does not entirely rule out a technological explanation, such as internal propulsion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is exhibiting unexpected acceleration as it travels through the Solar System.</li>
    <li>Recent measurements indicate a non-gravitational acceleration of roughly 3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> astronomical units per day squared.</li>
    <li>The object has a minimum mass of about 3.3 × 10<sup>10</sup> grams and a diameter of at least five kilometres.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted between May and September 2025, involving over 4,000 ground-based measurements.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth in December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between May and September 2025, astronomers collected over 4,000 observations of 3I/ATLAS. These measurements revealed an unexpected acceleration that prompted further analysis. Loeb and his colleagues published their findings, which suggested that the object's mass and size could influence its movement.</p>

<p>As scientists continue to study 3I/ATLAS, they have noted its typical cometary features, including a dust coma and volatile gases. The upcoming closest approach to Earth in December 2025 will provide additional opportunities for observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The small residual acceleration does not eliminate the idea of propulsion.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also commented that “science should remain open to possibilities until firm evidence emerges.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Many scientists advocate for a conservative interpretation of the data, emphasising that 3I/ATLAS displays the typical characteristics of a comet. Observations show changes in its tail and the presence of volatile gases, suggesting a natural origin rather than artificial propulsion.</p>

<p>Despite the intriguing findings, sceptics highlight that the detected acceleration is only an upper bound and that the object's large mass could obscure any minor propulsive effect.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Upcoming observations during 3I/ATLAS's closest approach to Earth in December 2025 may provide clarity on whether its motion deviates from standard predictions. Researchers aim to determine if the anomaly is a result of natural physics or something more unusual.</p>
