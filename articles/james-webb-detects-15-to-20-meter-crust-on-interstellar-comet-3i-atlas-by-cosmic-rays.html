      <h2>James Webb detects 15 to 20 meter crust on interstellar comet 3I/Atlas by cosmic rays</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has identified a crust measuring 15 to 20 meters deep on the surface of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, according to researchers from the Royal Belgian Institute of Space Aeronomy. This discovery occurred when the comet was observed in August 2025, at a distance of 445 million kilometers from Earth. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it highlights the effects of billions of years of exposure to galactic cosmic rays, which have altered the comet's surface composition. Researchers are now studying the implications of this crust formation and the sublimation process that began after the comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed exceeding 210,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The estimated age of the comet is up to 7 billion years.</li>
    <li>Its coma is dominated by carbon dioxide, with a CO2/H2O ratio of 7.6 ± 0.3.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas has been observed to emit 129 kilograms of CO2 per second from its core.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, while it was traveling through the constellation Sagittarius. Initial activity of the comet was recorded in May 2025, at a distance of 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun. The comet was observed in August 2025, when it was 445 million kilometers from Earth. After reaching perihelion on October 29, 2025, the comet began to sublimate, releasing gas and dust from its outer layer.</p>

<p>Following perihelion, scientists observed changes in the comet’s brightness and composition, noting an increase in its blue hue, which signaled the release of volatile gases. The James Webb Space Telescope's NIRSpec instrument detected elevated concentrations of CO2 in the coma, suggesting a formation in icy regions rich in carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The crust formation on 3I/Atlas demonstrates how prolonged exposure to cosmic rays can chemically reshape celestial bodies,” said a spokesperson from the Royal Belgian Institute of Space Aeronomy.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, following the discovery of 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike solar comets, which are protected by the heliosphere, 3I/Atlas has traveled through the galaxy exposed to intense radiation, leading to significant alterations in its surface chemistry.</p>

<p>The study of interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas provides insights into the primordial materials that predate the Solar System, highlighting the differences in composition between solar and interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it moves away from the Sun, comparing pre- and post-perihelion spectra to map its original composition. Further observations will help refine models of cometary evolution and the effects of cosmic radiation on interstellar objects.</p>
