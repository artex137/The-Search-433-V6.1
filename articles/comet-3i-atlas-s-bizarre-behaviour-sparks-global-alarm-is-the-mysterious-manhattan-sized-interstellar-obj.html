      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS's bizarre behaviour sparks global alarm</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has become a focal point for astronomers worldwide as it displays unusual behaviour, prompting an emergency probe from the NASA-backed International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) earlier this week. The comet, believed to be the size of Manhattan, has raised concerns about its implications for humanity, according to Harvard scientist Avi Loeb.</p>

<p>This situation is significant as it marks the first organized international effort to study an interstellar object. The Minor Planet Centre has announced a global campaign to observe 3I/ATLAS from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026. Scientists are particularly intrigued by the comet's anomalous anti-solar tail, which has changed direction, facing away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Estimated to weigh 33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>Detection:</strong> First spotted in July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign Dates:</strong> November 27, 2025 – January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Key Scientist:</strong> Avi Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Agency:</strong> International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was initially detected by the ATLAS survey telescope in July 2025. In September, new images were captured by the Nordic Optical Telescope in Spain's Canary Islands. Following its unusual behaviour, the IAWN launched an emergency probe earlier this week.</p>

<p>The global observation campaign is set to begin on November 27, 2025, and will run for two months, aiming to refine methods for tracking the comet's exact location.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “It’s at least a thousand times more massive than the previous interstellar objects we’ve seen. And the question is, why is such a giant object delivered to our inner solar system, when we saw only small ones before?”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also emphasized the need for vigilance, urging that “the international community must stay alert and develop a defense strategy in case 3I/ATLAS turns out to be a black swan event.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The term “Black Swan” describes rare, high-impact events that are nearly impossible to predict but appear inevitable in hindsight. Loeb has raised concerns that 3I/ATLAS could be a technological artifact with active intelligence, which could have either benign or malign intentions.</p>

<p>The unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS, including its non-gravitational acceleration and trajectory, has prompted scientists to consider the possibility that it may not be a natural object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will conduct a campaign to monitor 3I/ATLAS, assessing its trajectory and behaviour. The closest approach to the Sun will occur shortly, which may provide further insights into the comet's nature and potential risks.</p>
