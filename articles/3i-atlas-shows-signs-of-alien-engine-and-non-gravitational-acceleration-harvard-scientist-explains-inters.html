      <h2>3I/ATLAS shows signs of alien engine and non-gravitational acceleration as it passes near the Sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of non-gravitational acceleration while passing near the Sun, drawing attention from scientists and space agencies worldwide. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the object's blue hue and unexplained acceleration could indicate artificial propulsion. NASA has confirmed the non-gravitational acceleration but has denied any connection to extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and whether it is a comet or an artificial craft. NASA and other space agencies are closely monitoring the object as it approaches Earth, with observations planned for its upcoming closest pass in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is a Manhattan-sized interstellar object.</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed non-gravitational acceleration this week.</li>
    <li>The object will pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 167 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA's Acting Administrator Sean Duffy stated there is no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Observations by spacecraft have shown 3I/ATLAS brightening rapidly.</li>
    <li>Ground-based telescopes will resume observations in mid- to late-November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed as it passed near the Sun, with notable changes in its color and brightness. NASA recorded its non-gravitational acceleration this week, which indicated a major outgassing event typical of comets. The object was first noted for its unusual color change from red to green and now to blue, prompting further investigation.</p>

<p>In early October, 3I/ATLAS made a close pass near Mars, but images captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have not yet been released. NASA's Acting Administrator stated that the object is the third interstellar comet to enter the solar system.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS's closest approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2025, providing another opportunity for scientists to study it in detail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said NASA's Acting Administrator Sean Duffy regarding 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The non-gravitational acceleration might be the technological signature of an internal engine,” suggesting that the object could exhibit signs of artificial propulsion.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects, similar to 1I/‘Oumuamua, which also displayed non-gravitational acceleration without visible gas or dust. Loeb has called for continued study of such anomalies to understand their origins better and the implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<p>As a relatively rare visitor, 3I/ATLAS offers unique insights into the composition of distant planetary systems, and its unusual behavior has sparked significant scientific inquiry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS leading up to its closest approach. If no massive gas cloud forms around the object by December, it may suggest the presence of a propulsion system, prompting further investigation into its nature.</p>
