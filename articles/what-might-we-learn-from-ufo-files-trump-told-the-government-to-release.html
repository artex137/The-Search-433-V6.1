      <h2>Trump Directs Release of UFO Files Amid Growing Interest</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon and other federal agencies to identify and release files related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life, following comments from former President Barack Obama regarding the existence of aliens. This announcement was made during a press conference aboard Air Force One on Thursday. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this directive.</p>

<p>This action underscores a heightened interest from Congress and government agencies in understanding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Authorities have established frameworks to investigate these occurrences, including the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office created by the Department of Defense in 2022 and an independent study commissioned by NASA. Experts believe this release may illuminate longstanding mysteries surrounding UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump's directive to release UFO files was announced on Thursday, not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Former President Barack Obama stated aliens are real but clarified he has not seen them.</li>
    <li>Ryan Graves, former Navy pilot, has testified at congressional hearings on UAPs.</li>
    <li>The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was established in 2022 to investigate UAPs.</li>
    <li>The latest AARO report, released in late 2024, covered hundreds of UAP cases.</li>
    <li>There was no evidence found of extraterrestrial life or technology on Earth in the AARO report.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, interest in UAPs has surged, leading to several congressional hearings. In the summer of 2023, Ryan Graves testified on the implications of UAPs for national security and aerospace safety. On Thursday, Trump announced his directive for file disclosure, citing a "tremendous interest" in the subject.</p>
<p>Obama's comments regarding aliens were made during a podcast, where he acknowledged the vastness of the universe and the likelihood of life existing elsewhere. However, he emphasized that no evidence supports the idea of extraterrestrial contact with Earth during his presidency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There's been an incredible swell of reports from pilots on this issue, (but) they still don't feel comfortable reporting,” said Ryan Graves. “If the United States government, the president himself, has validated this as an issue, I think the market has no choice but to react and start to integrate this information.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Trump stated, “Well, I don't know if they're real or not. I don't have an opinion on it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Chris Impey, an astronomer at the University of Arizona, commented, “We've found thousands of exoplanets and hundreds of Earth-like exoplanets, and it projects to maybe 10 billion habitable worlds in the Milky Way Galaxy.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UFOs and UAPs has grown in recent years, leading to increased scrutiny from Congress and the establishment of dedicated offices for investigation. The latest AARO report indicated that while hundreds of cases were reviewed, most were attributed to common objects like balloons and drones. The report concluded there was no evidence of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Experts like Chris Impey caution that while the odds of microbial life may be high, intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations could be exceedingly rare, possibly located thousands of light-years away.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The release of government documents regarding UFOs is expected to take place in the near future, potentially providing more information on UAPs. Investigations into these phenomena will continue as authorities seek to understand their implications for national security and aerospace safety.</p>
