      <h2>Secret Pentagon UFO Program Revealed</h2>
<p>On December 16, 2017, The New York Times reported the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), a secret Pentagon initiative that operated from 2007 to 2012. The program, which investigated unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) that could threaten national security, received approximately <strong>$22 million</strong> in funding during its operation.</p>

<p>This revelation marks a significant shift in how unidentified aerial phenomena are acknowledged and handled by authorities. The U.S. government has shifted its stance, now recognizing the potential risks posed by UAPs and the need for further investigation. The program's findings have led to increased transparency and new protocols for reporting sightings by military personnel.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Program Duration:</strong> 2007-2012</li>
    <li><strong>Total Funding:</strong> $22 million</li>
    <li><strong>Key Sponsor:</strong> Senator Harry Reid</li>
    <li><strong>Contractor:</strong> Bigelow Aerospace</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Videos:</strong> FLIR1, Gimbal, GoFast</li>
    <li><strong>Current Office:</strong> All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The AATIP was officially established in 2007 under the U.S. Department of Defense. Its primary goal was to investigate UAPs using data from advanced military sensors, including radars and infrared cameras. In 2012, the program was terminated due to a perceived misalignment with strategic priorities. However, investigations continued through other government structures, leading to the formation of the AARO.</p>
<p>In 2021, an official report acknowledged that many cases remain unexplained, despite extensive analysis. The government has not confirmed any UAPs as extraterrestrial, citing various hypotheses, including foreign technologies and sensor artifacts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The investigations have not ceased entirely. Part of the activities were absorbed by other internal structures.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Some cases do not fit clearly into any of these categories.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 2017, discussions about UFOs were often dismissed as fringe speculation. The AATIP's public acknowledgment of UAPs has transformed the conversation into a matter of air safety and national security. Other countries, including the United Kingdom, France, and Japan, are now reviewing their own archives on unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The U.S. government continues to investigate UAPs through the AARO. Future reports and congressional hearings are expected as the military and intelligence communities seek to better understand these phenomena.</p>
