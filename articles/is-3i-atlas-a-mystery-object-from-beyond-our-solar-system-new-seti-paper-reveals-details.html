      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS a Mystery Object from Beyond Our Solar System? New SETI Paper Reveals Details</h2>

<p>A new paper from the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) has raised questions about the nature of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, discovered in early July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The object is on an escape trajectory from our solar system and is the third known interstellar visitor, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it presents an opportunity for scientists to study a potential 10-billion-year-old fragment from a distant planetary system. While many astronomers believe 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested it could be an artificial probe, igniting debate within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered: Early July 2025</li>
    <li>Detection method: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 58 km/s</li>
    <li>Eccentricity: About 6.1</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors: ʻOumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July 2025, the ATLAS telescope system detected a fast-moving object entering the solar system on an escape trajectory. The object was named 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third interstellar visitor known to date.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb and his team proposed that 3I/ATLAS may not be natural but could be an alien probe, citing its unusual traits. This claim has sparked debate, with other scientists, including SETI Institute's A.K.M. Eahsanul Haque, arguing that the object aligns with characteristics of natural comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” Loeb said, emphasizing the need for attention on the potential risks associated with the object.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Haque responded, stating, “The galactic disk, which is where most stars are, is nearly in line with the solar system’s ecliptic plane,” arguing against the notion that the object is artificial.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins the ranks of other interstellar visitors, such as ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have provided valuable insights into celestial bodies from outside our solar system. The existing debate around its nature highlights ongoing discussions in the scientific community regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life and the origins of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As research continues, astronomers will focus on studying 3I/ATLAS to gather more data. Investigations will aim to clarify its characteristics and trajectory as it approaches the Sun later this year.</p>
