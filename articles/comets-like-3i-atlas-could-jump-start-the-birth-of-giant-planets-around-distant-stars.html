      <h2>Comets like 3I/ATLAS could jump-start the birth of giant planets around distant stars</h2>

<p>Recent research has indicated that interstellar comets, such as 3I/ATLAS, may play a key role in the formation of giant planets around massive stars. These findings were reported by the BBC and suggest that comets originating from outside our solar system could serve as initial seeds for planet formation, addressing longstanding questions in current planet formation theories.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it may enhance understanding of how large planets, including those comparable to Jupiter, can form around stars like our Sun. Scientists are actively studying these rare interstellar visitors to gauge their potential impact on planetary systems in other parts of the Galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently passing through the Solar System.</li>
    <li>It is one of only three observed interstellar objects, alongside 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Interstellar comets may provide pre-formed material for planet formation.</li>
    <li>Professor Susanne Pfalzner of Forschungszentrum Jülich is leading research on this topic.</li>
    <li>Computer models suggest young stars could capture millions of interstellar objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected as it entered the Solar System, marking it as an interstellar object. Since its discovery, scientists have been studying its trajectory and composition to understand its potential role in planet formation. Research has suggested that interstellar comets could provide essential materials for forming giant planets in the disks surrounding young stars.</p>

<p>In 2017, 1I/ʻOumuamua became the first interstellar object detected in the Solar System, opening new avenues for research into these celestial bodies. Following this, 2I/Borisov was observed, and now 3I/ATLAS is under examination to reveal insights into planetary formation mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects would supply ready-made material for the formation of new planets,” said Professor Susanne Pfalzner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Interstellar object-seeded planet formation should be more efficient around these stars, providing a fast way to form giant planets,” Pfalzner added, highlighting the implications for gas giant formation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets is crucial as it addresses existing gaps in understanding how large planets form around young stars. Traditional models of planet formation struggle to explain how planets larger than one meter can develop in turbulent disks of gas and dust. By exploring alternative mechanisms, such as the role of interstellar comets, scientists aim to refine these models.</p>

<p>Prior to this research, the formation of gas giants was thought to be limited by the short lifespan of protoplanetary disks, which last only a few million years. The capture of interstellar comets may provide a solution to this challenge.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Professor Pfalzner plans to conduct further computer simulations to assess how the capture of millions of interstellar objects could influence the formation of giant planets. These studies will aim to quantify the contribution of interstellar comets to the emergence of gas giants in planetary systems beyond our Solar System.</p>
