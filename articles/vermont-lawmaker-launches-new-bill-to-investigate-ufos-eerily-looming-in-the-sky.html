      <h2>Vermont lawmaker launches new bill to investigate UFOs eerily looming in the sky</h2>

<p>A Vermont lawmaker has introduced a bill to create a task force that will investigate reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). State Rep. Troy Headrick, an Independent from Burlington, presented the bill, H.654, during a meeting of the House Government Operations Committee in Montpelier on Thursday.</p>

<p>The proposed Vermont Airspace Safety and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Task Force aims to assess safety risks related to airspace, investigate reports of unidentified objects, and collaborate with federal agencies and researchers to develop improved policies. The task force's creation comes amid growing interest in UAPs, a subject gaining traction among federal lawmakers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bill number: H.654</li>
    <li>Proposed by: State Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington</li>
    <li>Task force to include officials from the departments of public safety and transportation</li>
    <li>Additional members to include lawmakers and relevant experts</li>
    <li>Focus on reports of unknown objects with unusual performance characteristics</li>
    <li>Introduced at the request of constituent Maggie Lenz</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday, State Rep. Troy Headrick introduced bill H.654 during a House Government Operations Committee meeting in Montpelier. The bill proposes the formation of a task force to investigate UAPs and assess safety risks associated with airspace.</p>

<p>The task force would be empowered to investigate reports of unidentified objects, including the potential investigation of Lake Champlain's legendary creature, Champ. Headrick noted the increasing prevalence of drones as a practical reason for the legislation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The proliferation of drone use, this is where I see the need for data,” Headrick said during the committee meeting.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I’m certainly not saying that it’s aliens,” Lenz said. “But I do think just having the conversation here in Vermont will begin to allow for it to be taken a little bit more seriously.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The introduction of this bill follows a rise in interest in UAPs, particularly after several sightings in New Jersey in 2024 that sparked nationwide attention. The task force aims to address public safety concerns and investigate reports of unidentified objects that exhibit performance characteristics inconsistent with known technologies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The proposed bill will be reviewed by the Vermont legislature. If approved, the task force will begin work on investigating UAPs and their implications for airspace safety. Further details regarding membership and operations of the task force are not disclosed.</p>
