      <h2>Secretary Of State Marco Rubio Says UFOs Flying Over U.S. Nuclear Sites Are ‘Out Of Control’</h2>

<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has claimed that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been observed over nuclear facilities in the United States, as stated in the upcoming documentary, <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, set to release on November 21, 2025. Rubio made these remarks during the documentary's announcement, emphasizing the unusual nature of these sightings.</p>

<p>This matter has drawn attention due to its implications for national security and the ongoing discourse about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities, including the Department of Defense (DoD), have previously acknowledged the existence of these aerial phenomena and have released footage captured by U.S. Navy pilots. The Pentagon aims to clarify public misconceptions surrounding these videos and their authenticity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> features Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</li>
    <li>Rubio claims UFOs have been seen over U.S. nuclear facilities.</li>
    <li>Footage released by the DoD dates back to 2004 and 2015.</li>
    <li>Videos were leaked in 2007 and 2017, officially released on October 13, 2025.</li>
    <li>Documentary will be available on Prime Video and in select theaters including New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2004 and 2015, U.S. Navy pilots captured footage of unidentified aerial phenomena during training flights.</p>
<p>The videos were leaked to the public in 2007 and 2017 but were officially released by the Pentagon on October 13, 2025, after a thorough review.</p>
<p>The documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> featuring Rubio is scheduled for release on November 21, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities, and it’s not ours,” Rubio stated in the documentary. “These are otherworldly things that are performing maneuvers that haven’t been seen. There’s a whole fleet of them.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Rubio added, “This is so secret. There have been very few people in our entire government that have been allowed or provided access to it.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Pentagon remarked that the release of the videos was to “clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that [had] been circulating was real, or whether there is more to the videos.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings and reports of unidentified aerial phenomena have surged in recent years, prompting discussions about their implications for national security. The DoD has previously characterized these phenomena as “unidentified,” and their acknowledgment has fueled speculation about extraterrestrial life and government transparency.</p>
<p>Rubio's comments reflect a growing concern among some lawmakers regarding the seriousness with which these incidents are taken by world leaders.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the sightings and the implications for military airspace security are ongoing. The release of <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> is expected to further ignite public interest and discussion regarding UFOs and their potential implications.</p>
