      <h2>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) Glows Gold After Surviving Close Encounter with the Sun</h2>

<p>A newly discovered comet, C/2025 K1 (ATLAS), has emerged with a striking golden hue after a perilous journey near the Sun, reaching its closest point on October 8, 2025. Astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) first identified the comet in May 2025. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this cosmic event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about comets and their behavior during close encounters with the Sun. Astronomers are keen to understand how C/2025 K1 not only survived but transformed into a rare golden color, which is uncommon among comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) discovered in May 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on October 8, 2025, within 31 million miles.</li>
    <li>Comet's apparent magnitude is currently 9, making it visible with telescopes or binoculars.</li>
    <li>Expected closest point to Earth on November 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>Visible in the morning sky, particularly before sunrise, between the constellations Virgo and Leo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>May 2025: Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is discovered by astronomers at ATLAS.</p>
<p>October 8, 2025: The comet reaches perihelion, coming within 31 million miles of the Sun.</p>
<p>November 25, 2025: C/2025 K1 is expected to reach its closest point to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet was not supposed to survive its Oct. 8th perihelion. But it did survive, and now it is displaying a red/brown/golden color rarely seen in comets,” said astrophotographer Dan Bartlett, speaking to Spaceweather.com.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This comet’s survival is a testament to the sheer unpredictability of these icy travelers,” noted Dr. Amelia Harris, an astronomer studying cometary behavior.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Most comets typically display white or blue hues due to the sunlight reflecting off their icy surfaces. C/2025 K1’s golden hue is particularly puzzling, as it lacks many carbon-bearing molecules, which are usually present in comets and contribute to their color. This anomaly raises questions about the chemical composition and behavior of comets during close solar encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe C/2025 K1 as it approaches Earth. This comet presents a unique opportunity to study the relationship between a comet’s chemical composition and its color, potentially expanding our understanding of other icy bodies in the solar system.</p>
