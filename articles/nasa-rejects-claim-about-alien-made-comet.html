      <h2>NASA rejects claim about alien made comet</h2>

<p>NASA has rejected claims made by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb regarding Comet 3I/Atlas, asserting that the interstellar comet is not an artificial object created by alien intelligence. The agency stated that the comet, which is currently passing through our solar system, exhibits entirely natural characteristics.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it addresses the implications of extraterrestrial life and the study of interstellar objects. NASA confirmed that Comet 3I/Atlas does not pose a threat to Earth and continues its journey through the solar system without exhibiting any artificial characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas measures 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of 209,000 km/h, the fastest recorded for a solar system visitor.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass no closer than 170 million miles (273 million km) from Earth.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by Chile's ATLAS telescope on July 01, 2025.</li>
    <li>This marks only the third known interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 01, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered Comet 3I/Atlas. Following its discovery, Avi Loeb speculated that the comet could be an artificial object due to its unusual trajectory and lack of gaseous tails. NASA responded by affirming the comet's natural characteristics and debunking claims of alien technology.</p>

<p>NASA solar system expert Tom Statler stated that all comets exhibit unpredictable behaviors, which can sometimes lead to surprising brightness changes. Despite Loeb's initial claims, NASA has maintained that evidence overwhelmingly points to the comet being a natural body.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. Evidence overwhelmingly points to this object being a natural body,” said NASA solar system expert Tom Statler.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb acknowledged, “My alien technology hypothesis was likely incorrect but defended it as valuable scientific speculation that challenges conventional thinking.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects. Scientists believe that studying such objects can provide unprecedented opportunities to learn about materials from other star systems. This discovery follows previous instances where interstellar objects have been detected, increasing the scientific community's interest in their origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas as it travels through the solar system, ensuring that it poses no threat to Earth or other planets. Research efforts will focus on understanding the comet's natural behavior and characteristics.</p>
