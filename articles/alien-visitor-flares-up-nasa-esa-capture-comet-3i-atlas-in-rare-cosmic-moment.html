      <h2>Alien visitor flares up: NASA, ESA capture comet 3I/ATLAS in rare cosmic moment</h2>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have released new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is displaying increased activity as it approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19. The comet is currently about 170 million miles away, but its brightening has generated significant interest among scientists.</p>

<p>The observation of comet 3I/ATLAS is important as it provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. This comet is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the inner solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Researchers are racing to gather final observations before the comet moves out of reach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently about 170 million miles away from Earth.</li>
    <li>Discovered in late June 2023 and confirmed in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at nearly 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured images on November 30, 2023, from about 178 million miles away.</li>
    <li>ESA's Juice orbiter took images on November 2, 2023, from approximately 41 million miles away.</li>
    <li>More than a dozen spacecraft are currently observing the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in late June 2023 and confirmed as an interstellar object in July 2023. It has since traveled past Mars and the sun at high speed. NASA obtained a significant image of the comet on November 30, 2023, while ESA's Juice orbiter captured its own image on November 2, 2023. As the comet approaches Earth, it has begun to exhibit increased activity, with new features such as a glowing nucleus and dual tails recorded.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These observations are crucial for understanding the chemistry and processes shaping planetary systems around other stars,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of only three interstellar objects ever recorded. Its passage through the solar system offers a unique chance for scientists to study materials from beyond our solar system. Previous interstellar visitors, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the nature of celestial bodies originating from other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet nears its closest approach, NASA and ESA plan to continue their observations. The James Webb Space Telescope is also expected to conduct observations later this month. Further data collection will be crucial for understanding the comet's composition and behavior before it disappears into deep space.</p>
