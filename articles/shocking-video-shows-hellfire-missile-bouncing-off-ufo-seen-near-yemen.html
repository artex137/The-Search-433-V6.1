      <h2>Shocking Video Shows Hellfire Missile Bouncing Off UFO Seen Near Yemen</h2>

<p>During a House Oversight subcommittee meeting on October 30, 2024, lawmakers viewed a video showing a U.S. drone firing a Hellfire missile at a mysterious orb off the coast of Yemen. The missile struck the object but did not destroy it, leading to concerns about technology exceeding known military capabilities. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The video, captured by an MQ-9 Reaper drone, has raised significant questions among lawmakers about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and their implications for national security. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is currently investigating the footage, which was obtained from a whistleblower and is undergoing independent review. Lawmakers have called for increased transparency and further research into UAPs, particularly in light of rising military tensions in Yemen.</p>

    <li>Video presented during a House Oversight subcommittee meeting on October 30, 2024.</li>
    <li>Footage shows a U.S. drone firing a Hellfire missile at an orb off the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>Missile impact did not destroy the object, which continued in its trajectory.</li>
    <li>The video was recorded by an MQ-9 Reaper drone.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office is investigating the incident.</li>
    <li>No evidence of extraterrestrial technology has been found, according to AARO.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, during a House Oversight subcommittee meeting, Rep. Eric Burlison presented the video of a U.S. drone firing a Hellfire missile at a mysterious orb. The missile hit the object, but it remained intact. Witnesses at the meeting indicated that no known U.S. technology could withstand such a strike.</p>

<p>The footage has been linked to previous unexplained incidents, including the 2015 "Go Fast" video, which was determined to be an optical illusion involving a weather balloon. The ongoing investigation into this recent video aims to clarify the capabilities of the object and its implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We need to understand what this means for our national security,” said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla. “If this is a technology we don’t recognize, we must investigate further.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader discussion regarding UAPs and their potential threats. The Pentagon's AARO has been tasked with investigating UAP reports but has not confirmed any evidence of advanced foreign capabilities or extraterrestrial technology. The recent video adds to the urgency for transparency and research into UAPs, especially amid increasing military tensions in regions like Yemen.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ongoing review of the Yemen video and other whistleblower reports will continue to influence congressional oversight and public transparency efforts regarding UAPs. Further investigations are expected as lawmakers push for clarity on these phenomena.</p>
