      <h2>Professor Says Mysterious Interstellar Object May Be Releasing Sentinels Around Jupiter</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on November 13, 2023, coming within approximately 170 million miles of the planet. Three months later, it is predicted to pass within about 53 million miles of Jupiter on March 16, 2024, as it follows a highly eccentric path through the solar system.</p>

<p>This potential close encounter with Jupiter has raised interest among astronomers, particularly Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who has suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft. Loeb has pointed out that recent “non-gravitational acceleration” may have altered the object's trajectory toward a significant area in Jupiter's orbit. Meanwhile, NASA has expressed skepticism about Loeb's claims, emphasizing that evidence points to 3I/ATLAS being a comet made of ice and dust.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: November 13, 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2024</li>
    <li>Distance from Jupiter: Approximately 53 million miles</li>
    <li>Distance from Jupiter's Hill radius: Approximately 160,000 miles</li>
    <li>NASA's Juno spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the past month, 3I/ATLAS has undergone a significant change in trajectory due to “non-gravitational acceleration” during its closest approach to the Sun. This adjustment has allowed the object to come closer to Jupiter than previously expected.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb has indicated that this new trajectory could enable 3I/ATLAS to enter Jupiter's Hill radius, which is the boundary within which the gas giant can maintain an object in orbit. He has suggested that if the object is indeed an alien spacecraft, it may be positioned to deploy technological devices around Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If we find technological satellites of Jupiter that we did not send, it would imply that Jupiter is of interest to an extraterrestrial civilization,” Loeb wrote.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA associate administrator Amit Kshatriya stated, “The evidence points to 3I/ATLAS being a natural comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has long advocated for the theory that 3I/ATLAS may be an artificial object, which has drawn criticism from much of the scientific community. NASA's position is based on substantial evidence that supports the idea of 3I/ATLAS as a comet made of ice and dust, contrary to Loeb's hypothesis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's Juno spacecraft is set to observe 3I/ATLAS more closely during its upcoming approach to Jupiter in March 2024. The findings from this observation may further clarify the nature of the interstellar object.</p>
