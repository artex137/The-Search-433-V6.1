      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-31 02:58 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>This week, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in 2019, has drawn attention as it races through our solar system, set to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29 to 30, 2023. This rare cosmic visitor is notable for its bright tail of ice and dust, which has excited scientists worldwide. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>Authorities and scientists have emphasized the significance of 3I/ATLAS as a unique opportunity for research and public engagement. The comet serves as a reminder of the vastness of the universe and the potential for new discoveries, inspiring interest and innovation in fields like astronomy and technology in Zimbabwe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS travels at 61 kilometres per second.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29 to 30, 2023, at a distance of 130 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The comet's tail is approximately 100,000 kilometres wide.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>It will be 170 million kilometres away from Earth in December 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile first spotted 3I/ATLAS as it moved rapidly through the solar system. Initial observations suggested it was a typical comet, but calculations later confirmed its interstellar origin.</p>
<p>In July 2023, the comet passed Jupiter, using its gravity for a slingshot effect. On October 3, it safely passed Mars, missing the planet by 30 million kilometres.</p>
<p>Scientists have been monitoring 3I/ATLAS using major telescopes, including NASA's Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a reminder that the universe is full of surprises,” said a spokesperson from the University of Zimbabwe. “It opens up opportunities for young scientists and innovators.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two similar interstellar comets have been recorded, making its discovery particularly significant for scientific research. The rarity of such events highlights the importance of advancements in technology and collaboration among nations in space exploration.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe has potential in the field of astronomy, with local universities capable of contributing to African sky-watching projects and training students in data analysis related to space discoveries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will gather more data from ongoing observations. Educational initiatives and public engagement activities are expected to increase, fostering curiosity and interest in astronomy among Zimbabweans.</p>
