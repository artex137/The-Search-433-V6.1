      <h2>Is cyanide from 3I/ATLAS raining down on Earth as it passes by? Harvard scientist weighs in</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, has raised concerns about whether comet 3I/ATLAS could be delivering toxic debris to Earth during its fly-by on December 19. He speculated that the gas plume surrounding the comet contains cyanide and hydrogen cyanide, substances known for their toxicity. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights the potential risks associated with interstellar objects passing close to Earth. Authorities and scientists are monitoring the situation closely to ensure public safety and to understand the implications of such fly-bys.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately <strong>170 million miles</strong> away from Earth during this time.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has referenced observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile.</li>
    <li>Loeb noted that the gas plume around 3I/ATLAS contains <strong>hydrogen cyanide</strong> and methanol.</li>
    <li>Solar wind is theorized to prevent any potentially harmful payload from reaching Earth.</li>
    <li>Loeb estimates that less than a million large objects have been released from 3I/ATLAS in recent months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, sparking discussions among scientists about the potential risks associated with its gas plume. Avi Loeb shared insights regarding the composition of the comet and the implications of its proximity to Earth.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2023, ALMA detected the presence of methanol and hydrogen cyanide around 3I/ATLAS, leading to further speculation about the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Will any of the material shed by 3I/ATLAS arrive on Earth?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb explained, “Hydrogen cyanide at large concentrations is a poison,” referencing its historical use as a chemical weapon during World War I.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb noted, “Given the mass loss rate measured by the Webb Space Telescope, the gas around 3I/ATLAS would be swept up by the solar wind at a distance of just a few million kilometers from 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time scientists have raised concerns about the potential hazards posed by celestial bodies passing close to Earth. Previous incidents involving asteroids and comets have prompted discussions on planetary defense and monitoring strategies. The study of 3I/ATLAS continues to contribute to the understanding of such interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter on March 16, 2026. Ongoing research will focus on the comet's behavior and any potential risks it may pose to Earth.</p>
