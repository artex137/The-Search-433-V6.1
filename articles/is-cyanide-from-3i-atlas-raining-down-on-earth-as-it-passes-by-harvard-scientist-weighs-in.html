      <h2>Is cyanide from 3I/ATLAS raining down on Earth as it passes by? Harvard scientist weighs in</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, has raised concerns about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. He has speculated that debris from the comet may contain toxic materials, including cyanide, potentially posing a risk to our planet.</p>

<p>Loeb's remarks come as authorities and scientists monitor the comet's trajectory and its effects. He referenced observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, which detected methanol and hydrogen cyanide in 3I/ATLAS. While he acknowledged the potential for harmful materials, he believes solar wind will likely prevent these substances from reaching Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has speculated that 3I/ATLAS may release toxic materials, including hydrogen cyanide.</li>
    <li>ALMA detected methanol and hydrogen cyanide in the comet over the fall.</li>
    <li>Loeb theorizes that solar wind will prevent harmful debris from reaching Earth.</li>
    <li>Debris larger than three feet is unlikely to impact Earth due to the comet's off-gassing speed and distance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the fall of 2025, observations from ALMA detected cyanide and methanol in the gas plume surrounding 3I/ATLAS. On December 19, the comet made its closest approach to Earth, prompting Loeb to express concerns over the potential for toxic debris. He theorized that solar wind would mitigate these risks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Will any of the material shed by 3I/ATLAS arrive on Earth?” Loeb asked in a post on Medium.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Hydrogen cyanide at large concentrations is a poison,” Loeb stated, referencing the gas's historical use as a chemical weapon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Given the mass loss rate of 3I/ATLAS, there are less than a million of these large objects released in recent months,” Loeb noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of comets have raised concerns about the materials they may contain. 3I/ATLAS is particularly noted for its unusual trajectory, which has led to speculation about its origins and potential for carrying extraterrestrial materials. Loeb has previously suggested that the comet may have artificial origins, further fueling public interest and debate.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter on March 16, 2026. They will analyze any potential interactions and assess the comet’s impact on the solar system.</p>
