      <h2>3I/ATLAS reaches closest point to the Sun and reveals composition with carbon dioxide</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its perihelion on Wednesday, October 29, 2025, at a distance of 204 million kilometers from the Sun. The event occurred at 8:47 am Brasílian time, placing the comet 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun. Astronomers from NASA and ESA have monitored the comet to analyze its activity under solar influence.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides insights into the comet's origins and composition, which includes a high concentration of carbon dioxide. The monitoring efforts have allowed scientists to gather data about the comet's stability and structure, enhancing understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Sun:</strong> 204 million km (1.36 AU)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 210,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Core diameter:</strong> Up to 5.6 km</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness at perihelion:</strong> Increased to magnitude 9</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> 269 million km on December 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile. Initial visibility occurred on July 1, allowing for tracking ahead of the solar conjunction on October 21. The comet exhibited activity as early as May 2025, when it was 6.4 AU from the Sun.</p>

<p>On October 29, the comet reached its perihelion, where solar heat caused ice sublimation and the formation of a visible coma and tail. Observations from various telescopes confirmed its stability and activity during this period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its high carbon dioxide levels, provides important clues about its formation in distant systems,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to visit the Solar System. Its composition differs significantly from local comets, suggesting it originated in an ancient galactic thick disk. Previous interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, have also been studied for their unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following perihelion, 3I/ATLAS will pass 97 million km from Venus on November 3, 2025. Observations will continue as the comet moves away from the Sun, with additional monitoring planned by the International Asteroid Warning Network to refine orbital measurements.</p>
