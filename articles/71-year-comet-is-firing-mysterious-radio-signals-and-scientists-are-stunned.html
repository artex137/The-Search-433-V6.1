      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Emits Mysterious Radio Signals</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has begun emitting mysterious radio signals, according to scientists who have observed this Halley-type comet. The comet, which returns to the centre of the solar system every 71 years, has sparked interest within the scientific community regarding its unusual activity.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it adds to the understanding of cometary behaviour and the nature of radio emissions from celestial bodies. Researchers are currently investigating the source and implications of these signals, which could provide insights into the comet's composition and activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is a Halley-type comet.</li>
    <li>The comet has a return period of 71 years.</li>
    <li>Scientists have detected radio signals from this comet.</li>
    <li>Previous observations have noted similar signals from other cosmic bodies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Scientists have recently observed the radio signals emitted by comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet's return to the solar system occurs every 71 years, with its current period marking another opportunity for study.</p>
<p>As radio signals from various parts of the universe have been detected in the past, the current findings regarding 3I/ATLAS contribute to ongoing research into the characteristics of comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The radio signals from 3I/ATLAS are intriguing and may reveal more about the comet's nature,” said a spokesperson from the research team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this, radio signals from other comets and celestial bodies have been documented. The detection of these signals plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics and composition of comets within our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study the signals from comet 3I/ATLAS to uncover more about its characteristics and behaviour during its current return to the solar system.</p>
