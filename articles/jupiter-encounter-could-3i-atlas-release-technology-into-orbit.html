      <h2>Jupiter Encounter: Could 3I/ATLAS Release Technology Into Orbit?</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching a close encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026, raising questions about its trajectory and potential to release technology into orbit. Current observations suggest that the comet’s path may not be purely natural, prompting discussions among astronomers about its behavior as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant because it could provide insights into orbital dynamics and the possibilities of artificial satellites being deployed around Jupiter. Researchers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS's trajectory, as its precise alignment with Jupiter's Hill radius could indicate a planned passage rather than a random trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is predicted to encounter Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
  <li>The minimum distance from Jupiter at perijove is forecasted to be 53.445 (+/- 0.06) million kilometres.</li>
  <li>NASA's JPL Horizons website has revised the comet's radial acceleration component several times leading up to the encounter.</li>
  <li>Observations indicate that 3I/ATLAS’s brightness has increased, suggesting changes in its outgassing behavior.</li>
  <li>The comet was hidden from terrestrial telescopes during its perihelion passage, limiting observational data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2025, the radial acceleration of 3I/ATLAS was recorded at 1.6×10<sup>−10</sup> au per day². By November 24, this value had decreased to 4×10<sup>−11</sup> au per day², as reported by News.Az.</p>

<p>Following these changes, NASA's JPL Horizons revised the acceleration value downward by a factor of six to 6.8×10<sup>−12</sup> au per day², indicating a new model for the comet's behavior.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches its perijove, scientists are gathering data to determine whether its trajectory aligns with Jupiter's Hill radius, which is crucial for understanding potential satellite deployment.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The insistence of the Vatican on the Earth being at the centre of the solar system did not change the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. The same applies here; the new model will not change the actual trajectory of 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Hill radius is a critical boundary where Jupiter's gravity dominates over the Sun's influence. If 3I/ATLAS's perijove distance aligns closely with this radius, it could facilitate the release of technological devices into stable orbits around the planet.</p>

<p>Previous encounters with celestial bodies have led to advancements in our understanding of orbital mechanics. This encounter is expected to contribute to ongoing discussions about the potential for artificial satellites in the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its perijove on March 16, 2026. Data from spacecraft such as Juno, Juice, or Psyche will be instrumental in confirming the comet's trajectory and the implications for satellite deployment around Jupiter.</p>
