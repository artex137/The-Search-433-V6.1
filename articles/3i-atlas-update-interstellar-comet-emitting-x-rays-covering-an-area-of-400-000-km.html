      <h2>3I/ATLAS update: Interstellar comet emitting X-rays covering an area of 400,000 km</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed emitting X-rays, according to researchers from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The comet was observed over two days, from November 26 to 28, 2023, with emissions covering an area of approximately 400,000 km around its nucleus.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the detection of X-rays from the third interstellar visitor recorded in our solar system. Scientists aim to understand the comet's behavior and its interaction with solar wind, which may provide insights into the composition of its gaseous envelope.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed emitting X-rays from November 26-28, 2023.</li>
    <li>Observation conducted by JAXA’s X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM).</li>
    <li>Effective exposure time for observations: 17 hours.</li>
    <li>X-ray emissions cover an area of approximately 400,000 km, or 5 arcminutes.</li>
    <li>Comet reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, and has intrigued the scientific community since. The comet was observed moving at a speed of 200,000 km/hr, indicating a hyperbolic trajectory that confirms it is traveling from outside the solar system.</p>
<p>On October 2-3, the comet flew past Mars, where it was captured by NASA and ESA orbiters. Following this, it reached perihelion on October 29, displaying non-gravitational acceleration and a sudden brightness increase.</p>
<p>Currently, the comet is en route to Earth, with its closest approach scheduled for December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This provides an important clue that the observed emission may indeed arise from charge-exchange interactions between the cometary gas and the solar wind,” researchers from JAXA noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this observation, comets have been known to emit X-rays due to interactions between their gaseous clouds and solar wind. The study of such emissions helps scientists understand the physical processes occurring in and around comets.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Each of these objects has provided unique insights into the dynamics of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from the observations to further understand the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and its interactions with solar wind as it approaches Earth.</p>
