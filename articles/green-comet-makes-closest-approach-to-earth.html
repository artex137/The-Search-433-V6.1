      <h2>Green comet makes closest approach to Earth</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, 3I/Atlas, has made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing at a distance of 170 million miles. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This occurrence is significant as it marks only the third time that a comet from outside the Solar System has been identified. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are using the fly-by to conduct a planetary defence exercise involving 21 countries. This exercise focuses on impact probability modeling and emergency coordination.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Location in the sky: Constellation Leo</li>
    <li>Time of highest visibility: Around 5 AM on December 19</li>
    <li>Number of countries involved in the exercise: 21</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The following key events have occurred:</p>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas was discovered by amateur astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (Atlas).</li>
    <li>The comet has been gradually growing brighter as it approaches Earth.</li>
    <li>The planetary defence exercise is coordinated by the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While it poses no threat, comet 3I/Atlas presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and high interest to the scientific community,” said an IAWN spokesman.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Only two other interstellar objects have been spotted in our Solar System prior to 3I/Atlas. The first, Oumuamua, was observed in 2017 and exhibited unusual acceleration. The second, 2I/Borisov, was identified in 2019 and is believed to have originated near a red dwarf star. Experts believe that studying interstellar comets can provide valuable insights into conditions beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it moves away from the Sun and Earth. The planetary defence exercise aims to improve capabilities for measuring comet positions and enhancing emergency response coordination.</p>
