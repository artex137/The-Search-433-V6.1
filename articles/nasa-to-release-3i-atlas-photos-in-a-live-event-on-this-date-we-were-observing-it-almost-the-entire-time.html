      <h2>Nasa to release 3I/ATLAS photos in a live event on November 19</h2>

<p>Nasa will hold a live event on November 19 at 3 p.m. EST to release images and data of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which the agency gathered during the recent government shutdown. The event will take place at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>

<p>This release comes after a month-long pause in updates from NASA regarding the comet, which is only the third known interstellar visitor. The agency aims to provide comprehensive information gathered by various missions, addressing public interest and scientific inquiries regarding the comet's behavior and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date and Time:</strong> November 19 at 3 p.m. EST</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Public Access:</strong> Available on NASA+, NASA app, NASA website, YouTube channel, and Amazon Prime</li>
    <li><strong>Key Officials Present:</strong> Amit Kshatriya, Nicky Fox, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, Tom Statler</li>
    <li><strong>Last Update:</strong> October 1, prior to closest approach to Mars</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA stopped providing updates on October 1, coinciding with the period when 3I/ATLAS was expected to make its closest approach to Mars. This silence lasted until the announcement of the live event on November 19, prompting widespread inquiries from astronomers and the public.</p>

<p>During the government shutdown, NASA ceased all communications regarding the comet, which led to concerns and speculation within the scientific community and the public. The upcoming event aims to clarify these uncertainties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"NASA will host a live event at 3 p.m. EST, Wednesday, Nov. 19, to share imagery of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS collected by a number of the agency’s missions,"</blockquote> said NASA in a release.

<blockquote>"Assets within NASA’s science missions give the United States the unique capability to observe 3I/ATLAS almost the entire time it passes through our celestial neighbourhood,"</blockquote> the agency added.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The release of data on 3I/ATLAS is significant as it follows a trend of increasing interest in interstellar objects. The comet's approach has sparked discussions about the potential for similar future encounters and the scientific opportunities they present. Previous incidents of government shutdowns have also led to lapses in scientific communication, raising concerns about transparency in space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will provide detailed images and data on 3I/ATLAS during the live event, which may clarify many of the questions raised during the shutdown. This event marks a pivotal moment for scientists and the public to gain insight into the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>
