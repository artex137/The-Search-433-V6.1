      <h2>Frequent influx of purported UFO footage: Professor Jayaratne</h2>

<p>Professor Chandana Jayaratne, head of the Department of Physics at the University of Colombo, has reported a regular submission of videos claiming to show Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) in Sri Lanka. His comments come after a video circulated on social media, allegedly depicting a UFO sighting near the Voice of America (VOA) transmission centre in Iranawila, which occurred in the early hours of January 27, 2023.</p>

<p>This situation has raised interest among both the public and scientific communities. Authorities, including the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies, are evaluating these reports to understand the nature of these sightings and their implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> January 27, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Iranawila, Sri Lanka</li>
    <li><strong>Time of sighting:</strong> Approximately 3:00 a.m.</li>
    <li><strong>Witness:</strong> A shrimp farmer operating near the VOA facility</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from VOA:</strong> About 500 metres northwest</li>
    <li><strong>Duration of sighting:</strong> Observed for around 15 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 27, 2023, at approximately 3:00 a.m., a shrimp farmer noticed a blinking light in the sky while working near the VOA transmission centre in Iranawila. He attempted to signal the object with a torch. After about fifteen minutes, the light appeared to move towards him, prompting him to turn off the torch and flee the area. He alerted a colleague at the farm cottage, and both men witnessed the light following them into the bushes. The light reportedly became stationary in the sky after they ceased signaling.</p>
<p>The farmer's colleague managed to record a video of the incident, capturing two illuminated objects in the sky around 5:45 a.m.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“After about fifteen minutes, the light started moving towards my direction. It looked like some kind of ship, but its shape was not clear,”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When it came very fast towards me, I switched off the torch and started running,”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The light followed us towards the bushes. Once we switched off the torch, the object stopped moving and remained stationary in the sky,”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We stayed hidden until around 5:45 a.m., when we noticed two illuminated objects in the sky,”</blockquote>
<p>— Statements from the shrimp farmer.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Professor Jayaratne's comments highlight a growing trend in UFO sightings reported across the globe. The incident in Iranawila adds to a series of similar reports in Sri Lanka, where local authorities and scientific institutions are now taking these claims seriously. The increasing accessibility of technology, such as smartphones, has enabled more individuals to capture and share these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to investigate the video footage and other reports of UFO sightings. They aim to determine the legitimacy of these claims and assess any potential implications for public safety and scientific understanding.</p>
