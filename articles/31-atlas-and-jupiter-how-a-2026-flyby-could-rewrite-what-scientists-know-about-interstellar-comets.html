      <h2>31/ATLAS and Jupiter: How a 2026 Flyby Could Rewrite What Scientists Know About Interstellar Comets</h2>

<p>In March 2026, the interstellar comet 31/ATLAS will pass within approximately 33.3 million miles of Jupiter. This encounter has been described by astronomers as a once-in-a-generation natural experiment that could reshape current models of comet physics and planetary system formation.</p>

<p>The significance of this flyby lies in the immense gravity and intense particle environment of Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Researchers aim to observe how 31/ATLAS, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, responds to conditions it has never encountered before. Scientists anticipate that this event will provide valuable insights into how giant planets may influence interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 31/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is traveling at over 130,000 miles per hour on a hyperbolic trajectory.</li>
    <li>The flyby of Jupiter is scheduled for March 2026.</li>
    <li>Jupiter's magnetosphere will provide a unique environment for study.</li>
    <li>NASA's Juno spacecraft will observe the comet during the flyby.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>31/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile. The comet is currently on a hyperbolic trajectory and is expected to pass Jupiter in March 2026. During this close encounter, researchers will analyze the comet's behavior under Jupiter's gravitational influence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This flyby provides a unique opportunity to study how interstellar objects react to strong gravitational perturbations,” said a lead researcher involved in the project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Only three interstellar objects have been confirmed in our solar system prior to 31/ATLAS, making this comet exceptionally rare. Previous studies have indicated that giant planets can significantly impact the structure and behavior of nearby celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the flyby in March 2026, scientists will analyze data collected by the Juno spacecraft and other Earth-based telescopes to understand the effects of Jupiter's gravity and magnetic field on 31/ATLAS.</p>
