      <h2>Two spacecraft will pass right through comet 3I/ATLAS' tail</h2>

<p>Two European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft, Hera and Europa Clipper, are set to fly through the tail of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in late October and early November 2023, according to a new study by researchers at the Finnish Meteorological Institute and ESA. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This flyby is significant because it provides a rare opportunity to study the comet's tail, which has been expanding since the comet's discovery in early June. The spacecraft are not equipped for this specific mission, but scientists are hoping to collect valuable data on the ions from the comet's tail as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been active since its discovery in June 2023.</li>
    <li>Hera will pass through the tail between October 25th and November 1st, 2023.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper will pass through the tail between October 30th and November 6th, 2023.</li>
    <li>The tail of the comet is reported to be growing and is expected to reach perihelion on October 29th, 2023.</li>
    <li>Hera will be approximately 8.2 million km from the tail's central axis, while Europa Clipper will be about 8 million km away.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper has instruments capable of detecting ions and magnetic field changes in the tail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in early June 2023 and has shown significant activity since then. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun, or perihelion, on October 29th, 2023. Hera and Europa Clipper are scheduled to make their passes through the comet's tail in late October and early November 2023.</p>

<p>Both spacecraft are currently en route to their respective missions, with Hera headed to Didymos-Dimorphos and Europa Clipper set to study Europa, one of Jupiter's moons.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Sometimes science means doing the best with what you have, and in this case, these two spacecraft are our best bet to study the tail of an interstellar comet,” said Samuel Grand, co-author of the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event marks a unique opportunity in space exploration as it could be the first time humanity samples the tail of an interstellar comet. The previous understanding of cometary tails and their composition may be expanded through this mission.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Mission controllers for Hera and Europa Clipper will assess the feasibility of conducting observations during their flybys. The success of this mission could lead to new insights into the composition of interstellar comets.</p>
