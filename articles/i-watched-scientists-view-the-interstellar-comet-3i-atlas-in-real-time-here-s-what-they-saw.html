      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Observed in Real Time at Gemini South Observatory</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in real time at the Gemini South Observatory in Chile during a live webcast event on July 1, 2025. The comet, discovered by the Deep Random Survey remote telescope, is the third known interstellar object and presents a unique opportunity for astronomers.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it allows scientists to study the chemical composition of the comet, which could provide insights into the building blocks of other solar systems. The Gemini South team used the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) and the new Gemini High-resolution Optical Spectrograph (GHOST) to gather data on the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Location of Observation:</strong> Gemini South Observatory, Chile</li>
  <li><strong>Instruments Used:</strong> GMOS, GHOST</li>
  <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Comet's Nucleus Size:</strong> Estimated to be less than 1.86 miles (3 kilometers)</li>
  <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Comet:</strong> 2I/Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The live webcast event began with scientists calibrating the telescopes at Gemini South. The team discussed the rarity of interstellar objects, with astronomer Karen Meech emphasizing the importance of the observation. After calibrations, the team aimed to capture images of 3I/ATLAS, hoping to confirm its chemical composition.</p>

<p>During the event, scientists reported that previous observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope indicated that 3I/ATLAS is rich in carbon dioxide, differing from its predecessor, 2I/Borisov. The event concluded with the first images of the comet showing a developing tail, confirming its classification as a classic comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “Interstellar objects are building blocks of other solar systems that got kicked completely out of their home star just by chance passing through ours,” said Karen Meech from the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Hawai'i.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  “Once these objects get too faint to see, they will never be seen again,” Meech added, highlighting the urgency of studying 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS follows the detection of 2I/Borisov, the second interstellar comet, which provided valuable information on the composition of such objects. The study of interstellar comets is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA scientists are currently discussing whether existing spacecraft can be repurposed to observe 3I/ATLAS after it passes behind the sun in October 2025. Observations are expected to resume in November when the comet re-emerges, potentially providing further insights into its activity and chemical composition.</p>
