      <h2>NASA data shows 3I/ATLAS suddenly sped up, changed path after perihelion</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that comet 3I/ATLAS has increased its speed and altered its trajectory following its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2023. The comet is now moving towards Earth at a speed of approximately 244,000 km/hr, up from 209,000 km/hr when it was first discovered in July.</p>

<p>This change in speed and direction raises questions among scientists about the forces at play. NASA has suggested that the Sun's gravity could have influenced the comet's path, but other researchers remain uncertain. The space agency has yet to release images captured of 3I/ATLAS from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Speed increased from 209,000 km/hr to approximately 244,000 km/hr.</li>
    <li>NASA reported a sudden shift in the comet's course right after perihelion.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to become visible from Earth soon.</li>
    <li>Best images of the comet are anticipated by late November and December.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2023. Following its discovery, the comet traveled towards perihelion, reaching its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023. NASA data indicates that shortly after this event, the comet sped up and changed direction, moving toward Earth.</p>

<p>Currently, 3I/ATLAS is not visible from Earth due to its position behind the Sun's glare. However, it is expected to become visible soon, allowing for further observation and analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The course of 3I/ATLAS has suddenly shifted beyond gravity's control,” NASA reportedly confirmed. “This happened right after perihelion.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Scientists have speculated about the potential for 3I/ATLAS to contain a significant cloud of gas and dust. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet could have at least a 5 billion-ton cloud surrounding it. However, there is currently no evidence to confirm this, which raises questions about the comet's classification as a typical comet.</p>

<p>There are indications that the comet may have experienced a mass loss of at least 13% near the Sun, which could lead to a significant release of gas and dust. This phenomenon could explain the unexpected increase in speed, although this remains unverified.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to use the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the comet further. Observations in the coming months will help scientists determine the composition of 3I/ATLAS and clarify the mechanisms behind its unexpected changes in speed and trajectory.</p>
