      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows extended halo and distinct jet features</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed exhibiting an extended halo and multiple jet structures following its perihelion passage on October 29, 2025. Observations conducted by M. Jäger, G. Rhemann, and E. Prosperi on November 8, 2025, indicate the comet displayed a bright halo extending approximately half a million kilometers into space, with no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides new data on the physical characteristics and dynamic processes of 3I/ATLAS after its closest approach to the Sun. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has emphasized the importance of studying the comet during this period, as it allows for analysis of its behavior and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 8, 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: approximately 203 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Distance from Venus: approximately 97 million kilometers in early November</li>
    <li>Projected distance from Earth: 267 million kilometers by December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026, at about 54 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Number of jets identified: at least seven</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, marking its closest point to the Sun. Following this, the comet began its outward journey through the Solar System. On November 8, 2025, a team of observers recorded the comet displaying an extended halo and multiple jets, providing vital data for further analysis.</p>
<p>In early November, 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass approximately 97 million kilometers from Venus. By December 19, 2025, it will approach within 267 million kilometers of Earth. The comet is anticipated to reach its closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Perihelion represents a critical phase for studying interstellar objects, as solar heating can trigger physical transformations or fragmentation."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb further noted, "If 3I/ATLAS’s acceleration were entirely natural, it would likely result from volatile materials being released."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation follows a growing interest in interstellar objects, particularly after the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. The study of 3I/ATLAS may offer insights into the composition and behavior of such celestial bodies, which are believed to originate from outside the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing studies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, with additional observations expected from terrestrial telescopes and possibly spacecraft. Researchers aim to uncover the processes causing the observed emissions and further analyze the comet’s physical nature and composition.</p>
