      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is turning bright green: Scientists explain why</h2>

<p>A 7-mile-wide interstellar comet, nicknamed 3I/ATLAS, has been observed glowing bright green as it travels through space. First detected in July, the comet is currently speeding inward at over 210,000 kilometres per hour and is expected to pass close to Mars next month before swinging by the sun in late October.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it offers a rare opportunity for scientists to observe an interstellar object. Authorities and astronomers are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and composition, noting its unusual green coloration, which has sparked interest and excitement among both professionals and amateur astronomers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 7 miles wide.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at over 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>It was first detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass Mars in mid-October 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will swing by the sun later in October.</li>
    <li>It is expected to re-emerge in December on the opposite side of its orbit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023, marking the beginning of its journey toward the inner solar system. As it approaches, astronomers have noted its bright green appearance, which has intrigued the scientific community. The comet is set to skim past Mars next month, followed by a close encounter with the sun later in October.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The universe doesn’t give out many neon-green postcards, so this one has scientists watching very closely,” said an unnamed astronomer, highlighting the rare nature of this comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Green comets are a rare sight, typically caused by the presence of dicarbon or other gases released as comets heat up near the sun. In 2023 and 2024, several other comets have exhibited similar green hues, making 3I/ATLAS part of a fascinating trend in celestial observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars and the sun, analyzing its composition and behavior. Observations from telescopes will aim to determine the source of its green coloration as the comet continues on its trajectory through the solar system.</p>
