      <h2>ESA’s interplanetary missions to observe interstellar comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has initiated interplanetary missions to observe the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which was flagged by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on 1 July 2025. The comet is currently on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, making direct observations impossible. However, ESA's Mars orbiters will observe the comet during its close approach to Mars, scheduled for 3 October 2025.</p>

<p>This mission is significant as it allows scientists to study the characteristics of 3I/Atlas, the third known interstellar object to enter the Solar System. ESA plans to utilize its Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Orbiter to gather data on the comet as it approaches within 30 million kilometres of Mars. Following this, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will continue observations in November.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will approach within 30 million km of Mars on 3 October 2025.</li>
    <li>ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Orbiter will observe the comet from 1 to 7 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Juice will observe the comet from 2 to 25 November 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the Sun will be at a distance of 1.4 AU around 30 October 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas poses no threat to Earth, with a closest approach of about 1.8 AU.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) flagged comet 3I/Atlas as it began its approach to the Solar System. The comet is currently on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth.</p>

<p>On 3 October 2025, the comet will make its closest approach to Mars, allowing ESA's Mars orbiters to begin their observations. Following this, from 2 to 25 November 2025, the Juice spacecraft will study the comet using advanced instruments.</p>

<p>The closest approach of 3I/Atlas to the Sun is expected to occur around 30 October 2025, and the comet will reappear on the other side of the Sun by early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a unique opportunity to observe an interstellar visitor and gain insights into its composition and behaviour,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar object to visit the Solar System, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. While 'Oumuamua was a rapidly tumbling asteroid, both Borisov and Atlas are classified as comets.</p>

<p>The study of interstellar objects is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of our Solar System and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches Mars and the Sun. Observations will resume from Earth-based astronomical instruments once the comet reappears in early December 2025.</p>
