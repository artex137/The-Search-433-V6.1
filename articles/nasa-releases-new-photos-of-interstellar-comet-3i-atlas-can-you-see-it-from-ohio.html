      <h2>NASA releases new photos of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Can you see it from Ohio?</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS, which is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet, confirmed to have originated outside the solar system, poses no threat to Earth, as it will pass at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS marks only the third interstellar object recorded in Earth's vicinity. NASA's released images during a live event on November 19 have generated interest among astronomers and the public alike. Observers will need a telescope to see the comet, which will remain visible through spring 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will be approximately 170 million miles away at its closest approach.</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed the comet's interstellar origin in July 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first observed by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>The object has been traveling at about 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>It came within 19 million miles of Mars in early October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California has cataloged 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers confirmed Comet 3I/ATLAS originated from outside the solar system. It was first observed by ATLAS, an initiative funded by NASA. The comet approached Mars, coming within 19 million miles in early October, and passed near the sun on October 30, 2025. Observations resumed on October 31 after the comet moved out from behind the sun.</p>

<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA released new images of the comet during a live event, sparking further interest in its trajectory and visibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It's natural to wonder what it is. We love that the world wondered along with us,” said Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, during a news briefing in Greenbelt, Maryland. “We were quick to be able to say, 'Yup, it definitely behaves like a comet. We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is not the first interstellar object to capture public attention. Previous objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have also sparked debates regarding their origins and characteristics. The interest in these celestial bodies has led to various theories, some more speculative than scientific, about their nature and potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to observe the comet's trajectory and behavior. It will be visible from various dark sky locations in Ohio, including Geauga Observatory Park and Fry Family Park, allowing enthusiasts to catch a glimpse through telescopes.</p>
