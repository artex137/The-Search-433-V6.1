      <h2>'Ice Volcanoes' Are Erupting All Over 3I/ATLAS, as Scientists Say the Alien Visitor “May be a Primitive Carbonaceous Object”</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of active eruptions from “ice volcanoes” on its surface, according to new analysis released by researchers. The study, published on the arXiv preprint server, indicates significant changes in the comet's behavior as it approached the Sun, which could enhance understanding of comet formation and the chemistry of distant planetary systems.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it challenges current models of comet formation, suggesting that 3I/ATLAS may possess a unique structure and composition. Scientists are now tracking the comet closely to gather more data on its unusual activities and what they reveal about interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 2.5 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Research published on November 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Study led by Josep M. Trigo-Rodríguez, Maria Gritsevich, and Jürgen Blum.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object exhibiting cometary behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023. Observations since then have revealed the comet's unusual behavior, including increased brightness as it approached the Sun. Researchers have noted that this brightness surge indicates possible cryovolcanic activity on the comet’s surface.</p>

<p>On November 24, 2025, a study detailing these findings was published, highlighting the comet's potential composition and its implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The spectral similarities indicate that 3I/ATLAS may be a primitive carbonaceous object,” the researchers write in their paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is a potentially significant finding, as the study suggests that the metal-rich interior of 3I/ATLAS may be directly related to its activity,” the authors state.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects that have garnered attention from astronomers. Previous studies have focused on the characteristics of these objects, but 3I/ATLAS stands out due to its active cryovolcanism and metal-rich composition, which differ from typical comets found in our solar system.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS may reshape current understanding of how comets form and behave, especially those originating from distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its composition and activity. Future observations are expected to provide further insights into the nature of interstellar comets and their role in the formation of planetary systems.</p>
