      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS is monitored in real time as it definitively leaves the solar system</h2>

<p>NASA's Gemini North Observatory in Hawaii has conducted real-time observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is now definitively moving away from the solar system. The observation session took place on November 25, 2025, at 4 am local time (HST) and was broadcast live globally by the Shadow the Scientists project.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides scientists with immediate data on the comet's characteristics and behavior as it travels through the solar system. The data collected will aid researchers in understanding the comet's chemical composition and its origins, which are believed to be billions of years old.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Observation date: November 25, 2025</li>
  <li>Location: Gemini North Observatory, Maunakea, Hawaii</li>
  <li>Time of observation: 4 am HST</li>
  <li>Comet speed: 58 km/s</li>
  <li>Age estimate: between 3 billion and 14 billion years</li>
  <li>Dominant emissions: cyanogen and carbon dioxide</li>
  <li>Previous perihelion passage: October 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 25, 2025, scientists at the Gemini North Observatory began their observations of 3I/ATLAS after calibrating their 8.1-meter telescope instruments. They captured images and spectra of the comet as it reappeared in the Hawaiian sky following its passage behind the Sun. The session included the use of advanced techniques to gather three-dimensional data on the comet's emissions.</p>

<p>Prior observations made at Gemini South in Chile indicated changes in the comet's characteristics since its closest approach to the Sun. The data collected during this session will be made available to the scientific community without any exclusivity period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “The broadcast allowed the public to follow each stage of data collection,” said a representative from the Shadow the Scientists project.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system. It exhibits typical comet behavior with a bright coma and gas jets but differs from solar system comets due to its high carbon dioxide content. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory confirms its interstellar origin, and it has been a subject of interest for astronomers studying primordial materials from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories on Earth will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS until early 2026, providing further insights into its composition and behavior as it moves through interstellar space.</p>
