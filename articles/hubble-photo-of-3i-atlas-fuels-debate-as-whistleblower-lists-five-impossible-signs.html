      <h2>Hubble Photo of 3I/ATLAS Fuels Debate as Whistleblower Lists Five 'Impossible' Signs</h2>

<p>A new image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS captured by the Hubble Space Telescope has sparked significant debate among astronomers and enthusiasts since its release. The striking photograph, unveiled by NASA, has prompted a self-identified whistleblower to highlight five peculiar characteristics of the comet that challenge existing scientific understanding.</p>

<p>This debate matters as it brings attention to the complexities of cometary behavior and the potential for new discoveries in astrophysics. Authorities, including NASA, have not yet responded to the claims made by the whistleblower, who has gained traction on social media platforms by asserting that the features observed in the photo are unlike any typical comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope captured the image, with the release date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>The whistleblower's claims include five unusual characteristics of the comet.</li>
    <li>NASA has not verified the whistleblower’s temperature claim of 10,200 K.</li>
    <li>The Hubble image has prompted an online debate among scientists and amateur astronomers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The controversy began with the release of the Hubble image of 3I/ATLAS. A user on X, identifying as 3I/ATLAS WHISTLE BLOWER, posted the photograph along with claims about its unusual properties. The user suggested that the comet exhibited characteristics such as a nearly perfect spherical shape, straight jets, concentric arcs, and unusual luminosity patterns.</p>

<p>Following the post, discussions erupted online, with both amateur stargazers and seasoned experts attempting to understand the features shown in the image. The whistleblower's claims have not been addressed officially by NASA, which only identified the object as comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This photo of 3I/ATLAS just ended the debate,” the whistleblower stated, urging followers to examine the image closely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Normal comets don’t do this. Ever...” the whistleblower added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, comets have been understood as irregularly shaped bodies composed of ice and dust. The typical behavior of comets involves uneven mass loss, leading to non-uniform shapes. The claims made by the whistleblower challenge these established notions and suggest a need for further investigation into the nature of comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>Previous observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown that while jets from comets can appear straight, their trajectories are often influenced by various factors, including solar radiation. The features claimed by the whistleblower, if verified, would represent a significant anomaly in the study of cometary science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the debate continues, the astronomical community is likely to conduct further analysis of the Hubble image. NASA has not announced any plans for follow-up studies to address the claims made by the whistleblower. The scientific community awaits more information on the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and the implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
