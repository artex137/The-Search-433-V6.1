      <h2>NASA intensifies surveillance of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after detection of an enigmatic radio signal</h2>

<p>NASA has intensified its monitoring of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after it was detected emitting a continuous radio signal. The comet, traveling at approximately 100,000 km/h, is the third confirmed visitor from outside our Solar System. Its trajectory will take it on a single pass before returning to deep space.</p>

<p>The detection of the radio signal has raised significant interest among scientists. NASA's Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária has convened a team of experts to coordinate global observation efforts. This rare phenomenon requires in-depth investigations to understand the comet's composition and dynamics, which could provide insights into planetary formation in other parts of the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025, using the ATLAS astronomical survey system in Chile.</li>
    <li>It has a core estimated to be between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA have confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not gravitationally bound to our Sun.</li>
    <li>Continuous monitoring is ongoing to track the comet's radio signal and variations in brightness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile first identified 3I/ATLAS. Subsequent observations using the Hubble Space Telescope confirmed its dimensions and composition. In August 2025, NASA convened experts to assess the comet and coordinate global observation efforts. The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa later detected the continuous radio signal, confirming the comet's active nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The emission of radio waves, although of natural origin, is a phenomenon that requires in-depth investigations,” said a spokesperson from NASA’s Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Our main objective is to coordinate a global observation campaign to collect as much data as possible during its brief passage through our system,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS is noted for its stability and continuous natural radio emission, raising new questions about the characteristics of interstellar bodies. This research could provide crucial insights into the diversity of planetary building blocks available in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring of 3I/ATLAS will continue intensively in the coming months. Astronomers around the world are tracking its brightness variations, while global radio telescopes remain alert for any changes in the radio signal.</p>
