      <h2>'Alien spaceship' 3I/ATLAS has 'two jets' unlike most comets and 'needs explaining'</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, may possess “two jets” that differentiate it from typical comets, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The object has intrigued experts since its detection earlier this year, leading to ongoing debate about its true nature.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it challenges conventional understanding of comets, prompting further investigation into the object. NASA maintains that 3I/ATLAS is simply a comet, but Loeb has proposed that it could potentially be an alien spacecraft. His claims have stirred discussions within the scientific community regarding the object’s characteristics and implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first sighted earlier this year.</li>
    <li>The object is travelling through the Solar System at approximately 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Loeb's claims are based on Hubble images taken on November 2 and November 30.</li>
    <li>Nasa has classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet.</li>
    <li>Findings related to the object are expected to be released on February 18 and 20, 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in early 2023. On July 21, 2025, a Hubble image captured the comet approaching the Sun, revealing a sunward anti-tail. Subsequent images taken on November 2 and November 30 indicated the presence of two jets.</p>
<p>In a recent blog post, Loeb suggested the jets might be "pulsing like a heartbeat". He indicated that the object could potentially release technological devices on Jupiter as it nears the planet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This phenomenon is not normal in familiar comets and needs to be explained,” said Loeb in his blog.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“As I often say: the foundation of science is the humility to learn, not the arrogance of expertise,” Loeb added, criticizing the scientific establishment's dismissal of alternative theories.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb has consistently argued that 3I/ATLAS may be more than just a comet, suggesting it could be an alien "mothership". His statements contrast with NASA's position, which has classified the object as a comet and has been cautious about speculative theories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into 3I/ATLAS will continue, with findings scheduled for release in February 2024. The scientific community will likely engage further in discussions about the object’s characteristics and its implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
