      <h2>Team of astronomers tracking interstellar object think it could be a 10,000,000,000-year-old time capsule</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers from the University of A Coruña has identified an interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, that they believe could be over 10 billion years old. The comet is currently moving through the Milky Way and has attracted significant attention from major telescopes. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it provides insights into the evolution of celestial objects from other stellar systems. The astronomers have been tracking the comet's trajectory and have determined it likely originated from the explosion of a primordial planet. The findings could enhance our understanding of the universe's history.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be over 10 billion years old.</li>
    <li>It is approximately 5 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently near Mars’ orbit, but it will not collide with Earth.</li>
    <li>The team is using large telescopes to track its progress.</li>
    <li>NASA has monitored other near-Earth objects, including asteroid 2024 ON.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The astronomers first observed 3I/ATLAS due to its unusually high excess velocity. They have since been reverse engineering its trajectory to uncover its origins. The comet is currently located on the other side of the sun, closer to the NASA Perseverance Rover on Mars.</p>

<p>Xabier Pérez Couto, the team leader, has stated that each observation of the comet provides valuable insights into the universe's past.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What makes 3I/ATLAS unique is that it allows us to study the evolution of objects originating from other stellar systems – something we had only theorized about until now,” said Xabier Pérez Couto.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Each observation is like opening a window into the Universe’s past,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects is becoming increasingly important as astronomers aim to understand the formation and evolution of the universe. Previous studies of comets and asteroids have highlighted their potential impact on Earth and other planets. NASA has been proactive in monitoring these objects to prevent potential threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The astronomers will continue to track 3I/ATLAS and analyze its data to learn more about its origins and the implications for our understanding of cosmic history.</p>
