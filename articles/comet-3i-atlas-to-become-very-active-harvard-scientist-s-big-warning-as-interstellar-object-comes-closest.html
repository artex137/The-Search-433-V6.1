      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS to Become Very Active as it Approaches the Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, prompting significant interest among scientists and astronomers. The comet, which is approximately the size of Manhattan, has begun to exhibit a tail, suggesting it may undergo dramatic changes as it approaches perihelion.</p>

<p>This event is important because it provides a unique opportunity for scientific observation and research. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has added 3I/ATLAS to its monitoring list, acknowledging the comet's potential for extensive study. Researchers are preparing to capture images and data as the comet makes its final journey out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion on October 29.</li>
    <li>It will come as close as 1.4 astronomical units (about 130 million miles or 210 million kilometers) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet was confirmed by NASA in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the largest, fastest-moving, and likely the oldest interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
    <li>Observatories on Earth and in space are preparing to observe the comet.</li>
    <li>NASA's HiRISE camera has taken images of 3I/ATLAS, but they have not yet been released.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was confirmed by NASA in July 2023. As it approaches the Sun, it has started to exhibit unusual behavior, including the formation of a tail. Scientists expect this activity to increase as it nears perihelion on October 29.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to October 29, astronomers have noted that the comet is expected to outgas at an accelerated rate, resulting in a larger and brighter appearance when it becomes visible again in early November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “While it poses no threat, comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and its high interest to the scientific community.” 
    — International Asteroid Warning Network
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It’s at least a thousand times more massive than the previous interstellar objects we’ve seen.” 
    — Avi Loeb, Harvard scientist
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed in our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov. The unique characteristics of this comet, including its size and speed, have led to speculation about its origins and potential implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the possibility of the comet being an alien craft, a claim that has sparked discussion and debate within the scientific community. His comments highlight the need for vigilance in monitoring the comet's behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. Data and images from NASA's HiRISE camera are expected to be released once the ongoing government shutdown concludes. Observatories worldwide are prepared for further observations and analysis as the comet departs our solar system.</p>
