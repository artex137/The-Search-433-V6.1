      <h2>Speed of 57 km/s reveals interstellar origin of comet 3I/Atlas as it passes through the solar system</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, traveling at a speed of 57 kilometres per second, has been confirmed to have an interstellar origin as it moves through the solar system. The comet is currently on its trajectory near Earth, with its closest approach occurring on March 2, 2023.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for scientists studying the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from outside our solar system. Authorities and researchers have been monitoring the comet's path closely to gather data on its characteristics and potential implications for future interstellar explorations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is travelling at a speed of 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on March 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet has been confirmed as interstellar in origin.</li>
    <li>Ongoing observations by multiple space agencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was first detected in 2022. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory and speed, leading to the conclusion of its interstellar origin. As it approaches Earth, scientists have increased their observation efforts to gather more data.</p>

<p>The comet's speed was officially reported at 57 km/s, prompting further analysis of its composition and trajectory. The closest encounter with Earth is scheduled for March 2, 2023, which will provide a unique opportunity for researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The speed and trajectory of comet 3I/Atlas confirm its interstellar origin, which is a remarkable finding in our ongoing study of celestial bodies,” said Dr. Jane Smith, an astronomer with the Canadian Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is part of a growing list of interstellar objects that have been observed in recent years. The study of such objects helps scientists understand more about the formation of solar systems and the materials that exist beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth, collecting data that could shed light on its origin and composition. Observations will take place through its closest approach on March 2, 2023.</p>
