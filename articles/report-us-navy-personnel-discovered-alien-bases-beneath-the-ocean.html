      <h2>Report: US Navy Personnel Discover Alien Bases Beneath the Ocean</h2>

<p>U.S. Navy personnel have reported a significant number of UFO sightings near “five or six” deep-water sites worldwide, according to Rep. Tim Burchett, a member of the House Oversight Committee. Burchett stated these sightings have raised questions about the existence of secret alien bases hidden beneath the ocean. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to these sightings.</p>

<p>Burchett’s comments highlight ongoing investigations into unidentified submerged objects (USOs). Authorities are examining these reports to determine the nature of the encounters and any potential implications for national security and scientific understanding.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reported sightings involve underwater crafts moving at speeds exceeding 640 km/h.</li>
    <li>Burchett has represented Knoxville, Tennessee, since 2019.</li>
    <li>Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins testified about a sighting on February 15, 2023, off the coast of Southern California.</li>
    <li>The incident involved four tic-tac-shaped objects that moved in unison.</li>
    <li>Wiggins used a thermal sensor to detect the objects; no U.S. aircraft were present in the area during the sighting.</li>
    <li>The sightings have been linked to Warning Area 291, a military-controlled zone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, on February 15, Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins observed four tic-tac-shaped objects while aboard the USS Jackson. The objects emerged from the ocean and moved northeast in unison. Wiggins reported the sighting to his superiors and used a thermal sensor for further analysis.</p>

<p>On September 9, 2023, Wiggins testified before a congressional hearing, sharing details of his experience and the unusual characteristics of the objects he observed. His testimony contributed to the growing body of evidence regarding USO sightings.</p>

<p>Rep. Tim Burchett has commented on the implications of these sightings, suggesting a need for further investigation into underwater alien bases.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have naval personnel telling me that we have sightings … of these underwater crafts that they’re chasing,” said Rep. Tim Burchett.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What I observed and what our crew recorded was not consistent with conventional aircraft or drones,” testified Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent UFO sightings build on a long history of similar reports dating back to Christopher Columbus’s voyage in 1492. Historically, sailors and pilots have reported mysterious crafts emerging from the ocean. The phenomenon has gained renewed attention in recent years, particularly with the establishment of government programs to investigate unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Dr. Bill Birnes, a New York Times bestselling author, has claimed that aliens have monitored Earth’s evolution from underwater bases for centuries. This perspective adds to the ongoing debate surrounding the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating the reports of USOs and the implications for national security. Further testimony from military personnel and analysis of flight data may contribute to a clearer understanding of these phenomena.</p>
