      <h2>Trump accuses Obama of sharing “classified” information on extraterrestrials</h2>

<p>US President Donald Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of disclosing “classified” information regarding extraterrestrial life during a podcast interview released last week. Obama stated he believed in the existence of aliens but had seen no evidence of contact during his presidency from 2009 to 2017. Trump made his comments to reporters on Thursday.</p>

<p>This exchange has sparked renewed interest in discussions surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the government's handling of information related to them. In light of these developments, authorities are expected to assess the implications of public statements on national security and classified information.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump's remarks were made on Thursday, following Obama's podcast interview.</li>
    <li>Obama's comments were made during an interview with Brian Tyler Cohen.</li>
    <li>Obama served as President from 2009 to 2017.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon released a report in March 2024 regarding UAPs.</li>
    <li>Many reported UAP sightings have been identified as weather balloons, spy planes, or satellites.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a podcast interview released last week, Barack Obama discussed the possibility of alien life, stating, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in… Area 51.” Following the viral spread of his comments, Obama clarified on Instagram that while he believed in the possibility of extraterrestrial life, he had seen no evidence of contact during his presidency.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Donald Trump responded to Obama's remarks, accusing him of sharing classified information and stating that he “made a big mistake.” Trump did not specify which part of Obama's comments he deemed classified.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He gave classified information, he is not supposed to be doing that. He made a big mistake.” - Donald Trump</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” - Barack Obama</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding UAPs has gained momentum in recent years, particularly as the US government has investigated numerous reports of unexplained aerial objects. This has raised concerns about potential foreign powers testing advanced technologies. The Pentagon's March 2024 report indicated no evidence that UAPs represented alien technology.</p>

<p>The public's fascination with extraterrestrial life continues to grow, while government agencies remain cautious about the implications of sharing classified information.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities may review the implications of the statements made by both Trump and Obama regarding classified information as interest in UAPs persists. Further investigations into UAP sightings and government transparency on the subject are anticipated.</p>
