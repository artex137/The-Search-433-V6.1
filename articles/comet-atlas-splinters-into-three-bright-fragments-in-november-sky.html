      <h2>Comet ATLAS Splinters Into Three Bright Fragments in November Sky</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has split into three luminous fragments, creating a notable astronomical event observed throughout November 2025 by astronomers in Europe and the United States. No injuries or fatalities have been reported as a result of this celestial occurrence.</p>

<p>The breakup of Comet ATLAS provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study a comet disintegrating as it travels through the inner solar system. Observatories have captured real-time footage of this event, which may offer valuable insights into the composition and behavior of primordial comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet ATLAS was discovered in May 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.</li>
    <li>The comet began to brighten rapidly as it approached perihelion on 8 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Italian astronomers at the Asiago Observatory captured images of the breakup on 11 November 2025.</li>
    <li>The fragments were tracked between 11 and 18 November 2025.</li>
    <li>The two brightest fragments are approximately 2,000 km apart, with a smaller fragment nearby.</li>
    <li>Observers in the Northern Hemisphere can view the fragments in the constellation Ursa Major.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 8 October 2025, Comet ATLAS reached perihelion, which appears to have destabilized its nucleus. By 11 November, astronomers at the Asiago Observatory captured images of the comet breaking apart. Observations from the Virtual Telescope Project showed the comet's nucleus splintering into three distinct fragments between 11 and 18 November.</p>

<p>As of late November 2025, astronomers continue to track the fragments as they drift and dissipate in the night sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The fragmentation offers highly significant clues about how these ancient bodies evolve and how they ultimately disintegrate,” said Dr. Elena Mazzotta Epifani of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The breakup of comets is a rare but valuable event for astronomers. Such comets, like C/2025 K1, are considered pristine and may hold clues about the early solar system. The study of their fragmentation can reveal important information about their internal structure and the forces acting upon them as they approach the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor the fragments of Comet ATLAS as they evolve and disperse. Ongoing observations may yield further insights into the origins of our solar system and the life cycle of comets.</p>
