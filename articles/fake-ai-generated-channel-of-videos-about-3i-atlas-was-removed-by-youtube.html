      <h2>Fake AI-Generated Channel of Videos About 3I/ATLAS Removed by YouTube</h2>

<p>YouTube has removed a fake AI-generated channel that featured misleading videos about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, following a request from Avi Loeb on December 8, 2025. The channel was reportedly created to exploit Loeb's popularity and misinform viewers, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this incident.</p>

<p>The removal of the channel is significant as it highlights the issue of misinformation in digital media. Avi Loeb, a prominent astrophysicist, has expressed concern over the spread of false content, which he claims undermines public understanding of scientific facts. Following communication with YouTube representatives, Loeb has sought to hold the creators of the fake videos accountable for defamation and false content.</p>

<p>Later that same day, YouTube removed the channel in response to Loeb's claims and evidence of misinformation.</p>
