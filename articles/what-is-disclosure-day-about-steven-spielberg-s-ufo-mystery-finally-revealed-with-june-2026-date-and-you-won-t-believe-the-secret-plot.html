      <h2>Steven Spielberg's UFO thriller 'Disclosure Day' set for June 2026</h2>
<p>Steven Spielberg has unveiled the first teaser for his upcoming UFO thriller, titled <strong>Disclosure Day</strong>, which will be released in theaters on <strong>June 12, 2026</strong>. The film features an all-star cast, including <strong>Emily Blunt</strong>, <strong>Josh O’Connor</strong>, <strong>Colin Firth</strong>, <strong>Colman Domingo</strong>, <strong>Eve Hewson</strong>, and <strong>Wyatt Russell</strong>. The film marks Spielberg's return to the alien invasion genre after a hiatus since 2022.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>The film explores humanity's response to the discovery of extraterrestrial life. Authorities in the film industry anticipate that <strong>Disclosure Day</strong> will resonate with audiences, especially in light of increased interest in UFOs and government transparency regarding alien existence. The film's themes reflect a growing cultural fascination with such topics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Title: Disclosure Day</li>
    <li>Release date: June 12, 2026</li>
    <li>Director: Steven Spielberg</li>
    <li>Screenwriter: David Koepp</li>

    <li>Teaser trailer released: December 16, 2025</li>
    <li>Marketing campaign featured cryptic billboards in Times Square and Los Angeles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>For months, Spielberg has kept details about the project under wraps, with only cryptic billboards appearing in major cities. On <strong>December 16, 2025</strong>, Universal Pictures released the official teaser, confirming the film's focus on extraterrestrial life and government cover-ups.</p>
<p>The teaser hints at significant themes, including humanity's right to know the truth about our existence in the universe. The film draws inspiration from Spielberg's previous works, such as <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> and <em>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial</em>.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I finished reading the script and I bawled,” said Colman Domingo, one of the film's actors. “I thought it was one of the most beautiful scripts about our humanity.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Josh O’Connor commented, “It’s like old-school Spielberg. I think people will be excited.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Disclosure Day positions itself as a spiritual successor to Spielberg's significant works in the sci-fi genre. The film aims to blend elements of wonder, emotional connections, and apocalyptic horror, reflecting recent cultural trends around UFOs and government transparency. The documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, which highlights alleged government cover-ups regarding alien existence, has also captured public interest, recently becoming the most-rented documentary on Amazon Prime in its first 48 hours.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the film approaches its release date, further marketing and promotional efforts are expected. Investigations into the themes of government transparency and extraterrestrial life will likely continue to be a focus in public discourse leading up to the film's premiere.</p>
