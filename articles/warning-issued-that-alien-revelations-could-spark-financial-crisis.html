      <h2>Warning Issued That Alien Revelations Could Spark Financial Crisis</h2>

<p>A former policy expert at the Bank of England has warned that a confirmation of alien life could trigger a financial crisis. Helen McCaw, who served as a senior analyst in financial security until 2012, addressed her concerns in an interview with The Times of London, stating that politicians and bankers need to take the possibility seriously. She has urged the governor of the Bank of England to prepare a contingency plan in the event of such an announcement.</p>

<p>This warning is significant as a 2021 study from the Pew Research Center found that nearly two-thirds of Americans believe in the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth. McCaw's comments highlight the potential economic ramifications of disclosing information about extraterrestrial life, including price volatility and a collapse in market confidence. She expressed concern that authorities may not be adequately prepared for the psychological and material consequences of such a revelation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Helen McCaw has previously worked at the Bank of England for ten years.</li>
    <li>A 2021 Pew Research Center study indicated that about two-thirds of Americans believe in intelligent extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>The UFO documentary The Age of Disclosure was released in 2025, creating significant public interest.</li>
    <li>President Donald Trump has suggested the possibility of declassifying information on extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>McCaw warned of potential unrest and a rush to safe assets like gold following a UAP disclosure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2021, the Pew Research Center released a study indicating that nearly two-thirds of Americans believe in extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2025, the documentary The Age of Disclosure gained attention, with its director suggesting that President Trump might reveal the existence of aliens. Following these developments, McCaw's warning emerged in late 2023 as she urged the Bank of England to prepare for possible financial turmoil linked to alien revelations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The United States government appears to be partway through a multiyear process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs),” McCaw told The Times.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions,” she added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding extraterrestrial life and its implications has gained traction in recent years, particularly following various documentaries and public statements by political figures. The growing interest in UAPs reflects a shift in societal attitudes toward the possibility of intelligent life beyond Earth, positioning it as a significant topic of discourse.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to monitor developments related to UAP disclosures closely. The public's interest in extraterrestrial life continues to grow, with upcoming projects like the film Disclosure Day, set for release in the U.S. on June 12, 2026, likely to keep the conversation active.</p>
