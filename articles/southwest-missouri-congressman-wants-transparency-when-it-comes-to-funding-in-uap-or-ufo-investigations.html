      <h2>Southwest Missouri congressman wants transparency when it comes to funding in UAP or UFO investigations</h2>

<p>Southwest Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison has introduced new legislation focusing on the investigation of UFOs, or Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), in the United States. The legislation comes amid reports of 2,911 unusual sightings in Missouri, as revealed by the National UFO Reporting Center. This week, the Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing titled “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection.”</p>

<p>This legislation is significant as it aims to amend the National Defense Authorization Act to ensure government records related to UAPs are preserved. According to the 2025 budget, the United States will allocate approximately $850 billion for national defense. Congressman Burlison emphasizes the need for oversight in the funding allocated for UAP investigations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>2,911 reports of UAPs in Missouri, according to the National UFO Reporting Center</li>
    <li>2025 budget allocates approximately $850 billion for national defense</li>
    <li>Hearing titled “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection” held this week</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Congressman Eric Burlison introduced his UAP Disclosure Act of 2025 to ensure transparency regarding UAP investigations. The Oversight Subcommittee conducted a hearing this week to discuss UAP transparency and whistleblower protections. The proposed act aims to create a UAP Records Collection at the National Archives and establish an independent review board.</p>

<p>According to Rep. Burlison, the legislation would require disclosure of UAP records within 25 years, unless a national security concern is addressed by the president. He expressed his skepticism about the existence of extraterrestrial life but acknowledged the public's interest in the topic.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For me, this is not a topic that was like a pet project of mine; being on the committee, it is a fascinating topic, I won’t lie,” said Congressman Burlison. “I remain a skeptic; I don’t believe there are little green men flying here from other solar systems or whatever.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“What has been shown and proven is that we are spending a lot of money on this topic, and there is no oversight,” Burlison added. “I think if I am going to do my job right, I am going to do it like I do everything else, do it diligently and try to get to the bottom of things.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Recent discussions around UAPs have gained traction, with increasing public interest and reports of sightings. The proposed legislation seeks to address concerns over the lack of oversight regarding the funding of investigations into UAPs, a topic that has intrigued both lawmakers and the public alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Oversight Subcommittee will continue to address UAP transparency and the implications of the proposed legislation. Congressman Burlison aims to ensure that the funding for UAP investigations is scrutinized and that records are preserved for future review.</p>
