      <h2>Are aliens real? See how many UFO reports have come out of Illinois</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has jokingly confirmed the existence of aliens during a podcast interview with Brian Tyler Cohen on February 14, 2026. The conversation has sparked interest in UFO sightings in Illinois, where a total of 4,498 reports have been recorded since 1995.</p>

<p>This discussion has raised questions about the legitimacy of UFO sightings and the broader implications of extraterrestrial life. Authorities and organizations like the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) continue to collect and analyze these reports to better understand the phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> February 14, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Illinois</li>
    <li><strong>Total UFO reports in Illinois:</strong> 4,498 since 1995</li>
    <li><strong>NUFORC founded:</strong> 1974</li>
    <li><strong>Most reported states:</strong> California (17,061), Florida (8,831), Washington (7,585)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2026, Obama participated in a lightning round of questions during a podcast with Cohen. When asked about the existence of aliens, he humorously confirmed their potential existence but noted he had not seen them himself. He further stated that he had seen no evidence of extraterrestrial contact during his presidency.</p>

<p>The following day, Obama clarified his statements on Instagram, emphasizing the vastness of the universe and the low probability of alien visitation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them. They’re not being kept at Area 51.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The term "unidentified flying object" (UFO) was coined by the U.S. Air Force in 1952 to describe aerial phenomena that could not be immediately identified. The National UFO Reporting Center has documented over 180,000 reports of unusual events since its inception.</p>

<p>Illinois ranks ninth among U.S. states for UFO sightings, with a significant number of reports contributing to ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and organizations like NUFORC will continue to investigate UFO reports, seeking to provide clarity and understanding regarding these unexplained occurrences.</p>
