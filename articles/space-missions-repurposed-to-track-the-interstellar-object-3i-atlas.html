      <h2>Space missions repurposed to track the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Space agencies have mobilized their Mars and Jupiter exploration probes to track the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it passes through our Solar System. First detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile, this comet presents a unique opportunity to study material from another star system.</p>

<p>The comet, distinguished by its extrasolar origin and confirmed hyperbolic trajectory, travels at an impressive speed of 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h). Ground-based observations were possible until September 2025, but its approach to the Sun made these increasingly difficult, prompting space agencies to utilize ongoing missions for continued study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected by ATLAS telescope system in Chile in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet reached a minimum distance of 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) from Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Psyche mission contributed to data collection during the passage.</li>
    <li>ESA's JUICE mission will observe the comet between November 2 and 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile. Observations from Earth continued until September 2025, when its proximity to the Sun hindered further ground-based viewing. From October 1 to 7, 2025, the ESA and NASA Mars missions, including Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, monitored the comet's approach, with a closest distance to Mars recorded on October 3.</p>

<p>The ESA's JUICE mission will take over observations from November 2 to 25, 2025, coinciding with the comet's perihelion, the point at which it is closest to the Sun. This period is critical as the comet's ices will vaporize, allowing for detailed chemical analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These coordinated observations from space allow us to bypass the limitations of ground-based telescopes and study the comet during its most active phase,” a spokesperson from the European Space Agency said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS are rare, as they travel freely through interstellar space and typically exhibit hyperbolic trajectories. Their study provides insights into the formation conditions of planetary systems beyond our own. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have also sparked significant interest in understanding cosmic diversity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data collected from these space missions will provide the most detailed information ever obtained about an interstellar object, enhancing our understanding of the formation processes of planetary systems in the galaxy.</p>
