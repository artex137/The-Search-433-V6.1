      <h2>Our Interstellar Visitor, 3I/ATLAS, Could Be As Old As Our Galaxy</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor, is currently passing through our solar system and is believed to have originated from a star cluster approximately 8 billion years old. This discovery has significant implications for scientists studying the formation of the Milky Way galaxy. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 30, 2023.</p>

<p>This comet provides a unique opportunity to gather insights about the early universe, specifically during a period known as "cosmic noon," when about half of all stars formed. According to Universe Today, researchers have traced the comet's trajectory back to the galactic thick disk, which contains 85% of the galaxy's stars, including the oldest ones. Scientists are eager to study 3I/ATLAS to understand more about its composition and the history of our galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> 8 billion-year-old star cluster</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun at perihelion:</strong> not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Notable discoveries:</strong> High levels of carbon dioxide and signs of nickel and iron in the coma</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has traveled across the galaxy and is now on a trajectory that brings it between Earth and Mars. Scientists have been studying its properties since its detection, which is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects since the first was identified in 2017. The comet will reach perihelion on October 30, 2023, providing a significant moment for observation, even though Earth will be on the opposite side of the Sun at that time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS could be one of the oldest objects in the galaxy,” said astrochemist Martin Cordiner.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever detected in our solar system. The discovery of such objects has increased since 2017, highlighting the advancements in astronomical technology and observation methods. New telescopes, such as the Rubin Observatory, are expected to enhance our ability to spot and study these cosmic visitors further.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it transits through our solar system. The focus will remain on understanding its unique composition and the implications for our knowledge of the Milky Way's formation. Future observations from advanced telescopes may aid in answering questions left by this comet.</p>
