      <h2>3I/ATLAS Changes Colour Again—NASA Baffled by Strange Shift</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed a second colour change in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it accelerates in a manner that gravity alone cannot explain. The unusual observations have left NASA and other space agencies puzzled as they seek to understand the comet's behaviour.</p>

<p>The latest findings are significant as they may provide insights into the comet's origins and composition. Observations have shown that 3I/ATLAS has brightened considerably and exhibits unexpected characteristics, prompting further investigation from astronomers worldwide.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2023 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
  <li>The comet has changed colour twice, with the latest observations made as it neared perihelion on 29 October 2023.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS brightened to around magnitude 9, making it visible with small telescopes.</li>
  <li>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported signs of non-gravitational acceleration.</li>
  <li>The comet is currently on an escape trajectory from the solar system.</li>
  <li>Observations were conducted using the STEREO, SOHO, and GOES-19 satellites.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2023. Since then, astronomers have monitored its trajectory and behaviour closely. As the comet approached perihelion on 29 October 2023, it exhibited a significant brightening and a colour change, prompting renewed interest from the scientific community.</p>

<p>The comet's path took it behind the Sun, creating an observational blackout. During this time, theories about its nature, including speculation about an alien spacecraft, emerged but have been largely dismissed by astronomers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The non-gravitational acceleration was measured at the perihelion distance of 1.36 times the Earth-Sun separation,” said Davide Farnoccia, a navigation engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Our cursory analysis of this data indicates the comet will likely emerge from conjunction considerably brighter than when it entered,” the solar observatory team stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, joining 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique characteristics have sparked interest in understanding more about the environments from which interstellar comets originate. The comet's unusual behaviour has led to various hypotheses, although a natural explanation remains the most widely accepted among scientists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will monitor its behaviour closely. Further observations in November and December 2023 may help clarify the reasons behind its rapid brightening and unusual acceleration. The scientific community anticipates that these studies will provide more definitive insights into the comet's nature and origins.</p>
