      <h2>Trump has prepared speech on extraterrestrial life, Lara Trump says</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump is holding a speech regarding extraterrestrial life and spaceships, according to his daughter-in-law Lara Trump. She revealed this information during an appearance on the Pod Force One podcast, noting that the former president is waiting for the opportune moment to deliver the address.</p>

<p>This development has attracted attention amid ongoing discussions about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). Authorities, including lawmakers, have engaged in hearings and briefings related to these topics, highlighting growing public interest in potential government disclosures about extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Speaker: Former President Donald Trump</li>
    <li>Source of claim: Lara Trump, on Pod Force One podcast</li>
    <li>White House response: Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt commented on the claim</li>
    <li>Former President Barack Obama made recent statements about extraterrestrial life</li>
    <li>House hearings on UAP have been ongoing</li>
    <li>Testimony from whistleblower David Grusch in July 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, interest in UFOs and UAP has surged. In July 2023, a House hearing featured testimony from David Grusch, a former military intelligence officer, who claimed that the Pentagon is withholding information about UAP. He alleged that the government has been engaged in efforts to reverse engineer nonhuman technology retrieved from crash sites.</p>

<p>In response to inquiries about Lara Trump's comments, White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt stated that a speech on aliens would be of great interest, but it was news to her. This comment came amid a broader conversation about the public's fascination with extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Former President Obama also entered the conversation, clarifying his previous remarks about aliens during a podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen. He stated that while the universe is vast, he has seen no evidence of extraterrestrial life during his presidency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We’ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this… we all want to know about the UFOs… and he played a little coy with us,” Lara Trump said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I’ll have to check in with our speech writing team. Uh, and that would be of great interest to me personally, and I’m sure all of you in this room and apparently former President Obama, too,” said White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” Obama said, adding, “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UFOs has gained traction in recent years, particularly following the U.S. government's rebranding of UFOs as UAP. Lawmakers have been holding hearings to investigate these phenomena. Testimonies from former military personnel have suggested that there may be undisclosed information about UAP, leading to heightened scrutiny of government practices regarding extraterrestrial matters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP and related claims are expected to continue, with further hearings likely as lawmakers seek more transparency from the Pentagon and other agencies regarding extraterrestrial phenomena.</p>
