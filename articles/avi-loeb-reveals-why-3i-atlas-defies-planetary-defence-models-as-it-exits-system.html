      <h2>Avi Loeb Reveals: Why 3I/ATLAS Defies Planetary Defence Models as it Exits System</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar comet, has passed Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometres on December 19, 2025. The comet, which travels at 58 kilometres per second, has exhibited unusual behaviour that challenges existing planetary defence models, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises concerns about how potential threats from space are tracked. With asteroid 99942 Apophis set to approach Earth in 2029, experts emphasize the importance of adapting current models to account for the unexpected characteristics of comets like 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) detected the comet from May 7 to June 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS displayed a mass loss rate of about 5 grams per second, with emissions of nickel detected on July 20, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres wide.</li>
    <li>Brightness post-perihelion equates to sunlight reflecting off a 10-kilometre-wide sphere.</li>
    <li>NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office states that Apophis poses no crash risk in 2029.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 7, 2025, TESS began observing 3I/ATLAS. The comet was officially detected by the ATLAS survey in Chile on July 1, 2025. Subsequent observations revealed its unusual brightness and non-gravitational accelerations.</p>
<p>On July 20, 2025, emissions of nickel were first detected from the comet. It made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and is expected to exit the solar system by March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"These interstellar guests represent a new class of objects that still need to be figured out," said Harvard's Professor Avi Loeb.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Misread these oddities, and a real danger slips through the net," Loeb added, stressing the urgency of adapting planetary defence models.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS highlight the need for updated models in planetary defence. Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have already prompted discussions about the limitations of current tracking methods. The upcoming approach of asteroid Apophis only adds to the urgency of refining these models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community is calling for greater transparency regarding data from space agencies. Upcoming observations from the James Webb Space Telescope are scheduled for December 2025, which will aid in further understanding 3I/ATLAS and its implications for planetary defence.</p>
