      <h2>The ‘ET of Varginha’ captivates Brazil 30 years after sighting dismissed by a military investigation</h2>

<p>On January 20, 1996, three Brazilian teenagers reported seeing a strange creature in a vacant lot in Varginha, Minas Gerais. The girls described the being as having a heart-shaped face, large red eyes, three small horns on its forehead, and a shiny, brownish body. Liliane Silva, one of the witnesses, recalled, “It had arms and legs, like a human being, but also horns, three horns.” This sighting has been a topic of fascination in Brazil for three decades.</p>

<p>The Varginha incident is significant as it continues to draw attention from ufologists and the public. The city is celebrating the 30th anniversary of the sighting with an international UFO conference. On the eve of the event, the Superior Military Court released its official investigation, which concluded that the story was fabricated. Despite this, new testimonies and documentaries are keeping the legend alive.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: January 20, 1996</li>
    <li>Location: Varginha, Minas Gerais, Brazil</li>
    <li>Population of Varginha: 135,000</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 20, 1996, three teenagers claim to have seen an extraterrestrial being in Varginha. Following the sighting, lawyer and ufologist Ubirajara Rodrigues interviews the witnesses and supports their claims. The incident gains media attention, prompting various military investigations.</p>

<p>In the months following the sighting, anonymous military testimonies emerge, suggesting the alien was captured and taken to a hospital and military barracks. Despite these claims, the official military investigation, comprising two volumes and 600 pages, concludes that there is no evidence supporting the existence of the creature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The military personnel cited by the press did not participate in any operation transporting any type of cargo. The media are mistaken, publicizing untrue events,” the military investigation concludes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Without a doubt, it wasn’t him,” Valquiria Silva, another witness, states regarding the military's theory that the creature was a local resident with mental disabilities.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Varginha incident is one of the most notable cases in Brazilian ufology. It has been preserved in the National Archives, alongside numerous other UFO sightings investigated by the Brazilian Armed Forces. The incident's longevity in public memory is unlike many other alleged extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<p>Over the years, Varginha has embraced its association with the extraterrestrial, turning it into a tourist attraction. Statues, an ET Memorial, and themed souvenirs contribute to the local economy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The international UFO conference will take place in Varginha next weekend, drawing interest from ufologists and enthusiasts alike. The city continues to promote its extraterrestrial narrative, despite the military's dismissal of the claims.</p>
