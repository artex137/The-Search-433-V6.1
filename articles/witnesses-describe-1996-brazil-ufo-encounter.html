      <h2>Witnesses describe 1996 Brazil UFO encounter</h2>

<p>Investigative filmmaker James Fox held a news conference on Tuesday to discuss unidentified anomalous phenomena, where witnesses recounted a UFO crash in Varginha, Brazil, that occurred in January 1996. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the crash, but witnesses described encounters with nonhuman entities following the incident.</p>

<p>This news conference is significant as it has brought renewed attention to the Varginha incident, with multiple witnesses sharing their experiences of the events surrounding the crash. Authorities have not disclosed any current investigations, but Fox has stated he is working to gather more testimonies and evidence related to the incident.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> January 1996</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Varginha, Brazil</li>
    <li><strong>Witnesses:</strong> Multiple, including three young women and a medical examiner</li>
    <li><strong>Entities reported:</strong> Nonhuman biological entities, some dead, one possibly living</li>
    <li><strong>Associated military presence:</strong> Army vehicles arrived shortly after the crash</li>
    <li><strong>Medical examiner findings:</strong> Soldier died from a highly virulent bacterium</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In January 1996, witnesses reported seeing a cigar-shaped object crash into a field in Varginha. The first witness, Carlos, followed the craft to the crash site, where he observed debris and a strong smell. Shortly thereafter, military personnel arrived and ordered him to leave the area.</p>

<p>Three young women, including Liliane Silva and Katia Xavier, encountered a creature they described as having red eyes and oily skin. They reported feeling fear and a sense of urgency to escape. A medical examiner later noted the unusual death of a soldier, linking it to the events surrounding the crash.</p>

<p>Fox's team attempted to gather testimonies from additional witnesses, but their visas were denied. They returned to Brazil to record statements from those who could not attend the conference.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I faced 30 years of ridicule and judgment; I hope people will take my experience seriously,” said Carlos, a witness to the crash.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I felt like the world was being stopped when I looked at it,” said Liliane Silva, describing her encounter with the entity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The bacterium is found on Earth but does not commonly infect humans,” stated the medical examiner regarding the soldier's cause of death.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Varginha incident has been a topic of interest for decades, with many considering it one of the most significant UFO encounters in Brazil. Previous reports have indicated military involvement and attempts to suppress information regarding the events that transpired.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in UFO phenomena, with many individuals coming forward to share their experiences and seek transparency from government authorities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Fox and his team continue to pursue additional testimonies and evidence related to the Varginha incident. Investigations into the medical findings and eyewitness accounts are ongoing, with hopes for further clarity regarding the events of January 1996.</p>
