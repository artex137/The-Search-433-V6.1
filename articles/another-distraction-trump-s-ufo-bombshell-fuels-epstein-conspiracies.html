      <h2>Trump directs release of UFO files amid Epstein scrutiny</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump has directed his administration to release more government files related to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), according to a post on Truth Social on Thursday. His announcement comes as demands grow from both Democrats and Republicans for the full release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking case.</p>

<p>Trump's directive has raised questions about whether he is attempting to distract the public from the Epstein files, in which he is reportedly mentioned over one million times.
