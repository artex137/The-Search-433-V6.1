      <h2>3I/ATLAS, comet hurtling toward solar system, much bigger than previously thought, astronomers say</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is on a trajectory toward the inner solar system and is likely much larger than previously estimated, according to astronomers. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb stated in a blog post on Thursday that the comet likely weighs over <strong>33 billion tons</strong>.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it underscores the comet's size and composition, which may provide insights into interstellar objects. The comet has been observed using data from the Webb Space Telescope, which was collected on August 6. Authorities from NASA and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) are closely monitoring its path.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS likely weighs more than <strong>33 billion tons</strong>.</li>
    <li>Its nucleus is likely over <strong>3.1 miles</strong> in diameter.</li>
    <li>Comet is primarily composed of carbon dioxide and water ice.</li>
    <li>First detected in July 2023 by ATLAS in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Will come within <strong>1.67 million miles</strong> of Mars' orbit on October 3.</li>
    <li>Expected to reappear in early December 2023 after passing close to the sun.</li>
    <li>Third recorded interstellar object entering the inner solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet was first detected in July 2023 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile. On August 6, data collected by the Webb Space Telescope provided new insights into its mass and composition. On October 3, 3I/ATLAS will come close to Mars' orbit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The diameter of the nucleus of the comet is likely more than 3.1 miles, the largest of two other interstellar objects previously recorded."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nasa officials confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth and noted its unusual trajectory will bring it close to Jupiter, Mars, and Venus.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object recorded entering the inner solar system. The first was "Oumuamua," detected in 2017, and the second was "21/Borisov," identified in 2019. These discoveries have sparked interest in understanding the origins and compositions of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the inner solar system. The comet is expected to become unobservable after September due to its proximity to the sun, but it will reappear in early December.</p>
