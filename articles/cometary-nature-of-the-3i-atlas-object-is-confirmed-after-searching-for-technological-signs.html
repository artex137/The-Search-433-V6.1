      <h2>Cometary nature of the 3I/ATLAS object is confirmed after searching for technological signs</h2>

<p>An international team has confirmed the cometary nature of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS after conducting a search for artificial signals. The analysis took place in December 2025, during the object’s closest approach to Earth, approximately 167 million kilometers away. The study ruled out the presence of artificial radio emissions, reinforcing its classification as a natural comet.</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it aligns with the current understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics. Authorities from the Breakthrough Listen project, which conducted the search, have stated that the findings provide crucial insights into the composition and behavior of such celestial bodies. The investigation utilized the Green Bank Telescope, one of the world’s most powerful radio telescopes, to monitor 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025</li>
  <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
  <li>Distance during closest approach: approximately 167 million kilometers</li>
  <li>Speed: greater than 30 kilometers per second relative to the Sun</li>
  <li>Observatories involved: Green Bank Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, and others</li>
  <li>Analysis conducted by: Breakthrough Listen project</li>
  <li>Observation date: December 18, 2025</li>
  <li>Frequency range scanned: 1 to 12 GHz</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and was identified as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic trajectory and high speed. On October 2025, it reached its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun. The object made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, providing a rare opportunity for observation.</p>
<p>Prior to this closest approach, the Breakthrough Listen project directed the Green Bank Telescope towards 3I/ATLAS on December 18, 2025, in an effort to detect any signs of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “The absence of localized artificial emissions provides strong evidence against the hypothesis of a technological origin, aligning with all other observations pointing to a natural celestial body,” said a representative from the Breakthrough Listen project.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/‘Oumuamua, detected in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, identified in 2019. Unlike ‘Oumuamua, which exhibited a peculiar shape and no visible coma, 2I/Borisov displayed classic comet characteristics. This diversity among interstellar objects suggests that various celestial bodies can originate from different planetary systems across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The findings regarding 3I/ATLAS will continue to inform scientists' understanding of interstellar objects. Further studies may focus on the object’s composition and behavior as it travels through interstellar space.</p>
