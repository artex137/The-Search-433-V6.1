      <h2>The third visitor from outside the Solar System arrives at high speed; interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is one of the biggest mysteries of the year</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, designated 3I/Atlas, has entered the Solar System, traveling at a remarkable speed of 57 kilometres per second. The comet is currently passing through our cosmic neighborhood, drawing attention from major observatories worldwide.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System. It challenges existing assumptions about the frequency of such visitors and poses intriguing questions about its origin and composition. Astronomers are actively monitoring 3I/Atlas to gather data and refine their understanding of this unique celestial body.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas travels at 57 km/s, making it the fastest interstellar object detected.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory is hyperbolic, indicating it is not bound to the Solar System.</li>
    <li>A network of international telescopes is monitoring 3I/Atlas since its discovery.</li>
    <li>Astronomers are analyzing its composition using spectroscopy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been detected as it approaches the inner Solar System. Its trajectory and speed have been calculated through observations made by a global network of telescopes. These measurements confirm that the comet originated from outside our Solar System.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar objects, 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, were noted for their speeds of 26 km/s and 33 km/s, respectively. The significantly higher speed of 3I/Atlas suggests a violent expulsion from its original star system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The speed of 3I/Atlas is a direct indication of its violent origin. It likely was ejected from its system due to extreme gravitational interactions,” said an astronomer involved in the monitoring efforts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This comet serves as a time capsule, providing insights into the building blocks of life and the conditions in distant star systems,” the astronomer added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the arrival of 3I/Atlas, only two interstellar objects had been identified, highlighting the rarity of such events. The increasing frequency of detected interstellar comets suggests that they may be more common than previously thought.</p>

<p>The study of these comets is crucial for understanding the distribution of life’s building blocks across the galaxy. The composition of interstellar objects can provide clues about the formation of planets and the potential for life elsewhere.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it travels through the Solar System. They aim to gather more data about its composition and trajectory, refining their understanding of its origins before it exits our region of space forever.</p>
