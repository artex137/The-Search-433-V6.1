      <h2>Everything we know about Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object approaching Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object first identified by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in July, is expected to reach its closest point to Earth today, October 29. NASA has stated that the comet poses no threat to Earth and will remain approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million kilometres) away from the planet.</p>

<p>This comet has sparked interest due to its unusual characteristics and behaviour. Experts, including Harvard University scientist Avi Loeb, have suggested that it may not be a naturally formed object. Loeb has raised concerns about the need for global policies regarding potential extraterrestrial encounters, emphasizing the importance of preparing for unknown threats from space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Identification:</strong> First identified in July 2023 by NASA's ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> Approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> Expected around October 30, 2025, at 1.4 AU (about 210 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Third interstellar object recorded in the solar system</li>
    <li><strong>International Asteroid Warning Network:</strong> Added 3I/ATLAS to its list of threats</li>
    <li><strong>Notable emissions:</strong> Carbon dioxide, water, water ice, and carbonyl sulphide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023 by NASA’s ATLAS. Since its discovery, it has exhibited unusual behaviour that has led to debates within the scientific community about its nature. Avi Loeb has been vocal about the potential for the object to be an alien craft, citing its atypical characteristics.</p>

<p>As it nears Earth, Loeb has urged global leaders to take the possibility of extraterrestrial technology seriously. NASA has consistently clarified that the comet does not pose any threat to our planet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away. The closest it will approach our planet is about 1.8 astronomical units.” – NASA</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I believe that we need an international organisation that will make policy decisions about such an object.” – Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system. Its unique characteristics have led to discussions about the implications of potential extraterrestrial technology. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has classified it as a unique challenge for predicting its path due to its hyperbolic trajectory.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, scientists will monitor its behaviour and emissions. Further studies will focus on understanding its composition and origins, while discussions regarding international policies for potential extraterrestrial encounters are expected to continue.</p>
