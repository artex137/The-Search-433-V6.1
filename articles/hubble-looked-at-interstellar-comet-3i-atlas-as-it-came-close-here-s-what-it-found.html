      <h2>Hubble observes interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth</h2>
<p>Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope has re-observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, located about 178 million miles from Earth, last month. The Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 captured the comet's movement against a backdrop of streaked stars, highlighting its rapid trajectory.</p>

<p>This observation is part of a coordinated campaign by Nasa and various international observatories aimed at understanding this rare interstellar object. The campaign has involved a dozen spacecraft and telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope and Mars orbiters, to study the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by an ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
  <li>The comet is estimated to be between 5 and 8 billion years old.</li>
  <li>It is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 170 million miles.</li>
  <li>Indian scientists at the Physical Research Laboratory used a 1.2-metre telescope in Mount Abu for observations between November 12 and 15, 2025.</li>
  <li>The observation campaign has included contributions from Nasa assets such as the STEREO mission and the Lucy mission.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by an ATLAS telescope in Chile, confirming its hyperbolic trajectory from outside the solar system. Following this, Nasa launched a system-wide observation campaign, engaging various telescopes and spacecraft.</p>
<p>Between November 12 and 15, 2025, Indian scientists captured images and spectroscopy of the comet using a telescope at Mount Abu. Hubble re-observed the comet last month, providing detailed images of its movement.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to approach Earth closely on December 19, 2025, before continuing its journey through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “There is no evidence supporting online rumours that the comet is an alien spaceship passing through our solar system,” stated US Congressman George Whitesides of the House Science Committee.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observations of comet 3I/ATLAS are significant as they represent one of the most comprehensive investigations into an interstellar object. Previous interstellar objects have prompted speculation about their origins and nature, but scientific efforts continue to focus on understanding their true characteristics.</p>
<p>International collaboration has been vital in piecing together the story of 3I/ATLAS, with telescopes and spacecraft from around the world contributing to the research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its path through the inner solar system, scientists anticipate more detailed images and data, particularly as it approaches Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026. Ongoing observations will enhance understanding of materials from distant planetary systems.</p>
