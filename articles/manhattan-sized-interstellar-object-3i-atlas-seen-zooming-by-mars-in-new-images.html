      <h2>Manhattan-sized interstellar object 3I/ATLAS seen zooming by Mars in new images</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has released the first images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it passed within 12 million miles of Mars on October 4, 2025. NASA has not provided additional information due to a government shutdown that has left much of its communications department furloughed.</p>

<p>The images, captured by ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, show a fuzzy white dot in the Martian sky, representing the glowing coma of 3I/ATLAS. Nick Thomas, Principal Investigator of the CaSSIS camera, noted that the observation was challenging due to the object's faintness, being 10,000 to 100,000 times dimmer than typical targets. NASA also shared images recorded by its Perseverance rover, but details regarding 3I/ATLAS were not explicitly labeled.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed within 12 million miles of Mars on October 4, 2025.</li>
    <li>First images were released by the European Space Agency on October 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object was captured by seven orbiters from various agencies.</li>
    <li>NASA's communications department has been largely furloughed due to the government shutdown.</li>
    <li>Data and images from NASA regarding 3I/ATLAS will be released once the shutdown is resolved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 4, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars. Images were taken by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and NASA's Perseverance rover during this time. Following the close pass, the ESA released initial images on October 7, 2025. However, NASA has not released further details due to the ongoing government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target,” said Nick Thomas, Principal Investigator of the CaSSIS camera.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The mission is still on,” assured NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens regarding the status of ongoing observations and data collection.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The close pass of 3I/ATLAS highlights ongoing interest in interstellar objects and their observation. The ESA and NASA have collaborated on various missions to study celestial bodies, but the current government shutdown has limited NASA's ability to share findings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to release more data and images related to 3I/ATLAS once the government shutdown concludes and normal operations resume.</p>
