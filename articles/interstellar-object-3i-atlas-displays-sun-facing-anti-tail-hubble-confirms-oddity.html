      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Displays Sun-Facing Anti-Tail — Hubble Confirms Oddity</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has displayed a unique anti-tail while travelling through space, as confirmed by the Hubble Space Telescope. The object, first spotted in July 2025 by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope, is currently moving at approximately 137,000 miles per hour (220,000 kilometers per hour) and will come no closer than 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has captured the attention of astronomers as it challenges existing notions of cometary behavior. The anti-tail, which appears to trail towards the sun, offers insights into the composition and evolution of objects formed around other stars, prompting a re-evaluation of the materials that make up this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: 137,000 miles per hour (220,000 kilometers per hour)</li>
    <li>Initial sighting: July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 170 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Diameter of nucleus: Not less than 1,400 feet (440 meters)</li>
    <li>Venting: Approximately 40 kilograms per second of methanol vapour</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope, marking its entry into astronomical records as only the third known interstellar body. Following its discovery, Hubble captured images that revealed the object's unusual anti-tail, prompting further scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>As astronomers continued to study 3I/ATLAS, they noted its high speed and peculiar trajectory, leading to a deeper investigation into its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anti-tail is merely an optical effect, not a violation of physics, but it requires a very specific set of viewing conditions to be visible,” said Dr. Robert McNaught of the Australian National University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the earlier findings of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which also provided unique insights into interstellar objects. The study of such bodies has become increasingly important for understanding cosmic chemistry and the formation of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers are racing to gather data on 3I/ATLAS during its flyby, as this event provides a rare opportunity to study material from outside our solar system without deploying a space probe. Continued analysis will focus on the object's chemical composition and its implications for our understanding of interstellar bodies.</p>
