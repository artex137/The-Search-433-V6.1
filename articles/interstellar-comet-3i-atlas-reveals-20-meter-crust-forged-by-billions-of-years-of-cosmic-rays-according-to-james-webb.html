      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas reveals 20-meter crust forged by billions of years of cosmic rays, according to James Webb</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has identified a crust 15 to 20 meters deep on the surface of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, located 445 million kilometers from Earth as of August 2025. This crust has formed over billions of years due to exposure to galactic cosmic rays during the comet's journey through the Milky Way.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks 3I/Atlas as the third confirmed interstellar object and provides insights into the composition and evolution of bodies that originate outside the solar system. Researchers from the Royal Belgian Institute of Space Aeronomy have observed chemical changes on the comet's surface, notably the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Located 445 million kilometers from Earth as of August 2025.</li>
    <li>Reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Comet's speed exceeds 210,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Coma dominated by carbon dioxide, which is eight times more abundant than water.</li>
    <li>Estimated age of the comet is around 7 billion years.</li>
    <li>Emission of 129 kg of CO2 per second detected in the core.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has been under observation since. It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, where solar heat began the sublimation of its outer layer, revealing unique characteristics.</p>
<p>In August 2025, researchers noted the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide on the comet's surface, highlighting the impact of cosmic rays over billions of years. The comet's increased luminosity and bluish hue resulted from the release of volatile gases.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The crust of 3I/Atlas accumulated the effects of these interactions on galactic scales, altering only its outer layers while preserving the interior,” said researchers from the Royal Belgian Institute of Space Aeronomy.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is one of the few interstellar objects studied, alongside 2I/Borisov, which has provided valuable information about the differences between solar and interstellar comets. Unlike solar comets, 3I/Atlas has undergone significant changes due to its lack of a heliospheric shield, exposing it to constant cosmic radiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from James Webb and other telescopes to compare spectra from before and after perihelion, aiming to map the original composition of the comet's nucleus and further understand its evolution.</p>
