      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Offers Insights into Cosmic History</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered a unique interstellar object, known as 3I/ATLAS, racing through the outer Solar System since its detection on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) observatory in Chile. Early findings suggest that this comet may be billions of years older than the Sun, potentially offering insights into the origins of our galaxy.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about cosmic history. Researchers believe that 3I/ATLAS could be a remnant from the Milky Way’s early era, which may provide a rare opportunity to study ancient stellar material. Scientists are working to analyze the comet's properties before it leaves the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
<li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
<li><strong>Detection Location:</strong> ATLAS observatory, Chile</li>
<li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> 8 to 14 billion years</li>
<li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> Late October 2025</li>
<li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 2025</li>
<li><strong>Projected Ejection from Solar System:</strong> March 2026</li>
<li><strong>Velocity:</strong> 58 kilometres per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS began with its detection on July 1, 2025. Initial observations indicated that it was moving on a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin. As research progressed, it was determined that the comet is much older than the Solar System, potentially originating from a region housing some of the oldest stars. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun in late October 2025 and will approach Earth in December 2025, before being ejected back into interstellar space in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS offers a rare chance to study material forged around ancient stars,” said Associate Professor Michele Bannister of the University of Canterbury.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Despite the consensus that comet 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, it has been surrounded by controversy,” noted Avi Loeb, a Harvard University astrophysicist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor observed, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unique characteristics, including its age and chemical composition, distinguish it from typical Solar System comets, which are generally younger.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists have a limited window to study 3I/ATLAS's material properties and behaviour before it disappears back into interstellar space. Observations will continue until the comet’s ejection in March 2026, as researchers seek to unlock the secrets of this ancient cosmic relic.</p>
