      <h2>Sky Spectacle In Clinton Attributed To European Rocket, Not Aliens</h2>

<p>A glowing object spotted in the night sky over Clinton, Maine, on Tuesday has been confirmed as rocket exhaust from a recent launch by the European Space Agency, local authorities said. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting has drawn significant attention on social media, prompting the Clinton Police Department to clarify the situation. They humorously reassured residents that the phenomenon was not extraterrestrial in nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on Tuesday night, specific time not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Location: Clinton, Maine.</li>
    <li>Object identified as rocket exhaust from an Ariane 6 rocket launch.</li>
    <li>Launch conducted by the European Space Agency.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities reported.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Tuesday night, residents of Clinton reported seeing a strange glowing sphere in the sky. Many took to social media to share images and express their curiosity about the object. The Clinton Police Department responded with a statement to clarify the nature of the sighting.</p>

<p>Experts from the Versant Astronomy Center and Jordan Planetarium at the University of Maine in Orono confirmed that the object was not an alien spacecraft but rather rocket exhaust from a recent launch.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "No need to panic, Clinton. We have confirmed that the strange glowing spiral in the sky tonight was not A. aliens B. a wormhole C. your neighbor’s blueberry kush vape cloud drifting into orbit," the Clinton Police Department stated on their Facebook page.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "This was an Ariane 6 rocket launch from the European Space Agency. The exhaust can sometimes make these patterns," said a representative from the Versant Astronomy Center. "It is somewhat common, as it normally is from the rocket exhaust. The particles freeze in the upper atmosphere and reflect sunlight - it almost looked a bit like a spiral galaxy! But just rocket exhaust."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Sightings of unusual objects in the sky often lead to speculation about extraterrestrial life. This incident highlights the importance of accurate information from authorities to dispel myths and conspiracy theories that can arise from such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
