<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The sighting occurred late Monday night when the witness observed a large disc-shaped object hovering low over a field adjacent to Route 41A. The resident noted the object remained stationary while lights surrounding it spun rapidly, producing a mesmerizing effect.</p>

<p>According to the report, the UFO made no sound, even with the windows of the witness's truck open. This lack of noise contributed to the surreal experience, as the lights illuminated the field below.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
