      <h2>Space agency breaks silence on 'foreign' interstellar object spotted soaring past Mars</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that the comet 3I/ATLAS, identified earlier this year, has been passing Mars between October 1 and October 7. The comet is not expected to pose any threat to Earth, remaining approximately 170 million miles away during its flyby.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object to originate from interstellar space. Previous interstellar objects include Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, and Borisov, found in 2019. ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter attempted to capture images of the comet as it passed Mars, highlighting its faintness and the challenges faced by the spacecraft's imaging system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed Mars between October 1 and October 7, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at over 66,000 km/h (41 miles per second).</li>
    <li>It is approximately 18.6 million miles away from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter during observations.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to the Sun around Halloween 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will remain roughly 170 million miles away from Earth during its flyby.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile confirmed the identity of 3I/ATLAS as a foreign interstellar object. This marked it as the third known interstellar object following Oumuamua and Borisov.</p>
<p>Between October 1 and October 7, 2023, ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter attempted to take images of the comet as it passed Mars.</p>
<p>During these observations, the comet was approximately 30 million km from Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Nick Thomas</strong>, principal investigator for the ExoMars imaging system, stated: “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    The ESA commented on social media: “All eyes on #3I/ATLAS ☄️ Our Mars Express & ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will observe the comet around its closest approach to Mars on 3 October 2025, when 3I/ATLAS will be around 30 million km from the red planet.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its speed and trajectory, which has led to speculation about its nature. Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has expressed concerns that the object could be artificial, raising questions about the need for international policy regarding potential extraterrestrial encounters.</p>
<p>Despite these discussions, space agencies like NASA have reiterated confidence that 3I/ATLAS is simply a comet, dismissing fears of it being a hostile object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA and other space agencies will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and later departs into deep space. Further observations will occur at its closest approach to Mars in October 2025.</p>
