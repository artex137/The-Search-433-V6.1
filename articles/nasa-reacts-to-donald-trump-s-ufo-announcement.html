      <h2>NASA Reacts To Donald Trump’s UFO Announcement</h2>

<p>A spokesperson for NASA has issued a statement following President Donald Trump’s announcement on Thursday that he will direct his administration to release government files related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and potential extraterrestrial life. Trump made the announcement on the social media platform Truth Social, stating he would instruct Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to start locating and publicizing these government files.</p>

<p>This announcement has sparked renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life, with authorities emphasizing transparency. Trump stated, “Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs).” The statement reflects a growing fascination with the topic, as a 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 65 percent of Americans believe intelligent life may exist on other planets.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he would direct the Secretary of War and other agencies to release files related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life. This announcement followed a growing public interest in the subject, particularly after former President Barack Obama addressed the topic in a recent interview.</p>

<p>In an interview, Obama stated, “They’re real,” in response to a question about aliens, but quickly clarified that he had not seen evidence of their existence during his presidency. This comment went viral and contributed to heightened interest in UFOs.</p>

<p>On Friday, NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens responded to Trump’s announcement by reaffirming the agency's commitment to open science and public participation in its data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We continue to embrace President Trump’s open science commitment as an agency,” NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens posted on X. “We have fostered open science since our inception so that the public can build upon our innovations.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“As [NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman] has said, there are certainly things he’s come across in the job that he can’t explain… but they relate more to unnecessarily costly programs than they do to extraterrestrial life!”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Representative Nancy Mace stated on X, “Tonight, President Trump is directing full disclosure of UAP and UFO files. The truth belongs to the American people.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life has surged in recent years, partly due to public figures discussing the topic. Former President Obama’s comments during a podcast interview have contributed to this trend, sparking debates and discussions across social media platforms. The Pentagon has maintained that it has not found any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial activity, even as interest continues to grow.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the wake of Trump’s announcement, it remains to be seen how quickly the government will act to identify and release the requested files. Further developments are anticipated as the public and lawmakers continue to seek transparency regarding UFOs and related phenomena.</p>
