      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-24 18:57 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS a Cosmic Time Capsule</h2>
<p>A team of astronomers from the Center for Research in Information and Communication Technologies (CITIC) at the University of A Coruña in Spain has confirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is a cosmic time capsule carrying secrets from another part of the galaxy. The comet was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it offers insights into materials formed around other stars millions of years ago. Researchers believe that analyzing 3I/ATLAS is akin to peering into the distant past of the Universe. Authorities, including the European Space Agency (ESA), are using data from their Gaia mission to trace the comet's origins and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date Detected:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Detection System:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Beyond the solar system</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Research Institution:</strong> Center for Research in Information and Communication Technologies (CITIC), University of A Coruña</li>
    <li><strong>Key Researcher:</strong> Xabier Pérez Couto</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected by ATLAS in Chile on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, researchers at CITIC began studying its trajectory, which spans over 10 million years. They utilized data from the ESA's Gaia mission to trace its journey through the Milky Way.</p>
<p>The team has confirmed that the comet will not come closer than 270 million kilometers to Earth, allowing for safe observation from Earth-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet was not born in our solar system, but much farther away,” said Xabier Pérez Couto. “Each interstellar comet is like an open window to the past of the Universe.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Studying 3I/ATLAS is like examining the DNA of other solar systems,” Pérez Couto added. “It provides clues about how worlds form, the appearance of essential minerals, and the early development of organic compounds—key ingredients for life.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object after ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Interstellar comets, unlike those originating from the solar system, offer unique insights into the primordial materials from which planets form around other stars. This research challenges existing theories about solar system formation and interstellar material evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The CITIC team continues to develop sophisticated numerical models and simulations to study interstellar objects. Their work positions Spain as a key player in international astronomy, with ongoing research aimed at uncovering more about the processes occurring in other stellar systems.</p>
