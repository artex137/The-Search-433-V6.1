      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS An Alien Probe? James Webb Telescope Finds 'Anomalous' Methane on Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been the subject of speculation regarding its origins after the James Webb Space Telescope detected unusual methane emissions. The comet, discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii, has passed the Sun and is now moving through interstellar space.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system. Scientists are investigating the comet's unusual characteristics, including its high carbon dioxide-to-water ratio and the recent detection of methane, which raises questions about its formation and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is approximately 2.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>James Webb Space Telescope observed methane emissions on 15–16 and 27 December 2025.</li>
    <li>Methane production was measured at 13.7% and then 27% of the water production rate across two observations.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was flagged as an interstellar object shortly after its discovery in July 2025. Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope in December 2025 revealed unexpected methane emissions, which had not been detected in earlier observations. The comet has continued to display complex behaviour as it moves away from the Sun.</p>

<p>Prior to its perihelion, other instruments like the SPHEREx mission noted carbon monoxide but no methane emissions. The recent findings have prompted discussions among scientists regarding the comet's unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every serious line of evidence points to 3I/ATLAS being an interstellar comet, not a stealth spacecraft.” - NASA officials</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a completely natural object.” - Physicist Brian Cox</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discoveries of 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, marking a growing interest in interstellar objects. The unusual features of 3I/ATLAS have sparked debates among scientists, with some suggesting the need to consider “technological origins” alongside natural explanations.</p>

<p>While some researchers have speculated about the possibility of artificial origins, the scientific consensus remains that the comet is a natural object, consistent with known characteristics of comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it recedes from the Sun, hoping to gather further data that could provide insights into its composition and the broader nature of interstellar objects.</p>
