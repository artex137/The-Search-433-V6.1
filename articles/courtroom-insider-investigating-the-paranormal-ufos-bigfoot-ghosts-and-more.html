      <h2>COURTROOM INSIDER | Investigating the paranormal, UFOs, Bigfoot, ghosts and more</h2>

<p>On “Courtroom Insider,” former police officers Dave Rich and Marianne Robb have discussed their new organization, the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon Police Department (UAP PD), aimed at assisting first responders who encounter paranormal experiences. The segment aired on East Idaho News, highlighting the challenges faced by officers who report sightings of unidentified objects, including UFOs and Bigfoot.</p>

<p>This initiative matters as it addresses the psychological and professional support needs of law enforcement personnel who experience phenomena that defy conventional explanation. Rich, a former police investigator, shared his personal encounter while responding to a call at an empty high school, an experience he described as unprecedented in his career.</p>
