      <h2>UFOs and Paranormal Experiences: Former Officers Launch Support Organization</h2>

<p>Two former police officers have launched an organization to assist first responders who encounter paranormal phenomena, including UFOs, Bigfoot, and ghosts. The initiative, named the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon Police Department (UAP PD), was introduced during a segment of “Courtroom Insider” aired on October 25, 2025.</p>

<p>This initiative matters as it aims to provide support and resources for officers who may experience unusual events while on duty. According to co-founder Dave Rich, the idea stemmed from his own unsettling experience responding to a call at an empty high school years ago.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event aired on October 25, 2025, on “Courtroom Insider.”</li>
    <li>Co-founders: Dave Rich and Marianne Robb.</li>
    <li>Organization: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon Police Department (UAP PD).</li>
    <li>Rich described his experience responding to a paranormal call at a high school.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the segment, Dave Rich detailed his experience as a police investigator responding to an unusual call. He described the incident occurring several years ago at an empty high school, where he encountered phenomena he could not explain. This experience prompted him to team up with fellow former officer Marianne Robb to create UAP PD, which aims to support other first responders facing similar situations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I had never experienced anything like it in my entire career,” said Dave Rich regarding his paranormal encounter. “We want to help other officers who may feel isolated after experiencing something similar.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The formation of UAP PD reflects a growing interest in the study of unidentified phenomena, especially among law enforcement officers. As more individuals report strange occurrences, the need for structured support for first responders has become apparent.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>UAP PD is set to expand its outreach efforts to educate and assist first responders across the country. Further details on their programs and resources are expected to be announced in upcoming weeks.</p>
