      <h2>Private Contractor Claims Responsibility for UFO Sightings in New Jersey</h2>

<p>A private defense contractor at a U.S. Army aviation conference has claimed responsibility for last year’s wave of “UFO” and drone sightings across New Jersey. The event took place in August 2023 at the Army’s UAS and Launched Effects Summit held at Fort Rucker, Alabama. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the sightings.</p>

<p>This claim has prompted interest from authorities and the public regarding the nature of these sightings and the activities of the contractor. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) previously attributed most incidents to hobbyists and recreational pilots, but this new information raises questions about the involvement of private contractors in airspace operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Army’s UAS and Launched Effects Summit</li>
    <li>Date: August 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Fort Rucker, Alabama</li>
    <li>Claim: Contractor said it tested aircraft over New Jersey in November 2024</li>
    <li>Aircraft: Manned, roughly 20-foot-wide, four-winged craft</li>
    <li>Initial sightings: Began over Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, late 2024</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late 2024, a series of alleged drone sightings occurred across New Jersey, starting over Picatinny Arsenal and continuing through early December. The FAA investigated the incidents but did not identify any specific operators or aircraft.</p>
<p>In August 2023, the contractor demonstrated a new aircraft at the Army summit, where an employee claimed responsibility for the New Jersey sightings, stating that the aircraft had been testing its capabilities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,”</blockquote> said an employee of the contractor, according to a source who attended the summit.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Last year, New Jersey experienced a notable increase in reported UFO sightings, which were largely dismissed by authorities as the activity of hobbyists. This recent claim by a private contractor adds a new layer to the narrative surrounding these incidents and raises concerns about transparency in government contracts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities may pursue further investigations into the contractor’s claims and the implications of their activities in civilian airspace. No specific deadlines or next steps have been disclosed at this time.</p>
