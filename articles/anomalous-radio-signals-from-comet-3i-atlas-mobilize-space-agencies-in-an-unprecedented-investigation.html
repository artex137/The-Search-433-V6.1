      <h2>Anomalous radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS mobilize space agencies in an unprecedented investigation</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has emitted anomalous radio signals that have prompted a global investigation led by NASA and other space agencies. This situation has developed since the comet's detection in mid-2025, with the most significant developments occurring in October 2025.</p>

<p>The emission of narrowband radio transmissions has raised questions about the comet's composition and the processes occurring as it travels through our solar system. Authorities aim to determine the origin of these signals before 3I/ATLAS exits the solar system, which will limit future study opportunities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>First identified as the third interstellar object visiting our solar system.</li>
    <li>Emits radio signals captured on October 24, 2025, at 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>Traveling at speeds exceeding 100,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>NASA, ESA, and other agencies are collaborating on the investigation.</li>
    <li>Comet's core diameter estimated between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025. Its trajectory confirmed it as an interstellar object, indicating it would not remain in the solar system. The significant discovery of radio signals occurred on October 24, 2025, when the MeerKAT radio telescope detected narrowband emissions. Initial analyses ruled out known astrophysical phenomena as the source of these signals, prompting further investigation.</p>

<p>Since then, teams specializing in radio astronomy have been conducting detailed analyses to confirm the signals' origin and eliminate potential interference from terrestrial sources. The situation has led to a coordinated effort among leading space agencies to maximize observation opportunities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The intensity and structure of the signal do not correspond to any known astrophysical phenomena associated with comets,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “We are committed to understanding this unique event.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are exploring all possibilities, including the unique chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS,” noted a researcher involved in the investigation. “The likelihood of a natural cause remains overwhelmingly greater.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of radio waves from 3I/ATLAS has sparked vigorous debate within the scientific community regarding their possible causes. Previous interstellar objects like 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have also drawn attention, but 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity due to its anomalous emissions.</p>

<p>The investigation into the comet's signals has led organizations like the Instituto SETI to focus their instruments on the comet, although most scientists treat the possibility of an artificial origin with skepticism.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the signals to determine their origin while ensuring ongoing collaboration among international space agencies. The goal is to gather as much data as possible before 3I/ATLAS exits the solar system.</p>
