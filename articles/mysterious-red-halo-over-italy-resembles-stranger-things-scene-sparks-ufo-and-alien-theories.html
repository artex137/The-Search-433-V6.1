      <h2>'Mysterious Red Halo' Over Italy Resembles Stranger Things Scene, Sparks UFO And Alien Theories</h2>

<p>A glowing red ring has appeared in the night sky above Possagno, a small town in northern Italy, on November 17. The phenomenon, captured by nature photographer Valter Binotto, has sparked widespread speculation about UFOs and alien activity, although no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident has drawn significant attention online, prompting discussions about the nature of the red halo. Authorities and scientists have stated that the phenomenon is not extraterrestrial but related to atmospheric conditions. Binotto previously captured a similar red ring in March 2023, indicating this is the second occurrence of such a display in three years.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of appearance: November 17, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Possagno, northern Italy</li>
    <li>Photographer: Valter Binotto</li>
    <li>Halo size: nearly 200 kilometres across, approximately 100 kilometres above the town</li>
    <li>Previous occurrence: March 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 17, 2023, Valter Binotto captured a striking image of a red halo in the sky over Possagno. The phenomenon quickly went viral on social media, with users comparing it to scenes from the television series Stranger Things. This follows a similar occurrence that Binotto documented in March 2023.</p>

<p>Scientists have identified the red halo as an ELVE, or Emission of Light and Very Low-Frequency Perturbations due to Electromagnetic Pulse Sources, which are created by strong lightning strikes. These events produce a brief electromagnetic pulse that results in a flash of red light.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It’s a unique atmospheric phenomenon,” Binotto stated, emphasizing that the display is rooted in science rather than fantasy.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The latest red ring over Possagno was generated during an intense thunderstorm active that night,” confirmed Spaceweather.com.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>ELVEs are a rare atmospheric occurrence first observed by scientists in 1990. They appear high above the ionosphere and last for only a millisecond, making them difficult to see with the naked eye. Their unusual size and brief nature often lead to misinterpretations as UFOs.</p>

<p>The previous red halo captured by Binotto in March 2023 also garnered significant attention, highlighting the ongoing interest in such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No investigations or further actions are currently planned regarding the incident, as scientists continue to study atmospheric phenomena and educate the public about the nature of ELVEs.</p>
