      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: The Interstellar “Ghost Comet” Haunting Our Solar System This Halloween</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) is currently passing through our solar system, having been discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. It is only the third known interstellar object, following 2017’s 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2019’s 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unique origin and characteristics. It is on a hyperbolic trajectory that will see it exit the solar system after a close encounter with the Sun. Authorities and astronomers worldwide are monitoring the comet as it offers a rare opportunity to study an object from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 58 km/s (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Sun: October 29-30, 2025, at ~1.36 AU</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: ~1.8 AU (270 million km) in December 2025</li>
    <li>Nucleus size: Estimated up to ~5 km (3.5 miles) wide</li>
    <li>Active outgassing: ~40 kg/s of water at 2.9 AU</li>
    <li>Global observation: Major telescopes including Hubble and James Webb are tracking it</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. After its discovery, astronomers quickly identified its hyperbolic path, confirming it as an interstellar object. It reached perihelion on October 29-30, 2025, coming within ~1.36 AU of the Sun. As it continues its journey, it is expected to make its closest approach to Earth in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is an object from a part of the galaxy we’ve never seen up close before,” said Oxford astronomer Chris Lintott, whose team studied 3I/ATLAS's orbit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet,” noted ESA scientist Michael Küppers, addressing speculation about the comet being artificial.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant not only because it is the third confirmed interstellar object but also due to its size and activity. Unlike 1I/ʻOumuamua, which showed no active coma, 3I/ATLAS is actively outgassing and has a visible tail. Its large size and ancient origin, estimated to be between 7 to 11 billion years old, make it a vital object of study for understanding the early galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory, scientists will leverage various space telescopes to observe its features and behavior. Upcoming missions, including ESA’s JUICE probe and NASA’s Europa Clipper, may sample the comet’s tail for further analysis.</p>
