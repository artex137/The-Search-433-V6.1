      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Debate Over Possible Alien Technology</h2>

<p>NEW YORK – Comet 3I/ATLAS, first detected by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025, has generated discussions regarding its unusual trajectory and size, with some experts suggesting it may be a form of alien technology. The comet, traveling at 61 km per second relative to the Sun, is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it offers new insights into interstellar space and the nature of comets. Astronomers have noted that 3I/ATLAS's unique hyperbolic trajectory indicates it originates from outside our solar system, raising questions about its composition and the processes that formed it. The object has drawn the attention of both professional and amateur astronomers worldwide, with the Minor Planet Center (MPC) collecting 122 observations from 31 different observatories shortly after its announcement.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is traveling at 61 km per second relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet has a nucleus potentially spanning 1 to 3 miles across.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may weigh up to 33 billion tons, significantly more than its predecessors.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass close to Mars on October 3, 2025, at a distance of 28 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The James Webb Space Telescope has detected a carbon dioxide-to-water ratio of 7.6 to 1 in the comet’s coma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope. Earlier images indicate the comet was visible as early as June 14, 2025, but was likely overlooked due to its position among dense star fields. Initial observations were submitted to the MPC shortly after its discovery, leading to a collaborative effort among astronomers.</p>

<p>The comet is predicted to make its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, allowing spacecraft orbiting the planet to capture detailed observations. It will then reach perihelion on October 29, 2025, passing just inside Mars’ orbit before continuing toward a close encounter with Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, stated, “3I/ATLAS is a major anomaly that could give us new insight into interstellar space.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following the discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its size and mass are unprecedented compared to these predecessors, which raises questions about the formation and evolution of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars and the Sun, astronomers will continue to observe its trajectory and physical properties, gathering data that could enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>
