      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Dazzles As It Swoops Behind the Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on Wednesday. The comet has not been visible from Earth since September, but space-based observatories have tracked its approach, noting its increasing brightness.</p>

<p>This event is significant as interstellar comets provide rare opportunities to study the composition of other solar systems. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are analyzing data from their observatories to gather insights about this unusual celestial object, only the third of its kind ever detected.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on Wednesday.</li>
    <li>It has not been visible from Earth since September.</li>
    <li>At perihelion, the comet brightened to about magnitude 9.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency utilized STEREO-A, SOHO, and GOES-19 satellites for observations.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to briefly reappear in Earth’s view in late November or early December.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth will occur around December 19.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September, 3I/ATLAS became invisible from Earth as it moved toward the Sun. On Wednesday, it reached perihelion, transforming from a solid to gas as it approached the Sun.</p>
<p>Observations made by NASA’s and the European Space Agency’s satellites detailed the comet's brightening and its unique gas emissions, which contributed to its visible tail.</p>
<p>Researchers have published findings regarding the comet's unusual characteristics and brightness in a study posted to arXiv on Wednesday.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS has brightened far more rapidly than comets originating from the Oort cloud,” said Qicheng Zhang of Lowell Observatory. “This suggests it may have unique properties.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet appears distinctly bluer than the Sun, indicating its gas emissions,” said Karl Battams of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, with 3I/ATLAS being only the third identified. Previous studies have shown that such comets can provide insights into the formation of solar systems. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its high carbon dioxide to water ratio, have piqued the interest of astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers expect to observe 3I/ATLAS again in late November or early December. Spacecraft, including NASA’s Psyche and Lucy missions, may provide further insights into the comet's origins and makeup as it continues its journey away from the solar system.</p>
