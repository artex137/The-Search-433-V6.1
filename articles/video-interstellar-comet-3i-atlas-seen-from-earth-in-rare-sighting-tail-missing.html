      <h2>Video: Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas seen from Earth in rare sighting, tail missing</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed from Earth in a notable celestial event on November 11, 2025, by Spanish astronomer Joan Miquel Gonzlez Navarra at Sabadell Observatory in Catalonia, Spain. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it allows astronomers to study a rare interstellar object, the third of its kind observed in our solar system. Global space agencies, including NASA and ESA, have tracked 3IATLAS since its detection in July 2025. The comet’s unusual characteristics and rapid speed provide valuable insights into interstellar material.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3IATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, passing approximately 130 million miles from it.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest pass near Earth in December 2025, at a distance of about 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 170 million miles).</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits a large nucleus, potentially over 5 kilometers wide.</li>
    <li>3IATLAS travels at speeds up to 1,52,000 mph near perihelion.</li>
    <li>Viewing is recommended with an 8-inch or larger telescope in the pre-dawn eastern sky.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3IATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its detection, global space agencies have closely monitored its trajectory. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, and is expected to pass near Earth in December 2025.</p>

<p>Images of the comet were captured by Gonzlez Navarra on November 11, 2025, despite some blurriness due to the comet's low altitude in the sky. The observation has been described as "still amazing to see."</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is a rare opportunity to study material from beyond our solar system and unlock clues about the cosmos,” said Joan Miquel Gonzlez Navarra regarding the sighting.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3IATLAS is the third known interstellar object observed in our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I Borisov in 2019. These observations have contributed to the understanding of the dynamic nature of our cosmic neighborhood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to track 3IATLAS as it approaches Earth in December 2025. Observations during this time are expected to provide further insights into the characteristics of interstellar comets.</p>
