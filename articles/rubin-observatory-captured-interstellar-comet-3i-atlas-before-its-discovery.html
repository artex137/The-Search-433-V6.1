      <h2>Rubin Observatory Captured Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Before Its Discovery</h2>

<p>The NSF–DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory has recorded interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in wide-field commissioning data approximately ten days before its official discovery on July 1, 2025. The comet was later identified in archived Rubin exposures after the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) announced its discovery from Chile.</p>

<p>This early detection is significant as it extends the comet’s observational arc, improving orbital calculations and supporting early activity modeling. It also demonstrates the capabilities of Rubin’s survey system to capture faint, fast-moving interstellar objects during routine operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on June 21, 2025, in data from Rubin Observatory.</li>
    <li>ATLAS officially announced the comet on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Rubin Observatory's data capture occurred during system validation observations.</li>
    <li>Rubin's imaging system includes a 3200-megapixel LSST Camera.</li>
    <li>The comet was already active at the time of Rubin's observation.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 21, 2025, the Rubin Observatory captured data of comet 3I/ATLAS during its commissioning phase. The image showed a faint, moving object consistent with the comet's predicted trajectory. The ATLAS detected the comet on July 1, 2025, and identified it as originating from interstellar space.</p>
<p>After the announcement, astronomers confirmed the detection of the comet in Rubin's earlier images. The observations provided crucial data for understanding the comet's orbit and activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The earlier detection lengthens the observational arc, improving solution stability," said a spokesperson from NSF–NOIRLab. “It also confirms that the comet was developing a coma well before its official discovery.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing understanding of interstellar objects. The prior discoveries of 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019 have reshaped scientists' views on small-body populations beyond the Solar System. The detection of 3I/ATLAS has prompted global coordination among astronomers to gather data on its trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the Vera C. Rubin Observatory transitions into full science operations, it is expected to discover millions of Solar System objects. The capabilities demonstrated by the early detection of 3I/ATLAS may increase the frequency of early detections for rare interstellar visitors.</p>
