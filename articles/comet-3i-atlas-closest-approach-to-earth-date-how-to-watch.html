      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Closest Approach to Earth: Date & How to Watch</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing within approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 270 million kilometres, according to NASA. The comet, first discovered in 2025, is notable for its bright nucleus and distinctive tail, which will be visible using binoculars or telescopes.</p>

<p>The close flyby of Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant for both astronomers and skywatchers. It is only the third known interstellar comet to visit our solar system, providing a rare opportunity for scientists to study material from outside our star system. Observers are encouraged to find locations with minimal light pollution to enhance viewing conditions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Not visible to the naked eye; requires a telescope with at least an 8-inch aperture or a large pair of binoculars</li>
    <li><strong>Best Time to View:</strong> Early morning hours before dawn</li>
    <li><strong>Location in Sky:</strong> Constellation Leo</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2025. It is set to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025. During this flyby, it will be approximately 1.8 astronomical units away from our planet.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to appear as a fuzzy, glowing object with a faint tail when viewed through binoculars or a telescope. Observers are advised to look toward the northeastern sky in the hours before sunrise.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The close flyby of Comet 3I/ATLAS is a major event because it is only the third known interstellar comet to visit our solar system,” NASA stated. “By studying the dust and gases released as the comet heats up, scientists gain crucial insight into the chemical makeup and formation of comets and planets around other stars.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS offers a unique opportunity to study the origins of water and organic molecules on Earth. Its passage through our solar system will help astronomers gain insights into the early solar system and the formation of planetary bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to prepare for the comet's arrival by planning viewing sessions in locations with low light pollution. Apps like SkySafari or Stellarium can assist in locating the comet in the sky.</p>
