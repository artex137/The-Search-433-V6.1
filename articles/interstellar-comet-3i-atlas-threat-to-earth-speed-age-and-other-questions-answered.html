      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas: Threat to Earth, Speed, Age and Other Questions Answered</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, first observed on July 1 by the ATLAS Survey Telescope in Chile, has sparked significant interest among astronomers and the public. The object is moving at an extraordinary speed of 60,000 km/second and is believed to be between 7.6 and 14 billion years old, making it older than our solar system. Authorities have stated that 3I/Atlas will safely pass by Earth in December 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/Atlas is crucial as it challenges existing knowledge about comets and interstellar objects. Its unusual trajectory and characteristics have led to various theories, including speculation about it being a potential alien spacecraft. This has heightened public curiosity and concern, prompting scientists to gather more data on the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First observed on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS Survey Telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Estimated speed: 60,000 km/second (221,000 km/hr).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (273 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth currently: about 3.5 AU (523 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>Age: between 7.6 and 14 billion years old.</li>
    <li>Mass: likely greater than 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Diameter of nucleus: estimated between 1 and 46 kilometres, with a consensus around 1 kilometre.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first detected on July 1, 2023, during observations by the ATLAS telescope. Following this, data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) revealed that the comet had been imaged in May, showing a significant increase in brightness between May 7 and June 3. This anomaly in brightness raised questions among scientists about its composition and behavior.</p>
<p>The comet is currently moving towards the inner solar system and is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/Atlas has a strange trajectory. Its path is careening through the solar system in a way that comets that reside in our solar system do not typically behave,” said Harvard scientist Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If it is 33 billion tons in mass, it is an anomaly for a regular comet,” stated a researcher involved in the studies of 3I/Atlas.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/Atlas have prompted comparisons to previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, which was observed in 2017. Scientists are increasingly interested in studying these objects to better understand their origins and potential implications for our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches the inner solar system. Ongoing observations from various telescopes will aim to gather more data on its trajectory, composition, and any anomalies that may arise as it nears perihelion.</p>
