      <h2>Dust Properties of the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Revealed by Optical and Near-Infrared Polarimetry</h2>

<p>Researchers have presented new polarimetric observations of the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, including its first near-infrared polarimetric measurements, as detailed in a study released on January 13, 2026. The study highlights the unique dust properties of 3I/ATLAS, which differ from typical Solar System comets.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances the understanding of extraterrestrial materials and their origins. The findings suggest that the polarimetric behavior of 3I/ATLAS reflects intrinsic optical properties of refractory dust particles rather than transient volatile activity, indicating its composition may provide insights into the building blocks of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Date:</strong> January 13, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Measurement Range:</strong> Visible R C band (0.64 µm) to near-infrared K s band (2.25 µm)</li>
    <li><strong>PPC Characteristics:</strong> Unusually large polarization amplitude</li>
    <li><strong>Peak Wavelength for PCC:</strong> 1.5–2.0 µm</li>
    <li><strong>Research Authors:</strong> Seungwon Choi, Masateru Ishiguro, Jun Takahashi, among others</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 13, 2026, researchers published their findings on the polarimetric observations of 3I/ATLAS. They utilized imaging polarimeters to assess the degree of linear polarization across different wavelengths. The study confirmed that the polarization phase curve (PPC) of 3I/ATLAS shows significant differences from typical Solar System comets.</p>

<p>Prior to this study, observations indicated that 3I/ATLAS had perihelion lying within the water snow line. Researchers noted that the PPC showed no significant change during this period, suggesting stable intrinsic properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our results indicate that 3I/ATLAS preserves polarimetric properties characteristic of a primitive cometary planetesimal formed in another planetary system,” said Masateru Ishiguro, one of the study's authors.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies of interstellar objects have often focused on transitory volatile activity. However, this research suggests a different approach, emphasizing the importance of understanding the intrinsic properties of these celestial bodies. The findings align with trends in astrophysical research that seek to decipher the origins and compositions of materials found in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations are necessary to explore the implications of 3I/ATLAS's dust composition for understanding other planetary systems. Researchers plan to continue their studies to refine the knowledge of interstellar materials and their roles in the formation of celestial objects.</p>
