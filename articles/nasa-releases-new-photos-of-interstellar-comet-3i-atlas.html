      <h2>NASA releases new photos of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is just the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system. The images, taken by various NASA spacecraft from late September through mid-October, show the comet as a bright point of light surrounded by a halo of gas and dust.</p>

<p>This release matters because it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study an interstellar object up close. The comet was first detected in July, generating significant interest in both scientific and amateur astronomy communities. NASA officials have stated that the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS could yield insights into star systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The new images were taken from late September to mid-October 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will fly by Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of roughly 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA expects the James Webb Space Telescope to observe the comet in December.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its closest point to the sun at the end of October 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected, sparking interest among scientists and amateur astronomers. NASA captured images of the comet from late September through mid-October as it traversed the inner solar system. The images were not released until now due to a government shutdown that affected NASA's operations. The comet reached its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and will fly by Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said, “We certainly haven’t seen any techno signatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies, stated, “This is a new scientific opportunity, and it’s a new window into the makeups and histories of other solar systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Before 3I/ATLAS, the only two confirmed interstellar objects to have entered our solar system were the cigar-shaped Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The rarity of such objects makes their study significant for understanding the origins and compositions of celestial bodies from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue studying comet 3I/ATLAS as it progresses through the solar system. Additional observations and data from NASA's fleet of spacecraft are expected in the coming weeks.</p>
