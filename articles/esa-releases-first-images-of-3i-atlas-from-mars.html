      <h2>ESA Releases First Images Of 3I-ATLAS From Mars</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has released the first images of comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by its Mars orbiters on 3 October 2025. This interstellar comet, discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, passed within 30 million kilometres of Mars, offering a unique opportunity for scientific observation.</p>

<p>The comet is significant as it is only the third known interstellar comet, potentially carrying ancient material from the early galaxy. ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express shifted their focus from Mars to observe this rare event, despite the technical challenges posed by the comet's faintness compared to the Martian surface.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars occurred on 3 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars during closest approach: 30 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Comet is estimated to be billions of years older than the Sun.</li>
    <li>ExoMars’ CaSSIS camera recorded the comet, which is 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than typical targets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its trajectory, it was confirmed to be an interstellar object. On 3 October 2025, ESA's ExoMars and Mars Express observed the comet as it passed close to Mars. The cameras captured images of the comet's nucleus and its expanding halo of gas and dust.</p>

<p>Researchers are currently analysing data from both Mars orbiters to detect any chemical signatures from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” said Nick Thomas, CaSSIS principal investigator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one,” said Colin Wilson, ESA’s project scientist for both missions.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet identified, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These comets provide valuable insight into the composition and conditions of the early solar system. The rarity of such events makes the observations from ESA's missions particularly important for understanding the evolution of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will aim to observe 3I/ATLAS again as it approaches the Sun, with results expected in early 2026. Meanwhile, preparations are underway for the Comet Interceptor mission, set to launch in 2029, which will target future interstellar objects.</p>
