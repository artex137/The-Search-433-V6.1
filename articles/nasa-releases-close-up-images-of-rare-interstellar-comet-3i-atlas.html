      <h2>NASA Releases Close-Up Images of Rare Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>NASA has unveiled detailed close-up images of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, only the third confirmed object from another star system to visit our solar system. The images were released on Wednesday, November 23, 2025, following the comet's harmless passage by Mars last month. Currently, the comet is approximately 190 million miles from Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study an object that may originate from a star system older than our own. NASA has employed three spacecraft near Mars to capture images of the comet, and the European Space Agency (ESA) has also contributed observations. NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, stated that this event has attracted telescope operators from around the world.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered over the summer by a telescope in Chile.</li>
<li>The comet passed Mars last month and is now 190 million miles from Earth.</li>
<li>NASA's spacecraft captured images from a distance of 18 million miles.</li>
<li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth—167 million miles—around mid-December.</li>
<li>It ranges from 1,444 feet to 3.5 miles in diameter.</li>
<li>Italian astronomer Gianluca Masi provided images from Manciano, Italy.</li>
<li>ESA’s Juice spacecraft has observed the comet, with data expected in February.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in the summer of 2025 by a telescope in Chile. It passed by Mars in October 2025 and is currently on a trajectory that will bring it closest to Earth in mid-December 2025. NASA's spacecraft have been capturing images since then, with the latest close-up images released on November 23, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“3I/Atlas is a fascinating and rare opportunity,” said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, NASA’s acting astrophysics director.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“3I/Atlas is a comet,” confirmed Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, dismissing rumors of alien ships.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“3I/Atlas is a window into the deep past,” NASA scientist Tom Statler remarked, highlighting its historical significance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/Atlas is noteworthy as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following previous discoveries. Its study offers insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies, particularly those predating Earth and the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor the comet as it approaches Earth, with further data from ESA’s Juice spacecraft expected to arrive in February 2026. The scientific community is preparing for additional observations and analysis of the comet's characteristics.</p>
