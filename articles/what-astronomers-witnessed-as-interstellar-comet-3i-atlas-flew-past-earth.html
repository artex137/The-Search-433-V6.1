      <h2>What astronomers witnessed as interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS flew past Earth</h2>

<p>On 19 December 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, passing at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 270 million kilometres. The event has captivated astronomers and the public alike, providing a unique opportunity for scientific observation without any reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>The flyby of 3I/ATLAS has significant implications for the understanding of celestial objects beyond our solar system. Astronomers have highlighted the importance of studying such interstellar visitors, as they offer insights into the universe's history and the materials that exist outside our solar system. Agencies like NASA have coordinated efforts to observe the comet, collecting valuable data on its composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach distance:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Time of closest approach:</strong> 06:00 GMT</li>
    <li><strong>Involved observatories:</strong> Hubble, Webb, Parker Solar Probe</li>
    <li><strong>Next significant event:</strong> Passing Jupiter in March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As the calendar turned to 19 December 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its nearest point to Earth at about 06:00 GMT. Astronomers had been tracking the comet for months, gathering critical data about its composition and behaviour. Despite its proximity, 3I/ATLAS remained faint and largely invisible to the naked eye, with many observers relying on large amateur telescopes or online livestreams to glimpse the comet.</p>

<p>After passing Earth, 3I/ATLAS is set to continue on its trajectory, swinging past Jupiter in March 2026. This encounter is expected to slightly alter its path as it heads back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS has behaved exactly as a natural interstellar comet would, reinforcing our understanding of the universe's grand scale and Earth's place within it,” said Avi Loeb, a prominent astronomer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The flyby has provided a humbling reminder that the universe operates independently of human concerns,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS has sparked widespread interest and speculation, particularly online, where some theorised it could represent an alien probe. However, astronomers have consistently maintained that the object displayed no unusual behaviour, aligning with the characteristics of a typical comet. This event underscores a historical human tendency to seek meaning in cosmic occurrences, often reflecting a desire for connection with the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, astronomers will continue to analyse data collected from 3I/ATLAS. The comet's subsequent flyby of Jupiter in March 2026 will be closely monitored for any changes in its trajectory and behaviour as it returns to interstellar space.</p>
