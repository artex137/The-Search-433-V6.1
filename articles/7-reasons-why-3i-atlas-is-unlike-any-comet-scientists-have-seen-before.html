      <h2>7 reasons why 3I/ATLAS is unlike any comet scientists have seen before</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is a unique celestial object confirmed to come from outside our solar system, currently travelling at approximately 220,000 kilometres per hour. Scientists have noted its unusual composition and speed, marking it as a significant subject of study.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it provides a rare opportunity to learn about the origins of comets and the materials that exist in deep space. Researchers are actively studying 3I/ATLAS to uncover its secrets and understand its implications for cosmic science.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 220,000 km/h (137,000 mph)</li>
    <li><strong>Core Size:</strong> Less than 1 km wide</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Thick disk area of the Milky Way</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> High levels of carbon dioxide and nickel</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Bright coma visible from Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as a comet from outside the solar system. Scientists have since confirmed its trajectory and speed, noting its unique chemical makeup. Observations have revealed that it possesses a small solid core and a large coma, which contributes to its visibility.</p>

<p>The comet is currently on a path that will lead it to pass through our solar system only once, offering a fleeting opportunity for study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is unlike any comet we have encountered before, providing insights into the materials present in deep space,” said a leading astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, comets typically studied have originated from within our solar system. The study of this comet may lead to new understandings of comet formation and the evolution of celestial objects in different environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it travels through our solar system, gathering data to enhance our understanding of its origins and characteristics before it departs for the depths of space.</p>
