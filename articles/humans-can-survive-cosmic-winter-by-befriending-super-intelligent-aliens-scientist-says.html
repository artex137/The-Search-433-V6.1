      <h2>Humans can survive cosmic winter by befriending super intelligent aliens, scientist says</h2>

<p>Israeli-American physicist Avi Loeb has stated that humans could survive for trillions of years by befriending advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. Loeb made these remarks in a recent blog post, emphasizing the potential for human longevity in the cosmos. He argues that if humans encounter technologically superior aliens, it could lead to extended survival beyond the lifespan of stars. The statement follows his establishment of the Galileo Project, which aims to explore the existence of extraterrestrial technological civilizations.</p>

<p>This perspective is significant as it challenges the traditional views on extraterrestrial life and underscores the need for scientific inquiry into potential alien encounters. Loeb advocates for a shift in the scientific community's approach, suggesting that the existence of extraterrestrial life should not be dismissed due to social stigma. His assertions have gained attention amid ongoing discussions about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which he believes may be an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a Harvard professor known for his views on extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>The Galileo Project aims to investigate the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object approaching the inner solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will fly by Mars on October 3, 2025, and reach perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million km.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of 60,000 km/second.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, Avi Loeb has published various statements regarding the potential for human survival through contact with extraterrestrial life. He asserts that advanced alien civilizations could have technologies that allow them to create artificial stars, which could help humanity endure a future "cosmic winter." Loeb has also expressed his belief that 3I/ATLAS may not be a natural comet, citing its unusual trajectory and brightness.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2025, 3I/ATLAS is expected to fly by Mars, where it will be studied by multiple scientific instruments, including the CaSSIS camera on ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter and the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Finding extraterrestrial siblings would inspire us to reach out beyond the limited experiences we have had so far on our home planet. There are richer opportunities in our cosmic street than available at home."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb emphasized that "humans can no longer ignore the possible existence of Extraterrestrial Technological Civilisations (ETCs), and that science should not dogmatically reject potential extraterrestrial explanations because of social stigma or cultural preferences."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's claims come in the wake of increasing interest in the search for extraterrestrial life, particularly as technological advancements have made space exploration more feasible. The Galileo Project represents a significant push towards understanding potential alien civilizations and the implications of their existence for humanity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars, utilizing various imaging technologies to gather data. Future analyses may provide more insight into the object's nature and the potential for extraterrestrial life.</p>
