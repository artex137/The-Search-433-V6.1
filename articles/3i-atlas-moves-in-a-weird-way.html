      <h2>3I/ATLAS Moves in a Weird Way</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed unexpected acceleration, prompting scientific inquiry, as observed by the ALMA radio telescope array in Chile. The comet’s strange behavior has raised questions about its trajectory and the forces acting upon it.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges current understanding of cometary behavior and could suggest new phenomena in astrophysics. Over the coming months, various telescopes, including Hubble and James Webb, will monitor the comet closely for signs of gas and dust that might explain its acceleration.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Acceleration: Estimated at 0.02 thousandths of a metre per second squared</li>
    <li>Mass loss: Approximately 150 kilograms per second</li>
    <li>Monitoring telescopes: Hubble, James Webb, International Asteroid Warning Network</li>
    <li>Observation period: November 2025 to January 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2025, observations of 3I/ATLAS by the ALMA radio telescope revealed that it is not following its expected gravitational path. This unexpected acceleration has led to debates regarding its implications. In October 2025, researchers noted a significant mass loss, estimated at around 5.5 billion tonnes, although no corresponding gas cloud has been detected.</p>

<p>Previously, in 2017, another interstellar object, 1I/‘Oumuamua, exhibited similar acceleration without visible signs of gas or dust, leading to widespread speculation in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If by December we don’t see the predicted gas cloud, then we must consider the possibility of an artificial propulsion source,” said Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “For me, science isn’t decided by applause or television charisma,” Loeb added. “It’s decided by rigorous analysis of data. And the data, in this case, don’t quite fit our usual explanations.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon surrounding 3I/ATLAS echoes the puzzling behavior of 1I/‘Oumuamua, which also baffled scientists with its unexplained acceleration. This pattern of unusual cometary behavior raises questions about the limits of current astrophysical models and the need for new explanations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS through January 2026 to determine if the predicted gas cloud appears. The outcome will influence ongoing debates regarding the comet's nature and the forces acting upon it.</p>
