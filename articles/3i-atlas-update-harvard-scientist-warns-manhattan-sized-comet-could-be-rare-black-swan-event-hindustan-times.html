      <h2>3I/ATLAS raises alarms among scientists</h2>
<p>A mysterious interstellar object, known as 3I/ATLAS, has prompted concerns among scientists due to its unusual behavior. Discovered in July 2025, the object, nearly the size of Manhattan, has attracted the attention of NASA and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN). Earlier this week, IAWN launched an emergency probe to study 3I/ATLAS after it exhibited behaviors not seen before.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>This investigation is critical as Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has warned that 3I/ATLAS could represent a "black swan event," a rare occurrence with potentially significant consequences for humanity. NASA officials have stated that 3I/ATLAS does not pose an immediate threat, but the object will be closely monitored as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: Almost the size of Manhattan</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Monitoring agencies: NASA and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN)</li>
    <li>Emergency probe launched: Earlier this week</li>
    <li>Monitoring period: November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026</li>
    <li>Estimated weight: Up to 33 billion tons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025. Following its detection, scientists noted its strange behavior, prompting IAWN to launch an emergency defense probe to study the object earlier this week. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has expressed concerns regarding its potential implications for humanity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It’s at least a thousand times more massive than any other interstellar object we’ve seen,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The question is, why has such a giant object entered our solar system now?” Loeb added, emphasizing the significance of the object's arrival.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    NASA officials have stated that “3I/ATLAS poses no immediate threat,” but they will continue to monitor the situation closely.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The term “black swan event” refers to unpredictable occurrences with significant implications. Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS may not be a natural comet but could potentially be an artificial object, likening it to a “Trojan horse.” This comparison raises questions about the nature of the interstellar object and its origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>IAWN will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely until January 27, 2026. Observations will focus on the object's behavior as it approaches the Sun, with scientists hoping to determine whether it is a natural phenomenon or something more mysterious.</p>
