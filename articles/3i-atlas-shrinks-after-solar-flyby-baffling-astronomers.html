      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shrinks After Solar Flyby, Baffling Astronomers</h2>

<p>Astronomers are puzzled by the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has shrunk and partially disintegrated after its close pass by the Sun on 29 October 2025. The object, discovered on 1 July 2025, is the third of its kind ever detected and has not displayed typical cometary features, raising questions about its origin and structure.</p>

<p>The unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS matters because it challenges existing theories about cometary evolution. Researchers from NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and various observatories have begun to monitor the object closely for further changes as it moves toward its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July 2025 by ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li>Perihelion: 29 October 2025 at approximately 1.36 AU</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025 at around 1.8 AU</li>
    <li>Visible size reduction: 13% after solar encounter</li>
    <li>Active jets: At least seven detected</li>
    <li>Current trajectory: Hyperbolic escape trajectory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile. The object approached the Sun, reaching its closest point on 29 October 2025. Following this encounter, astronomers noted a significant reduction in its visible size and a lack of a typical cometary tail.</p>

<p>As it moves away from the Sun, 3I/ATLAS continues to exhibit peculiar characteristics, including at least seven active jets. These jets have prompted discussions about the object's potential origins and structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The strange evolution of 3I/ATLAS is unlike anything previously observed in space,” said a researcher at NASA, highlighting the object's baffling behaviour.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The phenomenon is beyond standard cometary models,” noted an astrophysicist, emphasizing the challenges faced in explaining its characteristics.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins a select group of interstellar visitors, including &#699;Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019). Its hyperbolic trajectory indicates it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun and will eventually exit the Solar System.</p>

<p>The object’s unusual composition, including a high CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O ratio, suggests it may have formed in an environment with strong cosmic radiation, further complicating the understanding of its nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to track 3I/ATLAS for changes in brightness and structure as it moves beyond the orbit of Mars. While some fragmentation is possible, no complete disintegration has been confirmed. Researchers are eager to learn more about this enigmatic interstellar visitor.</p>
