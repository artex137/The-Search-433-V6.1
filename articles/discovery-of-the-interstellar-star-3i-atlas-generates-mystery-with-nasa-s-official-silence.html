      <h2>Discovery of interstellar star 3I/ATLAS generates mystery with NASA’s official silence</h2>

<p>The interstellar star 3I/ATLAS has been detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The star exhibits an unusual chemical composition that challenges existing models of comet formation. As of now, there have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to the discovery.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the third known interstellar visitor to the Solar System. However, NASA has imposed restrictions on the release of detailed information regarding 3I/ATLAS since October, citing budget constraints due to the government shutdown in the United States. Astronomers from various countries have raised concerns about the lack of transparency, while independent observatories continue to gather data to address the gaps left by NASA.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Has an atypical chemical composition with high levels of carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>Confirmed to have a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>Passed close to Mars on October 3, 2025, allowing captures by orbital probes.</li>
    <li>Core measures between 300 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>Estimated age between 7.6 and 14 billion years.</li>
    <li>Projected to approach the Sun at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Speeds recorded between 210,000 and 221,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation since May 2025 when it activated at a distance of 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun. The star's activity continued until September, shining consistently. It passed close to Mars on October 3, allowing for data collection by various space probes.</p>

<p>NASA's Río Hurtado confirmed the object's hyperbolic orbit upon detection. Following this, collaborations with the European Space Agency have been established to fill data gaps left by NASA's restrictions.</p>

<p>As the object approaches perihelion on October 30, 2025, terrestrial observatories plan intensive observation sessions to capture potential dust ejections.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The potential of 3I/ATLAS to redefine our understanding of interstellar objects is immense,” said an astronomer involved in the ongoing research.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The urgency increases as the object moves away, requiring accelerated telemetry processing,” noted another researcher.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar visitors, which have raised questions about the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond the Solar System. Astronomers emphasize the importance of international collaboration in monitoring such objects, especially in light of NASA's budgetary limitations.</p>

<p>In recent years, the field of interstellar astronomy has gained traction, prompting discussions on planetary formation and chemical diversity in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As data collection continues, researchers expect the publication of high-resolution observations following perihelion. The integration of data from multiple missions will be crucial to advancing the understanding of 3I/ATLAS and its implications for galactic evolution.</p>
