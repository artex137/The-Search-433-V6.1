      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard's Avi Loeb Claims Alien Probe 'Unhappy' With Outcome of Humanity</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has suggested that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may be an alien surveillance probe, claiming it could be dissatisfied with humanity’s progress. Loeb made these comments during an interview with an Indian news channel, discussing the object’s unusual characteristics and its implications for Earth. The claims come as 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to the Sun, which occurred on <strong>October 29</strong>.</p>

<p>Loeb has raised significant questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, arguing that its behaviour deviates from that of typical comets. Authorities and scientists are now examining the object more closely, as its closest approach to Earth is scheduled for <strong>December 19, 2025</strong>.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Characteristics:</strong> Lack of a gaseous tail, signs of non-gravitational acceleration</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Object:</strong> Oumuamua</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed as it entered the solar system. On <strong>October 29, 2023</strong>, it reached its perihelion, where it was closely monitored by astronomers. During this period, its unusual behaviour sparked further speculation about its origins.</p>
<p>Leading up to its closest approach to Earth in <strong>December 2025</strong>, discussions about the object’s potential implications for humanity have intensified, particularly in the context of Loeb's theories.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They may monitor the solar system and they do it routinely,” Loeb said, discussing the potential intentions behind the object’s presence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The monitoring may be ongoing, and the observers may be disappointed by our current global behaviour,” he added, reflecting on humanity's challenges.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Loeb has stirred controversy within the scientific community. His previous assertion that the first-observed interstellar object, Oumuamua, was a piece of alien technology has drawn both support and criticism. The conversation surrounding 3I/ATLAS continues to challenge conventional views on extraterrestrial life and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to observe and analyze its behaviour. The upcoming close encounter is expected to provide further insights into the object and its potential origins, fueling ongoing debates in the scientific community.</p>
