      <h2>‘It’s never been cooler to be an alien contactee’: ET ‘experiencers’ are coming out as 3I/ATLAS phenomenon takes hold</h2>

<p>At approximately 7 p.m. on November 14, Catherine Chapey hosts a virtual meeting in Holtsville, Long Island. The gathering includes individuals who claim to have experienced close encounters with extraterrestrial life. Chapey, a former electrician and ordained “interspiritual minister,” has cultivated a community of “Experiencers” after her own otherworldly encounter. The group, once small, now boasts a mailing list of thousands, with participants joining from as far away as Japan and New Zealand.</p>

<p>The significance of this gathering lies in the recent surge of interest in UFO phenomena, particularly the 3I/ATLAS interstellar object. This object is currently passing through Earth’s atmosphere and has sparked discussions regarding extraterrestrial life. Authorities and scientists are examining its characteristics, which differ from typical comets, igniting public curiosity about alien encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> November 14, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Holtsville, Long Island</li>
    <li><strong>Number of participants:</strong> Thousands on the mailing list; attendees from Japan and New Zealand</li>
    <li><strong>Key topics:</strong> 3I/ATLAS, experiences of abduction and contact</li>
    <li><strong>Notable figures:</strong> Catherine Chapey, Kevin (realtor), Funda (medical worker), Nick (IT worker), Terry (retiree), Mel (mental health worker)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s, Catherine Chapey begins to experience otherworldly phenomena. These experiences lead her to seek out others with similar encounters.</p>
<p>In 2019, Chapey is ordained as an interspiritual minister, solidifying her commitment to supporting fellow experiencers.</p>
<p>On November 14, 2023, Chapey hosts a virtual meeting where participants discuss the implications of the 3I/ATLAS object and share personal experiences related to extraterrestrial contact.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This isn’t something you talk about with your family,” said Mary, a participant from New York's Finger Lakes region, reflecting on the stigma surrounding alien experiences.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When you go through something like [this], people drop out of your life,” Chapey explained. “They think you’re crazy, you’ve lost it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ongoing interest in UFOs has increased significantly in recent years. A YouGov poll indicated that belief in UFO sightings rose from 20 percent in 1996 to 34 percent in 2022. Reports of personal encounters with UFOs have also increased, with 24 percent of Americans claiming to have seen one.</p>
<p>Recent government disclosures regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) have contributed to this trend. The Department of Defense's 2020 release of footage showing fast-moving objects has heightened public interest and discussion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the nature of 3I/ATLAS continue, with scientists and researchers examining its trajectory and characteristics. The ongoing discussions in communities like Chapey’s suggest that the phenomenon will remain a focal point for both enthusiasts and skeptics alike.</p>
