      <h2>Strange interstellar object hurtling towards Earth has now grown a tail, astronomers say</h2>

<p>Astronomers have reported that Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object discovered on July 1, has developed a tail as it travels through the Solar System. The comet poses no threat to Earth, but it is expected to come close to Mars in the coming months.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the third known interstellar object to pass through the Solar System, following Comet 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Researchers are using this opportunity to study the comet’s composition and gather insights into the formation of solar systems around distant stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide.</li>
    <li>It is expected to pass close to Mars without posing a threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Observations have been conducted using the Gemini South telescope in the Chilean Andes.</li>
    <li>The comet is on a trajectory that will take it back into interstellar space.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers discovered Comet 3I/ATLAS as it entered the Solar System. Recent observations have revealed the development of a tail and a glowing coma, indicating its classification as a comet.</p>
<p>Researchers have utilized the Multi-Object Spectrograph instrument at the Gemini South telescope to analyze the wavelengths of light emitted by the comet. This data has provided insights into its chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The primary objectives of the observations were to look at the colours of the comet, which provide clues to the composition and sizes of the dust particles in the coma, and to take spectra for a direct measure of the chemistry,” said astronomer Karen Meech from the University of Hawai‘i Institute for Astronomy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We were excited to see the growth of the tail, suggesting a change in the particles from the previous Gemini images, and we got our first glimpse of the chemistry from the spectrum,” Dr Meech added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “These observations provide both a breathtaking view and critical scientific data. It reminds us that our Solar System is just one part of a vast and dynamic galaxy – and that even the most fleeting visitors can leave a lasting impact,” Dr Meech concluded.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of such objects offers valuable insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars, gathering more data to enhance our understanding of its composition and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
