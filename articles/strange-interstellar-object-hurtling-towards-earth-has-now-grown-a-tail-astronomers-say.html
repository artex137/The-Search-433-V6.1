      <h2>Strange interstellar object hurtling towards Earth has now grown a tail, astronomers say</h2>

<p>A new analysis of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shown that it is developing a tail, confirming its status as a comet. Discovered on July 1, 2023, 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System, following Comet 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this celestial event.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it offers researchers a rare opportunity to study the composition and behavior of a comet from another star system. Authorities, including astronomers at the University of Hawai‘i Institute for Astronomy, are utilizing advanced telescopes to gather data on the object while it is within reach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of discovery: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Size: Estimated to be no more than 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide</li>
    <li>Location of observations: Gemini South telescope in the Chilean Andes</li>
    <li>Current trajectory: Will return to interstellar space</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023. Observations made using the Gemini South telescope have revealed the growth of a tail and a glowing coma around the comet. These changes indicate that the object is undergoing significant transformations as it approaches the Sun.</p>
<p>The latest findings were announced following detailed imaging and spectral analysis conducted by astronomers, who have noted the comet's composition and its similarities to Solar System comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The primary objectives of the observations were to look at the colours of the comet, which provide clues to the composition and sizes of the dust particles in the coma, and to take spectra for a direct measure of the chemistry,” said astronomer Karen Meech from the University of Hawai‘i Institute for Astronomy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We were excited to see the growth of the tail, suggesting a change in the particles from the previous Gemini images, and we got our first glimpse of the chemistry from the spectrum,” Dr. Meech added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “These observations provide both a breathtaking view and critical scientific data,” Dr. Meech stated. “It reminds us that our Solar System is just one part of a vast and dynamic galaxy – and that even the most fleeting visitors can leave a lasting impact.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed to pass through the Solar System. The previous two, Comet 1I/ʻOumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the nature of celestial bodies from outside our system. The study of such objects can enhance our understanding of the formation of solar systems around other stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System. They aim to gather additional data on its composition and behavior before it exits back into interstellar space.</p>
