      <h2>The Race to Study an Interstellar Comet from Deep Space</h2>

<p>Astronomers are rapidly mobilizing to study interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. The comet was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This study is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system. NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft have already begun observing the comet from Mars and will continue to do so as it travels toward Jupiter. Scientists hope to gather valuable data on the comet's composition and origins, as understanding such objects can provide insights into the formation of celestial bodies across the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at approximately 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion, the closest point to the sun, on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently over 125 million miles from the sun.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object after 1I/‘Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope detected Comet 3I/ATLAS while it was over 400 million miles away from the sun. By October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, positioned nearly 125 million miles from the sun. During this time, NASA and ESA spacecraft began observations from Mars, and further Jupiter-bound missions are planned.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Each one of these has been special and precious, and everybody drops everything to look at them,” says Karen Meech, a planetary astronomer at the University of Hawaii.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Now we have three interstellar visitors, and it looks like each of them has a different story to tell,” says Quanzhi Ye, a planetary astronomer at the University of Maryland and Boston University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS joins the ranks of previous interstellar objects, 1I/‘Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, and Comet 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019. The study of these objects is crucial for understanding the differences and similarities between interstellar comets and those formed within our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, gathering data on its composition and behavior. This ongoing observation is expected to provide further insights into the characteristics of interstellar comets.</p>
