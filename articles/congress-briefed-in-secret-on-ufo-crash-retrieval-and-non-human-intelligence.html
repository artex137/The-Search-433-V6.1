      <h2>Congress Briefed in Secret on UFO Crash Retrieval and Non-Human Intelligence</h2>

<p>A scientist who has consulted for the Pentagon on UFO programs has briefed Congress about recovered extraterrestrial technology in secure rooms, according to Dr. Eric Davis. The briefings, which took place in various settings from October 2019 to May 2023, included sensitive information about UFO crash retrievals and Non-Human Intelligence programs.</p>

<p>These disclosures highlight the U.S. government's ongoing interest in UFO phenomena as a matter of national security. Davis has emphasized that the information he shared is tightly controlled, with full public disclosure requiring executive permission.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dr. Eric Davis has briefed congressional committees in secure settings since October 2019.</li>
    <li>Briefings included information on UFO crash retrievals and reverse-engineering efforts.</li>
    <li>Most recent briefing occurred in May 2023 before Representative Marcos Luna's committee.</li>
    <li>Disclosure is limited by strict Non-Disclosure Agreements related to national security.</li>
    <li>Programs involve recovery of materials and potential biological specimens from off-world vehicles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2019, Dr. Davis briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee staff in a Pentagon Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). He also briefed the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in a controlled environment that same month. In June 2021, he provided information in a secure access facility of a defense company. The most recent briefing occurred in May 2023, when he presented to a committee chaired by Representative Marcos Luna.</p>

<p>Throughout these briefings, Davis has described historical crash retrievals and reverse-engineering efforts aimed at understanding technology not made on Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What I disclosed to congressional staff represents the most accurate picture of ongoing research in this secretive field,” Davis said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Full public disclosure is impossible without executive permission,” he added, noting that the President could waive NDAs to allow sharing of information.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The briefings reflect a longstanding U.S. government initiative to study UFO phenomena as a national security concern. Previous incidents and reports have suggested that the government has engaged in extensive efforts to catalogue and understand technologies beyond current human capabilities.</p>

<p>While public hearings often present a fragmented view, these briefings indicate that select congressional staff have received detailed and potentially transformative information about UFOs and Non-Human Intelligence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future investigations may depend on executive decisions regarding the release of classified information. The potential for broader public disclosure remains uncertain, but ongoing discussions in Congress could influence the direction of these efforts.</p>
