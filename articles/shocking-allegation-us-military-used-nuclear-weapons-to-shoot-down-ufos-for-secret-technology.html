      <h2>Shocking allegation: US military used nuclear weapons to shoot down UFOs for secret technology</h2>

<p>The US military and other powerful states are suspected of using nuclear weapons to shoot down unidentified flying objects (UFOs) to obtain their alleged technology, according to filmmaker Dan Farah. Farah made these claims during an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, where he discussed information gathered over four years from high-level US government and military officials involved in UFO recovery.</p>

<p>These allegations highlight concerns about potential nuclear conflict and the implications of interacting with extraterrestrial life. Authorities have not confirmed the existence of such technology or incidents, and the US government maintains that there is "no verifiable evidence" of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Claims made by filmmaker Dan Farah during Joe Rogan's podcast.</li>
    <li>Farah has interviewed US government and military officials for four years.</li>
    <li>The US conducted over 1,000 nuclear tests from 1945 to 1992, some at altitudes over 50 km.</li>
    <li>Farah's film "The Age of Disclosure" documents a purported 80-year cover-up of alien existence.</li>
    <li>Congressman Tim Burchett has mentioned "underwater UFO bases" but provided no evidence.</li>
    <li>Allegations suggest a new "Cold War" among the US, Russia, and China regarding non-human technology.</li>
    <li>Claims of President Donald Trump requesting further investigations into these allegations, but no official confirmation exists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>From 1945 to 1992, the US conducted over 1,000 nuclear tests, including some at high altitudes and underwater during the Cold War. In recent years, reports of increased UFO sightings have coincided with these nuclear tests, according to Farah. The allegations have gained attention following Farah's interviews with military officials and statements from politicians like Congressman Tim Burchett.</p>

<p>In his film, "The Age of Disclosure," Farah argues that there has been a significant global cover-up regarding the existence of aliens and their technology, spanning approximately 80 years. The discussion of these claims has intensified in the context of current geopolitical tensions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This practice is shocking, as it risks nuclear conflict or confrontation with a more intelligent species,” said Dan Farah during the podcast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There is no verifiable evidence” of extraterrestrial life or the recovery of their ships, according to the US government.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, the US has engaged in numerous nuclear tests, some of which have been linked to increased UFO sightings. The Cold War era saw heightened military activity, with both the US and the Soviet Union exploring advanced technologies. Recent discussions around UFOs have reignited interest in governmental transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into Farah's claims are ongoing, with no official confirmation of President Trump's alleged request for further inquiries. The implications of these allegations continue to raise questions about national security and the potential for international conflict.</p>
