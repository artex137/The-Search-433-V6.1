      <h2>Scientist Identifies Something Strange About New Image of Mysterious Interstellar Visitor</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS, taken by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in early October. The images show the comet, described as a “fuzzy white ball” by NASA associate administrator Amit Kshatriya, as it travels approximately 19 million miles from Earth, illuminated by the Sun.</p>

<p>This release marks the closest look at 3I/ATLAS to date and has sparked renewed interest among astronomers. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has raised questions about the jets emitted from the object, suggesting they may not conform to typical comet behavior. NASA has maintained that the evidence supports the conclusion that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, though it is noted to be an unusual one.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA released images of 3I/ATLAS on [specific date not disclosed].</li>
    <li>The images were taken by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 19 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>Resolution of the images is about 19 miles per pixel.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS as it passed by Mars. These images were released by NASA officials earlier this week. The images provided a detailed view of the comet's coma, a cloud of dust and ice, as it traveled through space.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has expressed concerns about the direction of jets emanating from the comet, indicating they may not align with typical comet behavior. He has suggested that these features could imply an artificial origin, though NASA has countered this theory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"It is easy to explain a plume of gas and dust extended towards the Sun as a result of the illumination of pockets of ice by sunlight or away from the Sun as a result of radiation pressure or the solar wind," said Loeb in a blog post.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The overwhelming evidence points to it being a natural comet," said Kshatriya during the announcement livestream.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of interstellar objects has become increasingly common as advancements in technology allow for better tracking and imaging capabilities. 3I/ATLAS is one of several interstellar visitors that have been detected, raising questions about their origins and nature.</p>

<p>While many scientists accept that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, Loeb's theories introduce an element of speculation regarding the potential for extraterrestrial technology. This has led to a divide in the scientific community regarding the interpretation of the comet's features.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023. Astronomers plan to observe the comet with ground- and space-based telescopes to analyze the jets further and determine their composition, speed, and mass loading rate.</p>
