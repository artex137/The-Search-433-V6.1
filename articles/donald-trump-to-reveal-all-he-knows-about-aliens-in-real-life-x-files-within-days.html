      <h2>Donald Trump to 'reveal all he knows' about aliens in real life X-Files 'within days'</h2>

<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced plans to disclose what he claims to know about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in a presentation expected within days. The announcement comes amid increased public interest in government disclosures regarding UFOs.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it coincides with ongoing discussions about transparency in government regarding extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including military officials, have been urged to provide more information on UFO sightings and encounters, which has raised questions about national security and public safety.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>Expected disclosure within days, specific date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Focus on UFOs and potential extraterrestrial encounters.</li>
    <li>Increased public interest in UFO investigations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been a marked increase in UFO sightings and reports, particularly from military personnel. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force to investigate these incidents. Trump's announcement follows a series of government reports on UFOs that have reignited public curiosity.</p>

<p>Details surrounding Trump's claims have not been disclosed, but he has positioned himself as a key figure in the conversation about UFO transparency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I will reveal all I know about UFOs and what the government has kept from the public.”</blockquote> 

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This announcement comes at a time when the U.S. government is facing pressure to release more information regarding UFOs. In June 2021, a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence outlined several unexplained aerial phenomena, leading to calls for greater transparency.</p>

<p>Previous administrations have been criticized for their lack of disclosure on UFO-related matters, contributing to a growing public interest in the subject.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Trump's forthcoming presentation is expected to draw significant media attention. It remains to be seen how this will impact ongoing discussions about UFO transparency and government accountability.</p>
