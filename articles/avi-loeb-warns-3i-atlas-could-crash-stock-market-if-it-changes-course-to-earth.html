      <h2>Avi Loeb Warns 3I/ATLAS Could Crash Stock Market If It Changes Course to Earth</h2>

<p>As of October 30, 2025, Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has warned that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could trigger a global stock market crash if it alters its trajectory towards Earth. The object, currently obscured by the sun after its closest approach on October 29, has prompted concerns about its potential implications for humanity.</p>

<p>Authorities are monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely as it passes through our solar system. Loeb has characterized this moment as a "blind date with a cosmic visitor," emphasizing that any change in the object's path could indicate it is under intelligent control, presenting significant risks. He has called the situation a "black swan event" that could have enormous consequences if not properly understood.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Current date: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated size of 3I/ATLAS: 20 to 46 kilometres wide</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars during closest approach: 29 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Composition of gas plume: 95% carbon dioxide, 5% water</li>
    <li>Data sources: SPHEREx space observatory, Hubble telescope, Very Large Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, 3I/ATLAS passed within 29 million kilometres of Mars, allowing for close observation by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Dr. Loeb noted this event demonstrated a "remarkable fine-tuning" of the object's trajectory.</p>

<p>On October 29, the object reached its closest approach to the sun, becoming obscured from view. Dr. Loeb has stated that the world is now waiting for the object to emerge from the sun's glare, which could reveal its true path.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it appears on a different path, we have some risk involved,” Dr. Avi Loeb said in a recent interview. “Even if the risk is small, the consequences would be huge.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb labelled 3I/ATLAS a “black swan event that we haven't anticipated,” stressing the need for vigilance as the world awaits its re-emergence.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Dr. Loeb's concerns arise from a series of anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS that challenge traditional comet characteristics. Notably, the object is venting nickel gas without the presence of iron, a combination only known to exist in man-made nickel alloys. The unusual chemistry and trajectory have led to increased scrutiny from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, astronomers continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for any changes in its trajectory. The world awaits further observations that could help clarify the nature of this unusual interstellar object.</p>
