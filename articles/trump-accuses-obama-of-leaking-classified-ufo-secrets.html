      <h2>Trump accuses Obama of leaking classified UFO secrets</h2>

<p>U.S. President Donald Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of disclosing “classified” information regarding extraterrestrial life during a podcast interview released last week. Trump made the remarks on Thursday, following Obama’s comments on the podcast hosted by Brian Tyler Cohen, which included statements about the existence of aliens.</p>

<p>This controversy has sparked renewed interest in discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the government's handling of such reports. Authorities have not disclosed any specific actions they will take in response to Trump’s allegations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump made his comments on October 26, 2023.</li>
    <li>Obama's podcast interview was released on October 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Obama served as U.S. President from 2009 to 2017.</li>
    <li>Trump is currently 79 years old.</li>
    <li>Obama clarified his remarks on Instagram following the backlash.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 19, 2023, Barack Obama participated in a podcast where he discussed the existence of extraterrestrial life, stating, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them.” This statement ignited discussions online. In response, Obama later clarified his position on Instagram, emphasizing the vastness of the universe and the low probability of alien visitation.</p>

<p>On October 26, 2023, Donald Trump addressed the media, accusing Obama of leaking classified information without specifying the details. Trump expressed uncertainty about the existence of aliens but criticized Obama for his remarks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He gave classified information, he is not supposed to be doing that,” Trump told reporters, referring to Obama’s comments.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” Obama clarified on Instagram.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UFOs, now referred to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), has gained traction in recent years, especially as the U.S. government investigates numerous reports of unusual aircraft. A Pentagon report released in March 2024 stated that there is no proof that UAP are alien technology, with many sightings identified as weather balloons, spy planes, or satellites.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not announced any investigations or actions following Trump’s statements. The discussion around UFOs and government transparency is likely to continue as public interest remains high.</p>
