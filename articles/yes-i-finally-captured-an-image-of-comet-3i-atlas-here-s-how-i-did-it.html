      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Captured from Kendal, UK</h2>
<p>On 16 November 2025, an amateur astronomer successfully captured images of Comet 3I/ATLAS using a Seestar S50 smart telescope in Kendal, Cumbria, UK. The comet, discovered on 1 July 2025 by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System.</p>

<p>This event marks a significant milestone for amateur astronomy. The comet's visibility to small telescopes and potentially less advanced cameras opens opportunities for more enthusiasts to observe and document this interstellar visitor. Over the coming week, as the comet rises higher in the sky and the Moon wanes, observers in the northern hemisphere may have a rare chance to see it.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of discovery: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Date of imaging: 16 November 2025</li>
    <li>Location of imaging: Kendal, Cumbria, UK</li>
    <li>Telescope used: Seestar S50</li>
    <li>Brightness: Shining brighter than 10th magnitude</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope. Following its discovery, the comet remained visible primarily through large telescopes and sophisticated equipment. On 16 November 2025, an amateur astronomer in Kendal, UK, managed to capture images of the comet using a smart telescope.</p>
<p>The imaging took place early in the morning, starting around 5 a.m., under challenging conditions due to light pollution from streetlights and the proximity of the waning crescent Moon. The astronomer reported difficulties in capturing clear images due to these factors.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While they were fast asleep in their beds that morning, my 'toy' was taking images of a comet that was born billions of years ago in the light of an alien sun,” the astronomer stated, reflecting on the significance of the capture.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is noteworthy as the third interstellar object confirmed within our Solar System. Interstellar comets present unique opportunities for scientific study, providing insights into the materials and conditions that existed in other star systems. The increased visibility of such comets to amateur astronomers could lead to more public engagement in astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<pAs Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, amateur astronomers are encouraged to observe and capture images of the comet. The upcoming week presents optimal viewing conditions as the comet rises higher in the sky. Observers are invited to share their images, which may be featured in future publications.</p>
