      <h2>NASA Mission To Jupiter Snapped Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper has captured observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on November 6, 2023, as it continues its journey away from the Solar System. The comet was approximately 164 million kilometers from the spacecraft at the time of the observation.</p>

<p>The findings from this mission are significant for understanding the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. The Europa Clipper team is analyzing the data collected by the Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph (Europa-UVS) to gain insights into the comet's gases and structure.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed on November 6, 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun during observation: 203 million kilometers (126 million miles).</li>
    <li>Distance from Europa Clipper: 164 million kilometers (102 million miles).</li>
    <li>Instrument used: Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph (Europa-UVS).</li>
    <li>Principal Investigator: Dr. Kurt Retherford from the Southwest Research Institute.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 6, 2023, NASA's Europa Clipper observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The observations followed the comet's perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, which occurred just days earlier. The team utilized the Europa-UVS to analyze the comet's composition.</p>

<p>In mid-October, models indicated that the Europa Clipper would be well-positioned to study the comet's ion and dust tails after perihelion. The observations confirmed the expected location of these tails, although some aspects remain unclear.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We're excited to see the gases that are escaping from the comet, hydrogen and oxygen atoms for sure. Maybe we'll get some detections or limits on carbon as well, from like the dry ice in the comet,”</blockquote>
<p>— Dr. Kurt Retherford, Principal Investigator of Europa-UVS.</p>

<blockquote>“Everything we're seeing is really consistent with an active comet being active after its perihelion passage,”</blockquote>
<p>— Dr. Kurt Retherford, Principal Investigator of Europa-UVS.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation is part of ongoing research into interstellar comets, which provide valuable information about the early solar system and the materials that exist beyond it. Previous missions have also studied similar objects, contributing to a growing understanding of their characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Europa Clipper team will continue to analyze the data collected from comet 3I/ATLAS. The full results are expected to be available in a few months, as scientists work to interpret the findings and refine their models of the comet's behavior.</p>
