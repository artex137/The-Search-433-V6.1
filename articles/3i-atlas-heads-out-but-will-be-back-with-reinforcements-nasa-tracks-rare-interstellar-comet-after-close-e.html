      <h2>3I/ATLAS Heads Out but Will Be Back with Reinforcements? NASA Tracks Rare Interstellar Comet After Close Encounter</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth at 1 a.m. EST on December 19, coming within 270 million kilometers. The comet is the third known visitor from outside the solar system, and no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The close pass of 3I/ATLAS has allowed scientists to gather important data that could enhance understanding of planetary and comet formation around other stars. As the comet moves away, researchers continue to analyze its unusual brightness and ancient origin, which are raising new questions about its characteristics and potential significance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19 at 1 a.m. EST</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 270 million kilometers (168 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> Up to 7 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Visitors:</strong> 1I/‘Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) first detected 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025. Early observations indicated that its trajectory could not be explained by solar system gravity alone, confirming its interstellar origin. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, allowing for detailed observations.</p>
<p>Following this close encounter, the comet began its journey towards the outer solar system and will eventually exit the solar system entirely, marking the final opportunity for direct study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The scientific impact of 3I/ATLAS is only beginning,” said Matthew Hopkins, an astronomer at the University of Oxford. “Statistical analysis shows it is likely the oldest comet ever observed.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins a short list of known interstellar objects, including 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These objects provide unique insight into materials from other star systems, with scientists believing such comets may contain raw materials from early planetary systems. The thick disk of stars from which 3I/ATLAS originates is estimated to be several billion years older than the thin disk where the sun is located.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers continue to analyze data collected during the comet’s passage. The findings will contribute to improved models of star system formation, and NASA has made tracking the comet's path available to the public through the Eyes on the Solar System interactive app.</p>
