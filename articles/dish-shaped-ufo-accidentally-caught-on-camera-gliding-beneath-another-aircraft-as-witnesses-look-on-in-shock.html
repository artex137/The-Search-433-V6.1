      <h2>'Dish-shaped' UFO sighting reported in Oshkosh, Wisconsin</h2>

<p>A pair of factory workers has reported capturing footage of a dish-shaped UFO gliding across the sky in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, on November 4. Alex Ramage, 33, and Andrei Volk, 38, were filming a plane to test the zoom on a phone's camera when they noticed the object. There were no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This sighting adds to a growing number of UFO reports, prompting discussions about the implications of such encounters. Authorities and researchers are increasingly examining these claims as potential national security concerns.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: November 4, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Oshkosh, Wisconsin</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Alex Ramage and Andrei Volk</li>
    <li>Object description: Dish-shaped, gliding motion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 4, 2023, Ramage and Volk filmed a plane during their work break at a factory in Oshkosh. While reviewing the footage, they discovered an unusual oval object moving across the sky. They described the object as appearing to glide, distinctly different from a conventional aircraft.</p>
<p>After viewing the footage, the witnesses expressed disbelief and wonder, with Ramage stating that he has always believed in UFOs but never expected to experience such an event firsthand.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “To me it looks like you can make out a dome shape in the middle of the disk, like a traditional UFO people imagine,” said Alex Ramage. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We were in shock and awe because I’ve always believed in UFOs but to experience it for myself is amazing,” he added. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Recent years have seen a rise in UFO sightings and discussions surrounding them. Incidents like the sighting at Disneyland, where parkgoers witnessed a black ring in the sky, have contributed to public interest and concern. In response, the U.S. government has acknowledged the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena and established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate such reports.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Pentagon has released extensive documents related to UFO investigations, revealing a shift in how these phenomena are perceived by officials and the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any immediate plans for investigation regarding the sighting in Oshkosh. However, as UFO reports continue to emerge, it is likely that interest from both the public and government officials will persist.</p>
