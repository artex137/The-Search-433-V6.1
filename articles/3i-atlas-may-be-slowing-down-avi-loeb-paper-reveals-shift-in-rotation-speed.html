      <h2>3I/ATLAS May Be Slowing Down, Avi Loeb Paper Reveals Shift in Rotation Speed</h2>

<p>A recent study by astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be experiencing a slowdown in its rotation speed. The findings indicate that the object's rotation period decreased from 16.16 hours in July to 15.48 hours in August, marking a 4% reduction prior to its closest approach to the sun. This observation has sparked increased scrutiny and speculation about the comet's characteristics.</p>

<p>The implications of this research are significant as they could provide insights into the composition and origin of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities and scientists are now focused on further observations and data collection to understand the comet's behavior and the validity of the claims made regarding its rotation. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rotation period dropped from 16.16 hours in July to 15.48 hours in August.</li>
    <li>This represents a 4% slowdown over a few weeks.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>The study discusses the first detection of a jet wobble in the comet.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb's study is titled "A 14th Anomaly of 3I/ATLAS."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July, observations indicated that 3I/ATLAS had a rotation period of 16.16 hours based on brightness changes. By August, the rotation period was recorded at 15.48 hours, attributed to the modeling of the comet’s jet wobble. The discrepancy of 0.68 hours between these two figures has led to discussions about the possibility of the comet slowing down.</p>

<p>On December 19, 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to Earth, which is anticipated to provide further data about the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interesting video, but the claimed 'slowdown' isn't supported by the data,” said Geeta, an X user. “The large ±0.70 hour uncertainty on the second measurement fully overlaps with the precise July value.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study by Avi Loeb marks a significant moment in the study of interstellar objects. The detection of the wobble alongside the rotation period has never been observed in a body from another solar system before. However, there are mixed opinions regarding the interpretation of the data.</p>

<p>Some experts argue that the reported slowdown may not be statistically significant due to the large margin of error associated with the August measurement.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further observations are needed to clarify the implications of the rotation speed findings and to determine if the object is indeed slowing down as suggested.</p>
