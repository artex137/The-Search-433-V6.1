      <h2>Letters to Harvard professor Avi Loeb reflect a new generation’s global fascination with 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has received a surge of letters from individuals worldwide expressing their interest in the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. The correspondence highlights a growing fascination with astronomy and the scientific implications of Loeb's work since the discovery of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides an opportunity for public engagement with science, according to Loeb. He describes the object as "a gift from interstellar space" that can inspire future generations to explore scientific careers. Loeb emphasizes the potential for extended observation of 3I/ATLAS, which is currently positioned near the ecliptic plane, allowing for detailed study through telescopes and cameras on planetary orbiters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object discovered in 2023.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a professor at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>Loeb has identified 10 anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb has received numerous letters expressing interest in his work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2023, sparking scientific curiosity and public engagement. Following the discovery, Avi Loeb began receiving letters from individuals around the world expressing their fascination with the object. Loeb has identified multiple anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, leading to discussions about its potential as an "extraterrestrial technological product."</p>
<p>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth is anticipated to occur on December 19, 2025, when further data may be collected to better understand the object's nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“In science we are often intrigued by anomalies that are inconsistent with past paradigms. As a result, we bring forward possible theoretical interpretations which motivate the collection of new data.”</blockquote>
<p>- Avi Loeb</p>

<blockquote>“Every day you inspire a lot of people including me and my kids. I watched all your interviews on YouTube and I love the way you explain things.”</blockquote>
<p>- Charlotte Hugues, Mérida, Mexico</p>

<blockquote>“I believe that, in the case of 3I/ATLAS, your interpretation may turn out to be correct or incorrect — science must always allow room for both possibilities.”</blockquote>
<p>- Dr. Gouk Tae Kim, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The letters received by Loeb reflect a broader trend of public interest in space exploration and interstellar research, particularly following the discovery of unique astronomical objects like 3I/ATLAS. Loeb's previous work on ʻOumuamua has also contributed to his recognition and the curiosity surrounding his current research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb plans to continue his research on 3I/ATLAS and expects to gather more data during its closest approach to Earth in December 2025. Further analysis of the object could provide insights into its composition and origins.</p>
