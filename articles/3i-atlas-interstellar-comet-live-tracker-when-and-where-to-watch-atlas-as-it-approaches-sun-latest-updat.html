      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet Approaches Sun</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to the Sun around October 30, 2025, reaching perihelion at approximately 11:47 UT, according to NASA. The comet will pass just inside Mars’ orbit, at a distance of about 130 million miles from the Sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object detected in our solar system. Astronomers worldwide are observing the comet as it travels on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun and will exit the solar system permanently after its visit.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025, at approximately 11:47 UT</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> About 130 million miles (1.36 astronomical units)</li>
    <li><strong>First discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth in December:</strong> Approximately 167 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Expected to be visible again around November 11, 2025, requiring large telescopes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Observations indicate that the comet has been tracked as far back as June 14, 2025. As it approaches the Sun, astronomers have recorded significant activity, including the release of dust and gas as its icy surface heats up.</p>
<p>NASA and ESA's Hubble Telescope have captured images of the comet, while the James Webb Telescope has detected compounds such as carbon dioxide and water. The comet will not come closer than 170 million miles to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object ever detected passing through our solar system,” NASA stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of atomic nickel vapor in 3I/ATLAS has puzzled scientists, as solid metals like nickel typically do not turn into gas at low temperatures. This unusual finding may suggest that nickel is bonding with carbon monoxide or other organic compounds, facilitating its vaporization.</p>
<p>NASA and ESA have ruled out sending a spacecraft to study the comet due to its high speed and short approach window, opting instead to utilize telescopes for analysis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition using available telescopes. Observations will focus on the comet's dust and gas emissions to gain further insights into its characteristics.</p>
