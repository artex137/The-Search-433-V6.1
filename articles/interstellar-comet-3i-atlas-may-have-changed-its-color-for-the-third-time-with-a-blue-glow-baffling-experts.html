      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS May Have Changed Its Color For The Third Time With A Blue Glow Baffling Experts</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed a third color change in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has recently exhibited a blue glow. The comet, first discovered by the ATLAS observatory in Chile in July 2025, reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, and has prompted widespread curiosity and speculation among astronomers and the public alike.</p>

<p>The significance of this discovery lies in the unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS, which has shifted colors from red to green and now blue. Researchers, including Professor Avi Loeb from Harvard, have noted that this color change could be attributed to the comet releasing carbon monoxide or ammonia. The blue tint has been labeled the ninth anomaly, highlighting the need for further investigation into the comet's properties and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
<li>It reached perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
<li>The comet has changed colors from red to green and now blue.</li>
<li>It is emitting about 150 kilograms of gas and dust every second.</li>
<li>The closest flyby to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</li>
<li>Observations are being conducted by the ALMA Observatory and other global institutions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers at the ATLAS observatory in Chile first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Initially, the comet displayed a red tint, likely due to sunlight reflecting off dust particles. By September 2025, it shifted to a green hue, attributed to the presence of molecules such as cyanide or dicarbon. Following its perihelion on October 30, 2025, the comet was observed to emit a blue glow, which researchers believe is linked to the release of carbon monoxide or ammonia.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches Earth, it is expected to provide researchers with new insights during its closest flyby on December 19, 2025. This event will allow for enhanced observations from various space-based telescopes and probes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Scientists are observing the object 3I/ATLAS with our observatory. The data from these observations will not have a proprietary period, so once their quality is verified, they will be publicly available in the ALMA Archive.” — ALMA Observatory</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. Its unusual color changes and behavior have sparked a range of theories among scientists and the public. Speculation has included ideas that the comet could be a piece of alien technology or a dark matter relic. Despite these claims, researchers emphasize the need for rigorous scientific analysis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest flyby, astronomers will continue to monitor its behavior and characteristics. The upcoming observations are expected to provide critical data that could enhance understanding of this interstellar visitor and its unique properties.</p>
