      <h2>Terrifying update on mysterious object aiming at Earth that Harvard scientist claims is 'not natural'</h2>

<p>A massive rock, designated 3I/ATLAS, is currently traveling through space towards Earth, having been detected on July 1. The object, which is roughly the size of Manhattan, is behaving unusually, prompting scientists to investigate its nature and trajectory.</p>

<p>This discovery raises significant questions within the scientific community. Authorities, including the International Asteroid Warning Network, have added 3I/ATLAS to their monitoring list. While they assert it poses no threat, they acknowledge its potential for scientific observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object detected on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Size comparable to Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Reportedly shows unusual behavior for a comet.</li>
    <li>Contains a tail composed of carbon dioxide, water, cyanide, and a nickel alloy.</li>
    <li>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has raised concerns about its origins.</li>
    <li>Loeb assigns a 30 to 40 per cent likelihood that it is not a natural object.</li>
    <li>International Asteroid Warning Network is monitoring it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023. Since its discovery, scientists have been puzzled by its behavior. Avi Loeb published a paper discussing the object’s unusual characteristics, including its lack of a traditional comet tail. Recent images from Spain’s Nordic Optical Telescope revealed a tail, which has led to further speculation about the object’s nature.</p>

<p>Loeb has suggested that the tail might be a result of a 'braking thrust' maneuver, indicating controlled movement. He has introduced a 'Loeb Scale' to assess interstellar objects, placing 3I/ATLAS at a 6, suggesting a significant possibility of technological origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “There were claims of a tail... But since 3I/ATLAS is accelerating and its current size is not much larger than the angular resolution of Earth-based telescopes, it is not easy to avoid fictitious elongation of the image as a result of the object's motion,” said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Currently, I give 3I/ATLAS a 6 on that scale, but my assessment will change as we get better data on it when it comes closer to the Sun,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is not the first object to raise eyebrows among scientists. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua,' have also prompted discussions about their origins and behaviors. The scientific community continues to monitor such objects for potential insights into the nature of space and the possibility of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists will gather more data to further assess its characteristics. The International Asteroid Warning Network will continue to monitor the object for any changes in trajectory or behavior.</p>
