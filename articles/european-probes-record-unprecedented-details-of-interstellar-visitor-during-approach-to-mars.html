      <h2>European probes record unprecedented details of interstellar visitor during approach to Mars</h2>

<p>Agência Espacial Europeia has confirmed the capture of detailed data about the celestial body 3I/ATLAS during its approach to Mars on October 2025. The comet, identified as the third object from another star system to cross the solar system, passed approximately 30 million kilometers from the Red Planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides scientists with unique insights into the formation of interstellar objects. Authorities have coordinated a global monitoring network, utilizing ground-based and space-based telescopes to analyze the comet's activity and structure.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Travel speed:</strong> Approximately 250,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Core diameter:</strong> Estimated between 300 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum distance from Earth:</strong> 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> End of October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Orbital eccentricity:</strong> Greater than 6</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the inner solar system from the direction of the Sagitário constellation. The comet reached perihelion at the end of October 2025, passing between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, approximately 210 million kilometers from the Sun. Observations were conducted by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and supported by data from the Mars Express mission, which refined spectral measurements during the closest approach period.</p>

<p>As the comet neared perihelion, a significant change in the color of its coma was observed, evolving from reddish to bluish tones. This was reported by the Telescópio Espacial James Webb.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The gaseous activity of 3I/ATLAS has proven more intense than that observed in previous visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua,” said a spokesperson from the Agência Espacial Europeia.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event follows a series of observations of interstellar objects, providing essential data for refining theoretical models on sublimation in comets and the distribution of matter between stellar systems. The monitoring of 3I/ATLAS has mobilized a global network of telescopes, highlighting the importance of international collaboration in space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Attention will turn to the comet's gravitational interaction with Jupiter, scheduled for March 2026, which will be monitored by the Juno probe. Data collected from the Europa Clipper and Hera missions will continue to be processed to enhance understanding of interstellar materials.</p>
