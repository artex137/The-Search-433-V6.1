      <h2>Commercial pilot who narrowly escaped UFO mothership had his story buried by the CIA for 30 years</h2>

<p>A commercial pilot has claimed he narrowly escaped a UFO mothership during an incident that reportedly occurred over 30 years ago. The pilot, whose identity has not been disclosed, described the encounter as life-changing, yet his account has remained largely unreported until now.</p>

<p>This revelation has prompted renewed interest in government transparency regarding UFO sightings. The CIA has faced scrutiny for allegedly suppressing information about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) for decades. Authorities are now under pressure to disclose more details regarding past incidents and their investigations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred over 30 years ago.</li>
    <li>The identity of the pilot has not been disclosed.</li>
    <li>The CIA is accused of burying the pilot's story.</li>
    <li>Renewed scrutiny on government transparency regarding UFOs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The pilot reported the encounter with the UFO mothership during a flight. Details surrounding the exact date and location of the incident remain undisclosed. Following the event, the pilot stated he faced difficulties in sharing his experience due to perceived government suppression.</p>

<p>In recent years, interest in UAP has surged, leading to calls for government accountability. Investigative efforts have increased since the release of several reports on UFO sightings by military personnel.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This incident highlights the need for more transparency and accountability from government agencies,” said a spokesperson for a UFO advocacy group.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The pilot's experience is not an isolated case. Numerous sightings of UFOs have been reported over the decades, often dismissed or classified by government entities. The recent push for disclosure has prompted some agencies to reconsider their stance on UAP investigations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue their investigations into UAP incidents, with a focus on increasing transparency and public access to information. Further developments may arise as advocacy groups demand accountability from government agencies.</p>
