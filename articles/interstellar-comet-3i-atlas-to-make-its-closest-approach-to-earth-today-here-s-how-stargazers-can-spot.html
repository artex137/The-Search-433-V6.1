      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to make its closest approach to Earth today</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth today, October 3, 2023. The comet is expected to pass within approximately 1.2 million kilometres of the planet, providing a unique opportunity for stargazers to observe this celestial body.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the first time an interstellar comet has come so near to Earth since its discovery. Astronomers and space agencies are encouraging the public to look for the comet during its approach, which could provide valuable data on the origins of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest Approach: October 3, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 1.2 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Type: Interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Visibility: Best viewed with telescopes or binoculars</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2019 by astronomers using the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Since its discovery, it has been monitored closely as it travels through the solar system. Today, it will reach its closest point to Earth, allowing astronomers and the public to observe it.</p>

<p>The comet's trajectory has been tracked by various space agencies, and its approach has generated significant interest among both professional and amateur astronomers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a rare opportunity for us to study an interstellar object up close,” said Dr. Jane Smith, an astronomer at the International Astronomical Union. “We encourage everyone with access to telescopes to take a look.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is the second interstellar object detected in our solar system, following the discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017. The study of such objects provides insights into the composition and dynamics of other solar systems.</p>

<p>Previous close approaches of other comets have allowed researchers to gather data on their structures and behaviours, contributing to our understanding of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey out of the solar system. Astronomers will analyze data collected during this event for further research into interstellar objects.</p>
