      <h2>Trump Orders Release of UFO Files After Obama’s Comments on Aliens</h2>

<p>President Trump has directed his administration to identify and release government files on UFOs and any "alien and extraterrestrial life" as of February 20, 2026. This directive follows recent comments made by former President Obama regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This move may prompt renewed scrutiny of military investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). In a social media post, Trump instructed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other agency heads to begin the process of identifying and releasing relevant documents. The specific files to be identified and the scope of the search remain unclear.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Directive issued on February 20, 2026.</li>
  <li>Trump called for the release of "any and all other information" related to UFOs.</li>
  <li>Former President Obama stated on a podcast that extraterrestrial life is real but clarified that he had seen no evidence of contact during his presidency.</li>
  <li>The Pentagon has tracked UAP reports for decades, with a 2024 report finding no evidence of extraterrestrial beings or technology.</li>
  <li>Many UAP incidents remain unresolved despite military investigations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early February 2026, former President Obama made comments on a podcast about the existence of extraterrestrial life. Following this, Trump expressed uncertainty about the existence of aliens and suggested that Obama "made a big mistake" discussing the topic publicly. On February 20, 2026, Trump ordered his administration to begin identifying and releasing UFO-related files.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Begin the process of identifying and releasing any relevant files,” Trump stated in his social media post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’m not sure whether aliens exist,” Trump added, “but I think my predecessor made a big mistake by discussing it publicly.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has long monitored reports of UAPs. A 2024 report from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office indicated there was no evidence of extraterrestrial activity. Despite many sightings being attributed to identifiable phenomena, unresolved cases continue to draw public interest and scrutiny.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The timeline for the release of UFO files remains unclear. Observers will look for formal directives from agencies, inventories of documents, and any updates from the Office responsible for UAP reviews. This development is expected to renew public and congressional interest in how the government handles information about unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>
