      <h2>Forget 3I/ATLAS — a city-sized green comet called C/2024 E1 is racing toward Earth</h2>

<p>A faint green comet known as Comet Wierzchoś, officially designated C/2024 E1, is passing through the inner solar system, drawing interest from astronomers worldwide. The comet is currently about 151 million kilometres from Earth, approximately the same distance that separates the planet from the Sun. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This comet matters because it is a relic from the early solar system, developed around 4.5 billion years ago. Authorities and astronomers are observing it closely as it nears its closest approach, with follow-up studies already revealing significant findings about its composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> Comet Wierzchoś (C/2024 E1)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 151 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> March 3, 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Discoverer:</strong> Kacper Wierzchoś, Polish astronomer</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> February 17, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Magnitude:</strong> 20.4</li>
    <li><strong>Current Magnitude:</strong> +7</li>
    <li><strong>Observing Equipment:</strong> Binoculars or small telescope recommended</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Wierzchoś was discovered by Kacper Wierzchoś on March 3, 2024, using a 1.5-metre Cassegrain telescope. Initially detected at a faint magnitude of 20.4, it has since been observed at a much brighter magnitude of +7.</p>
<p>On January 1, 2025, the comet will perform a Venus flyby at 0.191 astronomical units. It will then reach its closest approach to Earth on February 17, 2025, before continuing on its trajectory out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The green color does not come from carbon dioxide. Instead, it is the outcome from diatomic carbon (C₂) fluorescing when exposed to ultraviolet sunlight,” said a representative from the astronomy community.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>C/2024 E1 is not the first comet to capture attention for its colour. Similar green hues have been observed in comets like 3I/ATLAS, Comet Lemmon, and Comet Lovejoy. Each of these phenomena has generated interest among astronomers and the general public alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet Wierzchoś as it approaches its closest point to Earth. Future observations may provide further insight into its composition and trajectory, especially as it moves toward interstellar space.</p>
