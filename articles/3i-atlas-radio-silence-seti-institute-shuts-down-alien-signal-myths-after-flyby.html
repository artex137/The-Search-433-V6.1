      <h2>3I/ATLAS Radio Silence: SETI Institute Shuts Down Alien Signal Myths After Flyby</h2>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet 3I/ATLAS flew by Earth, sparking international interest as it brought a piece of an alien world into proximity with our planet. The comet, traveling at 130,000 miles per hour, is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the solar system. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to the flyby.</p>

<p>The flyby of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it provides a rare opportunity to study the chemical makeup of an interstellar object. Scientists are analyzing data collected from various space missions and telescopes to understand the comet's origins and its implications for planetary formation. The Breakthrough Listen project has confirmed there is no evidence of artificial signals associated with the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS flew by Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>The comet is over seven billion years old, predating Earth.</li>
    <li>It will have a close encounter with Jupiter in March 2026, passing within 33 million miles.</li>
    <li>Data from the comet will be analyzed for years to come.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected as it approached Earth, prompting a series of observations from various scientific missions. On December 18, 2025, the Green Bank Telescope scanned for signals, concluding there was no evidence of alien technology. The comet's closest approach occurred on December 19, with multiple instruments capturing data about its composition.</p>

<p>In the months leading up to its encounter, NASA's Europa Clipper and the Parker Solar Probe collected valuable data on the comet's chemical makeup and behavior. Initial images from the European Space Agency's JUICE mission have already provided insights into its structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no evidence of alien technology, with sensitivities capable of detecting a signal as weak as a single mobile phone,” said representatives from the Breakthrough Listen project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Any slight deviations in its path are entirely consistent with 'outgassing,' rather than an artificial engine,” confirmed NASA officials.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS has reignited interest in interstellar objects and the potential for life beyond Earth. Previous interstellar visitors, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, also prompted speculation regarding extraterrestrial life, but subsequent analyses have shown natural explanations for their characteristics.</p>

<p>This event illustrates the importance of collaboration among international space agencies and scientific organizations in understanding cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its flyby, 3I/ATLAS is set for a close encounter with Jupiter in March 2026. Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected during its visit, which may provide insights into the building blocks of life and the formation of planetary systems.</p>
