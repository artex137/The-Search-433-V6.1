      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Scientist Says Alien 'Interstellar Gardener' Seeded Life on Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has sparked debate over the origins of life on Earth, according to Harvard physicist Avi Loeb. Loeb claims that the object may not be a comet but a technological artefact that could have seeded life on Earth. This assertion has reignited discussions among scientists about the possibility of extraterrestrial intervention in Earth's biological history.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges the mainstream scientific consensus that Earth has developed in isolation for 4.6 billion years. Authorities, including NASA, have classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet, but Loeb argues that its unique characteristics warrant further examination. The debate highlights the need for a deeper understanding of our cosmic environment and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Claimant:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard physicist</li>
    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> NASA classifies 3I/ATLAS as a comet</li>
    <li><strong>Argument:</strong> Possibility of directed panspermia</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> 'Heartbeat'-like pulse noted by Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Expert Opinion:</strong> Leslie Looney, professor of astronomy at the University of Illinois</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has presented his theory regarding 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it could be a carrier of life forms from elsewhere in the universe. He argues that the object displays anomalies indicative of artificial origins. In contrast, Leslie Looney has asserted that the object's behavior aligns with that of a typical comet.</p>

<p>Loeb's hypothesis is based on the concept of directed panspermia, which posits that life is spread intentionally across the universe. He emphasizes the need to consider the implications of extraterrestrial visitors and their potential influence on Earth's life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There were plenty of opportunities for residents of previous stars to visit our place. But if there is an interstellar gardener, then obviously it could have intervened....it could have seeded the various forms of life on Earth intentionally.”</blockquote>
<p>- Avi Loeb</p>

<blockquote>“It's acting just like a piece of rock and ice would. We are seeing material from another solar system come swinging through our solar system.”</blockquote>
<p>- Leslie Looney</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS is part of a larger inquiry into the search for extraterrestrial life. The concept of directed panspermia has been debated among scientists for years, with varying opinions on its validity. While some experts support the idea that life could be distributed through space, others maintain skepticism without substantial evidence.</p>

<p>Moreover, researchers at the SETI Institute are actively searching for technosignatures—signals that could indicate non-human technology. Sofia Sheikh, a technosignature research scientist, emphasizes the challenges in identifying such signals amidst the noise of human technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the debate over 3I/ATLAS continues, further investigations into its properties and origins are expected. Researchers will remain vigilant in examining the data and exploring the implications of potential extraterrestrial visitation.</p>
