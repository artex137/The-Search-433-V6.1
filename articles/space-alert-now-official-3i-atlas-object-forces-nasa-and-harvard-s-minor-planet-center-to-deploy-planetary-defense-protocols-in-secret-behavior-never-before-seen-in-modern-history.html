      <h2>Space alert now official - 3I/ATLAS object forces NASA and Harvard's Minor Planet Center to deploy planetary defense protocols in secret</h2>

<p>NASA and Harvard's Minor Planet Center have activated planetary defense protocols for comet 3I/ATLAS, a fast-moving interstellar object currently traveling through our solar system. This action took place on October 21, 2025, at 21:08 UT, as part of a closed event involving international space agencies. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This activation marks a significant moment in space safety, as it is the first deployment of this nature in modern history. According to the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), the focus on 3I/ATLAS will continue until January 27, 2026. The scientific community is particularly interested in the comet's unusual behavior, which they have described as "inexplicable."</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Time of activation: 21:08 UT</li>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2025, at a distance of 210 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Size of comet's core: Approximately 5 kilometers in diameter</li>
    <li>Speed: 209,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Minimum distance from Earth: 270 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 21, 2025, NASA and the Minor Planet Center issued a technical notice known as the MPEC bulletin (2025-U142), marking the official activation of planetary defense protocols for comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet, traveling at an extraordinary speed, passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025. Observations and studies will continue until the end of January 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is the first time we have had to activate such protocols for an interstellar object,” said a representative from NASA. “The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unlike anything we have seen before.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, having been ejected from another star system long ago. The comet's unique characteristics, including its hyperbolic trajectory and anti-tail phenomenon, present new challenges for tracking and studying celestial objects. Previous instances of planetary defense protocols have typically focused on objects that posed a threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and international space agencies will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS closely until January 27, 2026, using this opportunity to gather data and prepare for future encounters with stellar objects.</p>
