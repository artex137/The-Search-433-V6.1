      <h2>US Congress shown mysterious radar video of Hellfire missile 'bouncing off UFO'</h2>

<p>US lawmakers have viewed a radar video that reportedly shows a Hellfire missile striking a "glowing orb" off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. The footage was presented by US lawmaker Eric Burlison during a hearing of the House Committee on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), which investigates UFOs. The Pentagon has not confirmed the authenticity of the video.</p>

<p>This disclosure has raised questions about unidentified aerial phenomena and their implications for national security. Lawmakers and military officials are discussing the need for further investigation into these occurrences, as the video adds to a growing body of unexplained military encounters with aerial objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Type of missile: 100-pound Hellfire air-to-ground round</li>
    <li>Presented by: US lawmaker Eric Burlison</li>
    <li>Investigating body: House Committee on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena</li>
    <li>Number of incidents catalogued by AARO: More than 700</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone reportedly fired a Hellfire missile at a glowing orb over the ocean. The missile made contact but appeared to bounce off the object and continue on its trajectory.</p>
<p>The video was shown during a House Government Oversight subcommittee hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena, where Burlison stated he had received the clip. Other witnesses, including veteran UFO journalist George Knapp, commented on the incident, expressing their astonishment at the missile’s failure to affect the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’m not going to explain it to you, you’ll see exactly what it does,” Burlison said before playing the video.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It kept going, and it looks like the debris was taken with it,” he added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There’s a server where there’s a whole bank of these kinds of videos that Congress has not been allowed to see — that the public has not been allowed to see,” George Knapp stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident adds to a series of military encounters with unidentified objects, including a 2015 video dubbed “Go Fast,” which was later attributed to optical illusions. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has been tasked with investigating UFO reports but maintains that none have shown evidence of extraterrestrial origin.</p>
<p>Former military personnel have testified about numerous unexplained encounters, including sightings of massive craft at military installations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers are expected to continue discussions regarding the implications of this footage and the need for transparency around military encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena. Further investigations may be initiated to determine the origins and nature of these incidents.</p>
