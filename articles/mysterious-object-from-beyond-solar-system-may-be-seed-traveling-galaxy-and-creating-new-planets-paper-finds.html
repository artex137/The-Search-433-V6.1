      <h2>Mysterious Object From Beyond Solar System May Be "Seed" Traveling Galaxy and Creating New Planets, Paper Finds</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered a mysterious object, designated 3I/ATLAS, that has entered the inner solar system from interstellar space earlier this year. Researchers have focused their efforts on studying its unusual composition and origins using powerful telescopes.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it may reshape our understanding of planet formation. In a paper presented at the Joint Meeting of the Europlanet Science Congress and the Division of Planetary Sciences last week in Germany, astrophysicist Susanne Pfalzner proposed that interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS could serve as "seeds" for giant planets, especially around young stars. NASA has disputed claims that the object is a remnant of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Event year: 2023</li>
    <li>Research presented: Last week in Germany</li>
    <li>Researcher: Susanne Pfalzner</li>
    <li>First interstellar object spotted: 'Oumuamua, 2017</li>
    <li>Length of 'Oumuamua: Approximately 100 metres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS as it approached the inner solar system. Following its discovery, researchers have utilized advanced telescopes to analyse the object's characteristics. In September 2023, Susanne Pfalzner presented her findings at a scientific conference in Germany, proposing that interstellar objects could play a crucial role in the formation of planets around young stars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Interstellar objects may be able to jump-start planet formation, in particular around higher-mass stars," said Pfalzner.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Therefore, interstellar object-seeded planet formation should be more efficient around these stars, providing a fast way to form giant planets," she added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This research highlights a potential solution to longstanding questions about how large planets, particularly gas giants, form around younger stars. Current theories of planet formation primarily involve the accretion of smaller particles. However, these theories do not adequately explain the presence of gas giants in certain star systems, particularly in "M dwarf" systems, which are known to be cooler and smaller.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Pfalzner and her team are continuing their investigations into how many interstellar objects could potentially become planetary bodies and their distribution across the accretion disks of distant stars.</p>
