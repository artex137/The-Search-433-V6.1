      <h2>Detection of radio waves in interstellar object puts NASA defense team on alert</h2>

<p>NASA has activated advanced monitoring protocols after detecting unusual radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traversing the solar system. The comet, originally identified on July 1, 2025, is emitting patterns of radio waves that have prompted a global response from observatories as they seek to understand the nature of these emissions.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it raises questions about the comet's composition and behavior. NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office has mobilized to analyze the signals, which may indicate either rare natural phenomena or potential technosignatures of non-human origin. Observatories worldwide are collecting data to investigate the source of the radio waves before the comet moves away into deep space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified by the ATLAS alert system on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Persistent radio signals were detected by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Signals were observed at a frequency of 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA's Deep Space Network is involved in the analysis of the signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS alert system. Following its identification, it was classified as the third interstellar object confirmed by scientists. The situation escalated on October 24, 2025, when the MeerKAT radio telescope detected unusual radio signals at a frequency of 1.6 GHz, prompting an international response.</p>
<p>NASA and global observatories have since coordinated efforts to analyze the signals and gather data in anticipation of the comet's closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of these signals has mobilized the international astronomical community to ensure comprehensive data collection during the comet's brief visibility,” said a spokesperson from NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While we currently do not face any impact risk, this situation provides an important opportunity to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior interstellar visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the diversity of celestial objects. However, 3I/ATLAS stands out due to its unusual electromagnetic activity. The ongoing analysis could yield information about the presence of volatile compounds or rare metals in the comet’s nucleus.</p>
<p>This event also serves as a test for planetary defense systems, emphasizing the importance of rapid detection and analysis of unexpected celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its international partners will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS until it becomes undetectable. The results from this observation will contribute to our understanding of interstellar materials and improve readiness for future celestial threats.</p>
