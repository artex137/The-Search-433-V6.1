      <h2>Space agencies conducting largest ever planetary defense drill with 3I/ATLAS approaching</h2>

<p>Space agencies around the world have launched the largest planetary defense drill to prepare for potential threats from outer space as comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth. The drill began on November 27, 2025, and will continue through January 2026. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This drill is significant as it allows agencies to practice tracking celestial objects and assess potential impacts. According to NASA, this event provides a crucial opportunity for global observers to refine their tracking capabilities in case of future hazardous comets. The International Asteroid Warning Network, which includes NASA, the European Space Agency, and over 23 nations, is leading the initiative to monitor Near-Earth Objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Drill Duration:</strong> November 27, 2025, to January 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies Involved:</strong> NASA, European Space Agency, International Asteroid Warning Network</li>
    <li><strong>Tracking Systems:</strong> Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, terrestrial telescopes in Hawaii, Chile, and Australia</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 27, 2025, global space agencies initiated the largest planetary defense drill in response to the approaching comet 3I/ATLAS. The drill aims to enhance tracking and monitoring capabilities for potentially hazardous celestial objects.</p>

<p>As part of the drill, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has joined efforts to track the comet's trajectory. The European Space Agency has utilized data from multiple terrestrial telescopes and space probes to refine its observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is an excellent opportunity for observers around the world to practice tracking where a comet is in the sky, should a hazardous comet to Earth ever be found,” NASA representatives said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Hazards originating in space carry the risk of sudden disaster and potentially derailing everyday life,” the ESA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS approach highlights the increasing focus on planetary defense, especially following incidents where asteroids have come close to Earth. In 2022, NASA successfully redirected an asteroid named Dimorphos as part of its Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission.</p>

<p>Experts emphasize the need for improved monitoring and mitigation strategies for celestial threats, with discussions ongoing about establishing a comprehensive planetary defense network.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the drill, agencies will continue to refine their tracking systems and develop mitigation strategies for potential future threats from space. Further assessments of comet 3I/ATLAS will be conducted as it nears its closest approach.</p>
