      <h2>NASA and UN intensify monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS after radio signals and space threat warning</h2>

<p>NASA has intensified monitoring of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after its inclusion on the UN’s list of space threats. The comet, discovered in July 2025, approaches Earth at a speed exceeding <strong>60 km/s</strong> and is expected to reach its closest point in December 2025. This has prompted planetary defense protocols to assess the risks of a potential collision and to investigate mysterious radio signals detected from the comet.</p>

<p>The monitoring efforts are crucial due to the comet's origin from an ancient star system approximately seven billion years old. Authorities aim to gather more data on the comet’s structure and behavior, which may significantly enhance existing defense models against similar cosmic threats in the future.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Approach speed:</strong> greater than 60 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> stellar system approximately seven billion years old</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Detected compounds:</strong> water, carbon monoxide, methane</li>
    <li><strong>Detection of radio signals:</strong> reported by an observatory in South Africa</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS observatory discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, detailed spectroscopic studies revealed the presence of volatile compounds, indicating active sublimation processes. On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet from a distance of 445 million kilometers.</p>

<p>In late 2025, an observatory in South Africa reported detecting radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS, which added a new dimension to the study of the comet. This led to the UN classifying the comet as a potential space threat due to its high speed and unusual trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The approach speed exceeding 60 km/s requires continuous monitoring by global space agencies,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Its unusual trajectory was the main reason for its classification as a potential threat.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, compared the size of the comet to the island of Manhattan, stating, “The potential impact would crucially depend on the total mass of the celestial body.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its interstellar origin, which has intrigued scientists and prompted discussions regarding its formation and trajectory. The detection of radio signals from the comet is a significant development, as it indicates natural interactions with the space environment rather than artificial origins.</p>

<p>NASA has previously warned about the need for improved planetary defense strategies, especially as interstellar objects become more prevalent in scientific observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to deploy advanced probes and telescopes during the December 2025 flyby to collect crucial data on 3I/ATLAS. These efforts will enhance understanding of the comet's structure and behavior, contributing to improved protection strategies against future space threats.</p>
