      <h2>NASA Releases Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>NASA has released images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) during a mission on October 2, 2025. The images have sparked a wave of reactions online, with many users expressing disappointment over their quality, while researchers emphasize the challenges involved in capturing such distant objects.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object observed passing through our solar system. NASA plans to provide further analysis and address public questions in an upcoming event scheduled for November 20, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Release of images of comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of imaging: October 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Agency involved: NASA, via the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
    <li>Distance of comet: Approximately 19 million miles from Earth</li>
    <li>Next public event: November 20, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2025, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter turned its focus away from Mars to capture images of 3I/ATLAS. Following the release of these images, social media users reacted with a mix of humor and skepticism regarding their quality.</p>
<p>As criticism grew, Dr. Jake Taylor, an Oxford astrophysicist, addressed some of the concerns, explaining the limitations of the imaging technology used. He noted that the MRO was designed primarily for capturing images of Mars, not for distant interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The satellite around Mars is not designed for such faint targets; it’s designed to stare at the Mars surface, it was never going to be a detailed image.” 
    — Dr. Jake Taylor, Oxford astrophysicist
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “LOL, it's from 19 million miles away and wasn't designed to take pictures of space objects but the surface of Mars. Thanks for playing.” 
    — NASA HiRISE Twitter account
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This imaging event comes as part of NASA's ongoing exploration of the solar system and its various celestial objects. Previous missions have successfully captured detailed images of Mars and other celestial bodies, but the technological limitations of the MRO present challenges when observing faint objects such as 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is scheduled to hold a deep dive session on November 20, 2025, to further discuss the images of 3I/ATLAS and answer public inquiries regarding the comet and the technology used to capture its images.</p>
