      <h2>New Data on the Extreme Nickel Production of 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>A new report from the UVES spectrograph at the European Very Large Telescope in Chile has revealed significant findings about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The report details an anomalous abundance of nickel and iron in the gas plume surrounding the comet, which challenges existing scientific understanding. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This data is critical as it raises questions about the processes occurring in comets at large distances from the sun. Researchers are currently observing 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars, which could provide further insights into its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Report from the European Very Large Telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Nickel detected at all observed heliocentric distances</li>
    <li>Iron detected only within 2.64 AU of the sun</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is passing within 29 million kilometers of Mars from October 1-7, 2025</li>
    <li>Diameter of 3I/ATLAS estimated to be larger than 5 kilometers</li>
    <li>HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will capture images with 30 kilometers per pixel resolution</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured the highest resolution image of 3I/ATLAS from a distance of 570 million kilometers. This was 20 times farther than its closest approach to Mars. The new report was released following these observations, highlighting the peculiar presence of nickel and iron in the comet's plume.</p>
<p>During the week of October 1-7, 2025, NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA’s Mars orbiters will conduct further observations as 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“At the distances at which comets are observed, the temperature is far too low to vaporize silicate, sulfide, and metallic grains that contain nickel and iron atoms. Therefore, the presence of nickel and iron atoms in cometary coma is extremely puzzling,” the authors of the report stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is the third identified object of its kind, following 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous studies have shown that the typical abundance ratio of nickel to iron in comets is generally higher than that found in solar system comets. The unusual findings related to 3I/ATLAS could provide new insights into the composition and formation of comets from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars. The upcoming observations may clarify the comet's unusual composition and further investigate the discrepancies in its size and mass compared to prior interstellar objects.</p>
