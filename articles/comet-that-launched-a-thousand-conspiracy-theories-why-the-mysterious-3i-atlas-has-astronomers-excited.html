      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Closest Point to the Sun</h2>
<p>On 30 October, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun, approximately 1.4 astronomical units (au) or about <strong>210 million kilometres</strong> away. The comet will come within about 1.8 au, or <strong>270 million kilometres</strong>, of Earth, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The comet has generated significant interest within the scientific community due to its unique characteristics and origins from outside the solar system. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain at a safe distance during its approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach to the Sun: <strong>30 October</strong></li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at closest point: <strong>1.4 au</strong> (about <strong>210 million kilometres</strong>)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: <strong>1.8 au</strong> (about <strong>270 million kilometres</strong>)</li>
    <li>Discovery location: Chile</li>
    <li>Comet shedding water: <strong>40 kg per second</strong></li>
    <li>Initial discovery: <strong>2023</strong></li>
    <li>First reporting system: NASA-funded ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified by scientists in Chile earlier this year. Observations revealed its unique teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust surrounding a solid, icy nucleus. NASA confirmed the comet's hyperbolic orbital path, indicating that it originates from outside the solar system.</p>
<p>As it approaches the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will remain visible to ground-based telescopes through September 2023, before becoming too close to the Sun for observation. It is expected to reappear on the other side of the Sun in early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official Statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS should remain visible to ground-based telescopes through September, after which it will pass too close to the Sun to observe,” NASA stated in its latest update.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its discovery has sparked discussions about the nature of interstellar objects and their significance in understanding the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s Next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, gathering data on its composition and behaviour. Observations will resume in December 2025 when the comet reemerges from behind the Sun.</p>
