      <h2>Rare UFO clouds spotted in north Wales skies</h2>

<p>Mysterious and unusually shaped clouds have been spotted over Newborough Beach on Anglesey, north Wales, last week, capturing the attention of locals and visitors alike. The clouds, resembling flying saucers and pancakes, have been mistaken for UFOs in the past, but are officially known as lenticular clouds.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant because lenticular clouds are uncommon in the UK, requiring specific weather conditions to form. The sighting has prompted interest from the public and meteorological experts, with the Met Office providing insights into how these clouds develop.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Newborough Beach, Anglesey, north Wales</li>
    <li>Cloud type: Lenticular clouds</li>
    <li>Duration of sighting: Approximately 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Weather conditions: Stable, moist air over mountain ranges</li>
    <li>Met Office statement: Lenticular clouds indicate strong winds below</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Last week, visitors to Traeth Llanddwyn in Newborough observed the unusual cloud formations as they drifted in from the Pen Llŷn mountains. The clouds appeared suddenly and lasted for about 10 minutes, delighting hikers in the area.</p>

<p>Dove Rosalinda, a frequent hiker in Snowdonia, expressed her excitement at witnessing the clouds, recalling her previous encounters with the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "When air blows across a mountain range, in certain circumstances, it can set up a train of large standing waves in the air downstream," said a spokesperson from the Met Office. "If there is enough moisture in the air, the rising motion of the wave will cause water vapour to condense, forming the unique appearance of lenticular clouds."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Lenticular clouds have been reported in various locations but are particularly rare in the UK. The unique formations often occur when stable air flows over mountains, creating standing waves in the atmosphere. This phenomenon can also signal strong winds below, which is why pilots generally avoid flying near them due to potential turbulence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No further investigations are planned regarding the cloud formations, as they are a natural meteorological occurrence. The public can continue to enjoy and photograph these rare sights when conditions allow.</p>
