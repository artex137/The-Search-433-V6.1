      <h2>Comet ATLAS breaks into three pieces under 'huge amount of gravitational strain' from sun</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has fragmented into three pieces as it neared the sun, scientists reported on October 8. The celestial object displayed a golden shimmer in its coma and tail before disintegration was observed. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the comet's breakup.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it limits the opportunity for researchers to study the comet closely, particularly with a planned Earth pass on November 25. The fragmentation has drawn attention due to the comet's unusual behavior and the speculation surrounding its nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached the sun on October 8.</li>
    <li>The comet fragmented into three sections observed over several days in November.</li>
    <li>The closest Earth pass was scheduled for November 25.</li>
    <li>Austrian astrophotographer Michael Jäger documented the fragmentation.</li>
    <li>NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet, despite speculation about it being an alien spaceship.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 8, 3I/ATLAS came closest to the sun, exhibiting a notable golden shimmer. Early November observations revealed brightness surges, leading to the detection of fragmentation. Over several days, from November 12 to November 20, the comet was seen splitting into three brighter fragments.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Following brightness surges in early November, we have been able to observe this comet splitting into three brighter fragments for the past two weeks,” said Austrian astrophotographer Michael Jäger.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA scientists have firmly identified 3I/ATLAS as a “comet,” responding to claims that it could be a spaceship.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a group of comets identified by the same telescope system, including C/2025 K1. While C/2025 K1 has recently been overshadowed, its survival through solar encounters was uncertain. The speculation about comets being alien spaceships, particularly by theoretical physicist Avi Loeb, has prompted significant media attention and public interest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor the remnants of 3I/ATLAS in the Leo constellation. The planned observation during its Earth pass on November 25 will not occur as intended due to the comet's fragmentation.</p>
