      <h2>Visitor from another 3I/ATLAS system moves away from Earth after closest point</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers. No injuries or fatalities have been reported, as the comet did not pose any threat of collision.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks a rare opportunity for scientists to study an object confirmed to be of external origin to the Solar System. Observations from both space and ground-based telescopes have provided valuable data regarding the comet’s composition and behavior. The comet is now moving away from the Sun and will not return to the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest point: 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025 by ATLAS program in Chile</li>
    <li>Entry speed into Solar System: over 60 km/s</li>
    <li>Passed perihelion: October 29, 2025, at 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter: between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Next close approach: March 2026, near Jupiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was initially detected on July 1, 2025, by telescopes from the ATLAS program. Observations prior to discovery date back to June, when the comet was crossing dense star fields.</p>

<p>Following its discovery, international teams confirmed its classification as an active comet. The object entered the Solar System at high speed and exhibited a coma and tail during its approach to the Sun. After passing perihelion in late October, the comet headed towards Earth, culminating in its closest approach on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>Now, 3I/ATLAS is moving away from the Sun and will escape the gravitational influence of the Solar System in the coming decades.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This single pass has allowed us to collect rare information about an interstellar object,” said a spokesperson for the ATLAS program. “The data we gather from 3I/ATLAS will advance our models of external planetary formation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS differs from previous interstellar visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. While ‘Oumuamua did not show clear cometary characteristics, and Borisov had a composition closer to local comets, 3I/ATLAS exhibited intense activity with a visible tail and unique emissions. This variation enriches the study of interstellar diversity and provides insights into the formation of distant environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Data from 3I/ATLAS continues to be analyzed by global teams, and ongoing research will focus on understanding its composition and origin. Future telescopes are expected to detect more interstellar objects, enhancing our knowledge of the galaxy.</p>
