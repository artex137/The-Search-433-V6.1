      <h2>When The Sun Hides Secrets — Will 3I/ATLAS Emerge Changed Like ʻOumuamua?</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has disappeared behind the Sun, making it inaccessible to ground-based telescopes since July 2025. As it hides from view, astronomers have raised questions about its behavior and the Sun’s current activity.</p>

<p>This situation is significant because it mirrors the mystery surrounding the first known interstellar object, ʻOumuamua, which exhibited unusual behavior when it passed through the solar system. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring the Sun's heightened activity and 3I/ATLAS's trajectory as it re-emerges later this month.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS entered the solar system in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently approximately 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has reported high carbon dioxide levels on the comet.</li>
    <li>The Sun has experienced increased solar flares and geomagnetic storms in recent weeks.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to reappear from behind the Sun in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA and other agencies are preparing to monitor the comet’s behavior upon its return.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS entered the solar system, capturing the attention of astronomers due to its unusual characteristics. By September, the comet was hidden behind the Sun, coinciding with the discovery of asteroid 2025 SC79, which also moved behind the Sun. Since then, solar activity has intensified, leading to increased interest in the relationship between the Sun and interstellar objects.</p>

<p>As the Sun approaches its solar maximum, scientists have recorded a surge in solar flares and coronal mass ejections. This has prompted discussions within the scientific community regarding potential interactions between the Sun’s magnetic field and interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If interstellar objects carry magnetic or charged materials unlike our local solar debris, their passage through the Sun’s heliosphere could, in theory, interact with the solar magnetic field,” said an astrophysicist familiar with ongoing observations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, including ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have demonstrated unusual acceleration as they passed close to the Sun. Scientists remain uncertain about the exact mechanisms behind these behaviors, which have sparked ongoing research into the dynamics of interstellar travel and solar interactions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS is set to re-emerge from behind the Sun, astronomers will closely observe its brightness, tail structure, and velocity. This data will help determine whether the comet exhibits similar anomalies to those seen with ʻOumuamua, potentially revealing new insights into interstellar objects and solar dynamics.</p>
