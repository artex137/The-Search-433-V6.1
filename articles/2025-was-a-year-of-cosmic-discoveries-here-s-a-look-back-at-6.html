      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Marks a Milestone in Cosmic Discoveries</h2>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope last observed comet 3I/ATLAS on November 30, 2025, approximately four months after its initial observation. The comet has gained attention as the third interstellar object discovered in our solar system, originating from a distinct part of the galaxy. Its significance stems from its unique characteristics and the insights it offers into the cosmos.</p>

<p>Authorities have conducted extensive observations of 3I/ATLAS, highlighting its rarity and the technological advancements in space observation. The data collected from various instruments, including the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the STEREO-A spacecraft, have provided valuable information about the comet's composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was last observed by Hubble on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was first observed four months prior to its last sighting.</li>
    <li>It reached a distance of 170 million miles from Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels through the solar system at a speed of 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>The comet was imaged 19 million miles from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on October 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>Colorized images of 3I/ATLAS were created from data collected between September 11-25, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 30, 2025, astronomers first identified 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar object. Following this, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope conducted its first observation of the comet. On October 2, 2025, the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera captured images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing its features from a distance of 19 million miles. The comet reached its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a remarkable find, offering a glimpse into the composition of interstellar objects,” said a NASA spokesperson. “The observations conducted by our instruments enhance our understanding of the universe.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three interstellar objects discovered in our solar system, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. These discoveries have prompted increased interest in studying the origins and characteristics of celestial bodies that travel from other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. Future observations may yield further insights into the nature of interstellar comets and their potential implications for understanding the galaxy.</p>
