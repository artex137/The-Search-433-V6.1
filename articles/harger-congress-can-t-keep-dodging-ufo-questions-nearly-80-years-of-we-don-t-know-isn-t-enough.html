      <h2>Harger: Congress can’t keep dodging UFO questions</h2>

<p>On September 9, 2025, members of Congress are holding another hearing on UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena, on Capitol Hill. This marks the third such hearing in three years, as lawmakers seek to address lingering questions about these phenomena.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it reflects ongoing public and governmental interest in UAPs. Authorities, including the Pentagon, have faced scrutiny over their handling of UAP reports and the lack of transparency surrounding them. As interest grows, many are calling for clearer answers from officials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Type of hearing: UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomena)</li>
    <li>Number of hearings: Three in the past three years</li>
    <li>Key figures: U.S. Navy pilots, Pentagon’s UAP office, NASA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The interest in UAPs has deep roots, with the first reported sighting occurring in 1947 over Mount Rainier in Washington State. Since then, reports of strange objects in the sky have persisted, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The Pentagon has faced mounting pressure to provide more information, particularly after the Inspector General opened a review of UAP report handling in 2021.</p>

<p>Recent discussions have highlighted a Navy pilot's account of a white, capsule-shaped object, referred to as the “Tic Tac,” which exhibited extraordinary flight capabilities. This has led to further questions about the nature of these phenomena and their implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Shouldn’t Congress be pressing for an explanation of that? And why haven’t they been given the full radar and cockpit recordings?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If these things are foreign technology, say so. If they’re sensor glitches, put it on the record. And if they’re something we’ve never seen before … then admit it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around UAPs has intensified, especially after the Pentagon’s Inspector General initiated a review of UAP report handling in 2021. This review indicates serious concerns regarding how UAPs are monitored and reported. Additionally, the emergence of credible eyewitness accounts from military personnel has added weight to the calls for transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Congress continues its hearings, many are looking for definitive answers regarding the nature of UAPs and the findings of previous investigations. The public and lawmakers alike are demanding greater transparency from the Pentagon and related agencies.</p>
