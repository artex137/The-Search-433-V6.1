      <h2>Space agency activates its largest planetary defense drill as interstellar visitor approaches Earth</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA have activated their largest planetary defense drill as the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, set to reach its closest point on Friday, December 19, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This drill, involving over 23 nations, aims to enhance tracking capabilities for potential threats from space. Although 3I/ATLAS will pass at a distance of 170 million miles—approximately twice the distance between Earth and the sun—officials have emphasized the importance of preparation for future high-velocity near-Earth objects (NEOs) that could pose a risk to the planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Activation of a planetary defense drill by ESA and NASA.</li>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>Involved agencies: ESA, NASA, and over 23 nations.</li>
    <li>Drill duration: Through January 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since late November 2025, ESA has been refining its predictions for 3I/ATLAS by gathering data from telescopes in Hawaii, Chile, and Australia, as well as from various space probes, including Mars Express and Juice. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has also contributed to the global effort.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, ESA has been utilizing its quick-warning computer system, 'Meerkat,' to monitor new telescope data and send alerts about potential threats. This system operates 24/7, providing rapid notifications to astronomers regarding imminent dangers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Hazards originating in space carry the risk of sudden disaster and potentially derailing everyday life, from natural threats like asteroids and solar storms to the human-made one of space debris,” ESA stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It is no longer sci-fi, it is a skill we must hone before it is needed,” ESA added, referring to the necessity of developing an asteroid deflection system.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>ESA has highlighted the importance of this drill as part of ongoing efforts to prepare for future NEOs that could threaten Earth. The agency noted that upcoming events, such as the close approach of the asteroid Apophis in 2029, will draw significant public interest in planetary defense capabilities.</p>
<p>In its 2025 budget proposal, ESA outlined several space threats that require careful monitoring to prevent potential disasters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS nears Earth, ESA and NASA will continue to refine tracking methods and prepare for future NEOs, ensuring that systems like Meerkat and Aegis are fully operational in the event of an actual threat.</p>
