      <h2>Astronomer Estimates 30-40 Percent Chance Mysterious Interstellar Object Is Alien Craft Disguised as a Comet</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has suggested that there is a 30 to 40 percent chance that interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, discovered in early July, is not a natural comet but potentially a piece of technology from an intelligent extraterrestrial civilization. The object, which has been detected passing through our solar system, has raised eyebrows due to its unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges current understanding of interstellar objects. Loeb's claims come amid ongoing observations from multiple space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), which are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery Date: Early July 2023</li>
    <li>Estimated Mass: Over 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Close Approach to Mars: Last week</li>
    <li>Upcoming Observations: ESA’s Juice spacecraft next month; NASA’s Juno spacecraft in March 2024</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in early July 2023. Since then, it has drawn attention for its highly unusual trajectory and mass. It made a close approach to Mars last week, where it was photographed by NASA's Perseverance rover and ESA's Mars orbiters.</p>
<p>Loeb's analysis of the object has evolved, particularly with the upcoming close approaches of ESA’s Juice and NASA’s Juno spacecraft, which could provide critical data on the object's interaction with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As of now, I assign a 30 to 40 percent likelihood that 3I/ATLAS does not have a fully natural origin,” Loeb stated in a Q&A on his personal blog.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Colin Wilson, ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars project scientist, remarked, “Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, “As far as I know, there are no protocols for responding to the discovery of functioning alien devices near Earth.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following two previous detections. The unusual properties of 3I/ATLAS, including its chemical composition and an anti-tail pointing towards the Sun, have prompted speculation about its origins.</p>
<p>Loeb's warning about potential alien technology highlights a lack of preparedness for such discoveries, contrasting with established protocols for detecting distant signals from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing investigations will continue as the ESA's Juice spacecraft approaches 3I/ATLAS next month and NASA's Juno spacecraft observes it near Jupiter in March 2024. The data collected during these close encounters may clarify the object's nature and origins.</p>
