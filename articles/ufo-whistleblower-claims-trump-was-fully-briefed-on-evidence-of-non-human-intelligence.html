      <h2>UFO whistleblower claims Trump was 'fully briefed' on evidence of non-human intelligence</h2>

<p>A whistleblower has claimed that former U.S. President Donald Trump was fully briefed on evidence of non-human intelligence, according to a recent report. The allegations have surfaced amid ongoing discussions about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and government transparency regarding such phenomena.</p>

<p>This development matters as it raises questions about the extent of government knowledge regarding UFOs and non-human intelligence. Authorities are currently reviewing these claims, which could influence future policies on disclosure and public awareness of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>The allegations have emerged during a broader discourse on UFOs.</li>
    <li>Government agencies are reportedly examining the validity of these claims.</li>
    <li>No specific dates or locations for the briefings have been disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<h2>Context</h2>
