      <h2>Shock Claims Emerge as New UFO Whistleblower Says Earth Triggered Alien Surveillance Billions of Years Ago</h2>

<p>A Reddit whistleblower, known as 'Rhea', has claimed that Earth has been under alien surveillance for billions of years, according to a post on her account that attracts approximately 650,000 visitors weekly. Her allegations, which include information about secret intelligence units and extraterrestrial councils, have quickly circulated across social media platforms, sparking widespread debate.</p>

<p>This matter has drawn attention from UFO enthusiasts, skeptics, and curious readers, raising questions about government knowledge of extraterrestrial life and the implications for humanity. Authorities have not responded officially to Rhea's claims, which remain unverified.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Whistleblower identified as 'Rhea'</li>
    <li>Claims Earth has been monitored by aliens for approximately two billion years</li>
    <li>Rhea previously served in military and a classified intelligence unit</li>
    <li>Claims of an alleged relocation of 65,000 humans to a planet orbiting the star 82 Eridani</li>
    <li>Rhea alleges ongoing monitoring by 'The Council', a collective of advanced civilizations</li>
    <li>Post has sparked significant online debate and criticism regarding its credibility</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Rhea claims that Earth was first detected by an alien surveillance network roughly two billion years ago, triggered by atmospheric biosignatures. She describes how she was drawn into the investigation of sensor anomalies while working in a classified intelligence unit.</p>
<p>Over time, Rhea alleges that a pattern of unexplained phenomena emerged, leading her and her colleagues to suspect advanced technology was monitoring Earth. Eventually, she claims to have been shown classified information that altered her understanding of human existence and extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “According to Rhea, some extraterrestrial civilisations are hostile towards the Council's monitoring programme.” 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “She insists that time is limited and that the truth will soon be impossible to hide.” 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This recent post comes at a time when interest in UFOs has surged, particularly following earlier government disclosures about unidentified aerial phenomena. Rhea's narrative intertwines established scientific concepts with traditional UFO themes, contributing to ongoing discussions about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions continue online, it remains unclear if any official investigations will arise from Rhea's claims. The response from authorities and the scientific community is still pending.</p>
