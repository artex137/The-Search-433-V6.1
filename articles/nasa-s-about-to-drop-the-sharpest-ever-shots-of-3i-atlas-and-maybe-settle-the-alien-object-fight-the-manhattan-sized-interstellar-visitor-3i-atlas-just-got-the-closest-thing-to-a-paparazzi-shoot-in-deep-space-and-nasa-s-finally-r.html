      <h2>NASA to Release High-Resolution Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has announced that it will soon release the highest-resolution images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera. The images are expected to be revealed as early as next week, following a delay caused by a government shutdown. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this announcement.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant because they may help clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which has sparked debate among scientists. Some experts, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have questioned whether the object is a comet or something else entirely. The upcoming images could provide crucial insights into its composition and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Images expected to be released: Next week.</li>
    <li>Camera used: HiRISE on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>HiRISE resolution surpasses previous Hubble images by a factor of 3.</li>
    <li>Current trajectory: Slingshotting toward Jupiter.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Juno and ESA’s JUICE missions will observe 3I/ATLAS until March.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October, the HiRISE camera tracked 3I/ATLAS for a week. The release of images was delayed due to a government shutdown.</p>
<p>On November 11, new images of 3I/ATLAS were shared by Mario Nawfal, showing unusual features that have prompted further investigation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This thing has a bizarre anti-tail - dust pointing toward the Sun instead of away from it. Normal comets don’t do that." - Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its unusual characteristics, which have led to speculation regarding its origin. Objects from outside the solar system typically do not remain intact as they approach the Sun. Previous observations have raised questions about whether 3I/ATLAS is a simple comet or something more complex.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The upcoming images are anticipated to fuel ongoing debates about 3I/ATLAS’s composition. Scientists will analyze the data to determine whether it is a comet, rock, or an entirely different entity.</p>
