      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS puzzles space agencies</h2>

<p>Space agencies around the globe have launched a series of planetary defense exercises in response to the unusual behavior of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited movements that defy conventional physics. The drills began on December 1, 2025, and involve multiple countries including the European Space Agency, Japan, and the United States.</p>

<p>The coordinated efforts reflect increasing concerns over 3I/ATLAS, which has captivated scientists not just for its identity but for its unpredictable actions. Authorities are mobilizing their defensive capabilities at an accelerated pace, with exercises designed to prepare for potential threats posed by the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event started on December 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Participating agencies include the European Space Agency, Japan's space agencies, and the U.S. Space Force.</li>
    <li>Australia, South Korea, and Brazil also conducted exercises.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's planetary defense system was activated for a three-day simulation.</li>
    <li>US Space Force completed an accelerated orbital tracking drill.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS displays non-gravitational acceleration, anti-tail jets, and brightness fluctuations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 1, 2025, the European Space Agency initiated its planetary defense exercises, activating a full simulation involving mission control operations and ground-based observation networks. Japan followed shortly after with a fast-tracked asteroid impact exercise, which included collaboration between civilian and military entities.</p>

<p>Within 48 hours, the U.S. Space Force conducted a high-altitude orbital tracking drill, advancing a previously scheduled exercise. Other nations, including Australia, South Korea, and Brazil, joined in with their own drills to study the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The situation with 3I/ATLAS has created an unusual political opening,” said a government source. “Technologies that normally spark international disagreements are receiving approval with minimal resistance.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The response to 3I/ATLAS marks a significant shift in international cooperation regarding planetary defense. Historical efforts to unify space monitoring capabilities have often faced delays due to political disputes, but the urgency surrounding 3I/ATLAS has expedited approvals for advanced technologies and systems.</p>

<p>Previously, deep-space monitoring systems and satellite platforms required lengthy discussions for approval. However, the current scenario has led to a rapid greenlighting of initiatives, including the European Space Agency’s $25.7 billion expansion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the situation develops, governments are expected to continue refining their tracking and defense strategies in preparation for December 19, a significant date in current tracking projections. The ongoing investigations will focus on understanding the complexities of 3I/ATLAS and the implications for global planetary defense systems.</p>
