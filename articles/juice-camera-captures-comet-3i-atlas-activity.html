      <h2>Juice Camera Captures Comet 3I/ATLAS Activity</h2>

<p>In November 2025, the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, known as Juice, has captured significant images of comet 3I/ATLAS during its observations approximately 66 million kilometers away.</p>

<p>This event is important for understanding cometary phenomena as Juice aims to gather insights into the comet’s composition and activity. The data collected will enhance scientific knowledge about comets, particularly following 3I/ATLAS’s recent closest approach to the Sun, which increased its activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Juice captured images of 3I/ATLAS on November 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach occurred on November 4, 2025.</li>
    <li>The distance from Juice to the comet was approximately 66 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Juice is equipped with five scientific instruments: JANUS, MAJIS, UVS, SWI, and PEP.</li>
    <li>Data from this encounter will return to Earth on February 18 and 20, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 2, 2025, Juice utilized its Navigation Camera (NavCam) to capture an image of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing details about the comet’s activity. Two days later, on November 4, Juice achieved its closest approach to the comet.</p>
<p>As Juice continues its mission, it is currently using its main high-gain antenna as a shield against the Sun’s heat, which has resulted in a reduced data transmission rate through its medium-gain antenna.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Juice’s observation comes shortly after 3I/ATLAS’s closest approach to the Sun, a period when it was notably more active,” ESA officials stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observations of comet 3I/ATLAS are part of ongoing research into comets, which can provide significant insights into the early solar system. Understanding the composition and behavior of comets is crucial for broader planetary science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data collected by Juice will be analyzed once it is transmitted back to Earth in February 2026. This analysis is expected to yield valuable information about the structure and activity of comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>
