      <h2>Gemini South Captures Growing Tail of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS During Educational Observing Program</h2>

<p>On 27 August 2025, the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini South at Cerro Pachón in Chile captured images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a growing tail and broad coma. The observations were part of a public outreach initiative by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), and there have been no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our Solar System. Researchers aim to analyze the comet's spectrum to gain insights into its composition and the processes involved in the formation of planetary systems around other stars. The observations were conducted during a Shadow the Scientists program, which connects the public with scientific research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observations: 27 August 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Cerro Pachón, Chile</li>
    <li>Organizing agency: U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and NSF NOIRLab</li>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Comet's tail length: approximately 1/120th of a degree</li>
    <li>Number of participating students: not disclosed</li>
    <li>First detection of 3I/ATLAS: 1 July 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. By 27 August 2025, the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph captured deep, multi-color images of the comet during a public observing session. Participants, including students from Hawai‘i and La Serena, Chile, joined remotely to interact with astronomers.</p>

<p>During the session, astronomers captured the comet's spectrum, providing data on its composition and chemistry. The observations showed that the tail of 3I/ATLAS had grown, indicating increased activity as it approached the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The primary objectives of the observations were to look at the colors of the comet, which provide clues to the composition and sizes of the dust particles in the coma, and to take spectra for a direct measure of the chemistry,” said Karen Meech, astronomer at the University of Hawai‘i Institute for Astronomy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These observations provide both a breathtaking view and critical scientific data,” said Bryce Bolin, research scientist from Eureka Scientific. “Every interstellar comet is a messenger from another star system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare occurrences, with 3I/ATLAS being only the third confirmed example, following Comet 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike comets that orbit the Sun, 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it will eventually return to interstellar space.</p>

<p>The observations conducted during this session align with NSF NOIRLab’s mission to engage the public in scientific discovery and education, fostering interest in astronomy and related fields.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>A follow-up observing session is planned for November 2025, when Comet 3I/ATLAS reemerges from behind the Sun. Bryce Bolin will lead this session from the Gemini North telescope in Hawai‘i, continuing the initiative to involve the public in astronomical research.</p>
