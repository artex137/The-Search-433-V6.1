      <h2>Marjorie Taylor Greene Claims UFOs Are 'Demonic Entities' the Government Won't Tell the Truth About</h2>

<p>U.S. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has claimed that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) may be 'fallen angels' rather than alien spacecraft during an appearance on the November 1 episode of <em>Real Time with Bill Maher</em>. The Georgia Republican suggested that demons are real and implied that parts of the U.S. government are concealing the truth about these phenomena.</p>

<p>Greene's comments have sparked controversy and highlight a growing intersection of politics, religion, and conspiracy theories in the American discourse around UFOs. Authorities, including NASA and the Pentagon, have focused on scientific explanations for unidentified aerial phenomena, contrasting sharply with Greene's supernatural theories. Her remarks have drawn both criticism and support, reflecting the polarized views on UFOs and government transparency.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>Date: November 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Not disclosed</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 1, 2023, Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared on the television show <em>Real Time with Bill Maher</em>. During the episode, she was asked about her beliefs regarding demons and UFOs. Greene affirmed her belief in demons, suggesting they could be fallen angels. When pressed by Maher about the nature of UFOs, she stated that the idea of them being fallen angels was possible and made sense within her worldview. The discussion also touched on previous claims made by military officials regarding UFOs.</p>

<p>Following her remarks, Greene addressed her past social media posts linking wildfires to space lasers, claiming she was unaware of the implications for Jewish communities. She then reiterated her belief that the government is not fully disclosing information about UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Absolutely. I'm a Bible-believing Christian. And I believe those could be fallen angels.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I think [UAP] is a serious issue. People deserve to know the truth.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Greene's statements are part of a broader pattern of controversial remarks that include previous conspiracy theories about government cover-ups. Her claims have been met with skepticism from the scientific community, which cautions against conflating religious beliefs with unidentified aerial phenomena. Recent public interest in UFOs has surged, with over 30,000 reported sightings recorded since 2022, according to the popular tracking app Enigma.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As public interest in UFOs continues to grow, discussions around government transparency and the nature of unidentified aerial phenomena are expected to persist. Investigations by agencies like NASA and the Pentagon will likely continue to focus on scientific explanations rather than supernatural theories.</p>
