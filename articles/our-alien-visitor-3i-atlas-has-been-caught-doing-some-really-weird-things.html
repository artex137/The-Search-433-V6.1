      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Raises Eyebrows with Unusual Activity</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has captured attention this week as astronomers report it has displayed atypical characteristics while moving through our solar system. First spotted in July 2025, the comet has not developed a tail, which is a common trait among comets, according to observations made by various observatories.</p>

<p>This phenomenon matters as it has led to discussions among scientists about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including astronomers from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona and the Ramon Naves Observatory in Spain, are closely monitoring the comet's behaviour. Speculation about its origins has sparked interest in the possibility of it being an artificial object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is approximately 5.6 kilometres wide (3.5 miles).</li>
    <li>The comet has exhibited a glowing green hue, with observations noting a lack of a tail.</li>
    <li>It is expected to come within 27 million kilometres (17 million miles) of Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Astronomers from the Lowell Observatory and Ramon Naves Observatory have provided key observations.</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb has speculated on the possibility of the comet being of artificial origin.</li>
    <li>Nasa has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is first detected by astronomers.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: The comet is expected to reach its closest approach to Earth, at a distance of 27 million kilometres.</p>
<p>Recent weeks: New images reveal the comet glowing green and lacking a tail, prompting further analysis by scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The coma is not very different in morphology than its appearance in the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is a dynamic object. It’s not a comet cutout in a nativity play,” stated Dr. Alfredo Carpineti, an astrophysicist and science writer for IFLScience.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object to enter our solar system. The unusual behaviour observed has rekindled discussions about the origins of such celestial bodies. Prior incidents, including the detection of the ‘Wow! Signal’ in 1977, have led to speculation about extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Investigations into its composition and behaviour will be conducted to determine the reasons for its unusual characteristics. Further observations are expected as it nears its closest point to the sun.</p>
