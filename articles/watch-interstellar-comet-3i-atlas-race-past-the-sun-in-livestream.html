      <h2>Watch interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS race past the sun in livestream</h2>

<p>Skywatchers can view the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it speeds away from the sun during a live webcast hosted by the Virtual Telescope Project. The event took place on 16th November 2025, providing high-resolution views of the comet as it exits the solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Authorities have facilitated this webcast to make the rare astronomical occurrence accessible to a global audience. The comet has re-emerged from the sun’s glare, allowing ground-based observatories to observe it after reaching perihelion on 30 October.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: 16th November 2025</li>
    <li>Comet first identified: 1st July 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: 30th October 2025</li>
    <li>Current visual magnitude: +10.9</li>
    <li>Observation location: Above the eastern horizon in Virgo</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1st July 2025. Following trajectory analysis, it was confirmed as an interstellar visitor, marking a significant event in astronomy. The comet reached perihelion on 30 October 2025 and has since become visible from Earth as it moves away from the sun.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to rise before dawn throughout mid to late November, making it accessible to skywatchers with modest telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This livestream offers a rare opportunity to observe an interstellar body on an outbound trajectory,” said a representative from the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects have been confirmed as visitors to our solar system. The study of such comets provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The livestream will continue to provide updates and imagery of 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, allowing astronomers and enthusiasts alike to track its progress.</p>
