      <h2>China’s Tianwen-1 probe captures rare images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in orbit around Mars</h2>

<p>The Tianwen-1 probe, operated by the China National Space Administration, has captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS while in orbit around Mars between October 1 and 4, 2025. The comet, discovered in July 2025, is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the Solar System, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it contributes to global studies on these rare celestial bodies. The data, released on November 5, showcases the collaboration among various space agencies, including NASA and ESA, which redirected their probes on Mars for similar observations during the comet’s passage.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Capture occurred 30 million kilometers away from Mars.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has a central core estimated at 5.6 km in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of 58 km/s during its approach.</li>
    <li>Images reveal a bright core surrounded by a diffuse coma of gas and dust.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits a composition rich in water ice and carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA's ExoMars TGO participated in coordinated observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. NASA confirmed its hyperbolic orbit shortly after. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025, reaching a distance of 1.4 astronomical units, which is within Mars' orbit. Observations from Hubble in July indicated a faint tail that grew to 30 arcseconds by August. The Tianwen-1 probe began technical preparations for the observation in September 2025.</p>

<p>During the observation period, the Tianwen-1 team conducted simulations to adjust for the comet's low luminosity, which is 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than the Martian surface. They made necessary adjustments for thermal control and orbital stability to capture the comet's movement against the stellar background.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This observation serves as a test of soft target tracking capabilities, benefiting future missions,” a spokesperson for the China National Space Administration stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Tianwen-1 mission was launched in July 2020 and successfully entered Martian orbit in February 2021. The Zhurong rover, which landed in May 2021, operated for about a year, collecting soil samples and geological images. The successful capture of comet 3I/ATLAS highlights the advancements in tracking capabilities and the international collaboration in studying celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The experience gained from observing 3I/ATLAS will support the upcoming Tianwen-2 mission, launched in May 2025, which aims to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid. Navigation tests validated during the comet capture will enhance future exploration efforts.</p>
