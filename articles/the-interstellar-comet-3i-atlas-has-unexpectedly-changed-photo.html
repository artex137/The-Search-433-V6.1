      <h2>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has unexpectedly changed — photo</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown significant changes in shape and emission as it travels through the solar system, according to observations collected by the SPHEREx space telescope. These observations occurred in August and December of last year, with results recently published on the preprint server arXiv.</p>

<p>This discovery is important for researchers studying the composition and behavior of comets. The data reveals how various substances are distributed around 3I/ATLAS's nucleus, providing insights into its physical characteristics and evolution. Authorities, including scientists from IFLScience, have emphasized that this analysis is preliminary and further investigation is needed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observations conducted by: SPHEREx space telescope</li>
    <li>Observation periods: August and December of last year</li>
    <li>Publication: Data available on the preprint server arXiv</li>
    <li>Composition includes: water, nitrides, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide</li>
    <li>Key finding: Dust structure is asymmetrical, forming an anti-tail</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August and December of last year, the SPHEREx space telescope collected data on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The analysis of these measurements has revealed significant changes in the comet's shape and the distribution of various substances around its nucleus.</p>

<p>Researchers have noted that the ice around the comet consists of multiple molecules, with a spherical distribution overall. However, the distribution of hydrocarbons is less spherical, showing slight flattening, while the dust structure exhibits asymmetry.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is not a complete analysis of the December data. However, it already shows how much 3I/ATLAS has changed during its passage through the solar system,” scientists from IFLScience stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations of comets have often focused on their tail formations and chemical compositions. The data from SPHEREx adds to the existing body of knowledge regarding the behavior of interstellar objects as they interact with solar radiation and other forces in the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the December data is anticipated, which may provide more comprehensive insights into the changes occurring in 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>
