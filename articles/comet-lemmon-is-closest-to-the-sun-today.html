      <h2>Comet Lemmon is closest to the sun today</h2>

<p>Comet Lemmon (C/2025 A6) reaches its closest point to the sun on November 8, 2025, at approximately 49 million miles (79 million km) from the sun. It is currently visible from dark-sky locations in the Northern Hemisphere, although it has recently faded in brightness.</p>

<p>The visibility of Comet Lemmon is significant for amateur astronomers and enthusiasts. Astronomers say it has been the best comet of 2025, making it a valuable opportunity for observation before it moves further away from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: October 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: November 8, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the sun at perihelion: 49 million miles (79 million km)</li>
    <li>Current location: In front of the constellation Ophiuchus</li>
    <li>Brightness: Approximately magnitude 4 at its peak</li>
    <li>Discovered: January 3, 2025, using the 60-inch telescope at Mt. Lemmon, Arizona</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon has been observed since its discovery in January 2025. It reached its closest point to Earth on October 21, 2025, and is now approaching its perihelion on November 8, 2025. The comet has moved progressively southward in the sky, currently located in front of the large dim constellation Ophiuchus.</p>

<p>During October, it was near the Big Dipper, aiding observers in locating it. However, it has since drifted away from that constellation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet Lemmon has favored Northern Hemisphere observers and has been a good target even for beginning observers,” according to reports from astronomers.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon is just one of several comets currently visible in the sky. The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was closest to the sun in late October 2025, and another comet, C/2025 R2 (SWAN), is becoming more visible but requires optical aid for observation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet Lemmon continues its orbit, astronomers will monitor its visibility and brightness. Observers are encouraged to use binoculars for the best view as it nears the sun.</p>
