      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery Deepens: Avi Loeb Detects 12 Anomaly As Comet 'Doesn't Behave' Naturally</h2>

<p>The comet known as 3I/ATLAS has displayed a twelfth unexplained anomaly in its movement, according to a recent report by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The discovery adds to the comet's already complex behaviours as it travels through our solar system, with its closest approach to the Sun occurring on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it challenges existing knowledge about interstellar objects. Scientists have noted that 3I/ATLAS does not follow the predictable patterns typical of comets from our solar system. The ongoing investigation aims to gather as much information as possible about the comet before it moves beyond observational range.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is travelling at speeds up to <strong>246,000 kilometres per hour</strong> (153,000 miles per hour).</li>
    <li>The comet reached its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, on <strong>October 29, 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has documented a total of <strong>12 anomalies</strong> in the comet's behaviour.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits a hyperbolic orbital eccentricity of <strong>6.139</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest pass near Earth in <strong>mid-December 2025</strong>, approximately <strong>270 million kilometres</strong> away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the solar system on an unidentified path, displaying unusual behaviours from the outset. Avi Loeb has been tracking the comet for several months, noting deviations in its brightness, speed, and direction. Each anomaly has added to the mystery surrounding the object, prompting further investigation.</p>
<p>The most recent anomaly was identified by Loeb, marking the twelfth unexplained behaviour observed in the comet's trajectory. This ongoing study underscores the significance of interstellar objects in understanding phenomena beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Something is happening with 3I/ATLAS that scientists cannot yet fully explain,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the comet's unique composition and behaviour.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, other interstellar objects like 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov were observed, but 3I/ATLAS exhibits significantly different characteristics. Its behaviours challenge current theories about how such celestial bodies should act, raising questions about the physical laws governing them.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are focused on collecting detailed data about 3I/ATLAS before it moves out of reach. The next significant observation opportunity will occur in mid-December 2025, when the comet passes near Earth, allowing scientists to learn more about its origins and characteristics.</p>
