      <h2>ESA pinpoints 3I/ATLAS’s path with data from Mars</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has improved the predicted trajectory of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, using data from its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) spacecraft orbiting Mars. This advancement comes after astronomers began tracking the comet following its discovery on 1 July 2025. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This enhancement in trajectory prediction is significant as it demonstrates the potential for using observations from Mars to refine the paths of interstellar objects. ESA has stated that the new data allows astronomers to aim their instruments more accurately, facilitating detailed scientific studies of 3I/ATLAS before it exits the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars occurred on 3 October 2025, at approximately 30 million km.</li>
    <li>Data from ExoMars TGO was collected between 1 and 7 October 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>The accuracy of the predicted trajectory improved by a factor of 10.</li>
    <li>Data has been officially submitted to the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. Astronomers began tracking its trajectory using Earth-based telescopes. Between 1 and 7 October 2025, ESA’s ExoMars TGO observed the comet from Mars, significantly improving its predicted location. The closest approach to Mars occurred on 3 October 2025, allowing the spacecraft to gather critical data that enhanced trajectory predictions.</p>

<p>This marked the first time astrometric measurements from a spacecraft in orbit around another planet have been officially accepted into the MPC database, demonstrating a new method for tracking interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This exercise with 3I/ATLAS has shown the value of triangulating data from Earth with observations from a second location in space,” said an ESA representative. “It demonstrates the importance of utilizing various resources for planetary defence.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, trajectory observations of comets and asteroids predominantly relied on fixed observatories on Earth. The successful use of Mars-based data represents a significant advancement in planetary defence strategies. ESA routinely monitors near-Earth objects, and this event serves as a rehearsal for future scenarios where precise trajectory calculations may be crucial.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA is currently observing 3I/ATLAS with its Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) spacecraft, although it is positioned farther from the comet than the Mars orbiter. Data from Juice's observations is expected to be available in February 2026. Additionally, ESA is preparing the Neomir mission to detect near-Earth objects that may approach from the Sun's direction.</p>
