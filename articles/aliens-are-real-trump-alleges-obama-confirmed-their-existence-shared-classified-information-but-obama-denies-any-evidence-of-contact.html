      <h2>Trump Alleges Obama Leaked Classified Alien Information, Obama Denies Evidence</h2>

<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Barack Obama of revealing classified information about extraterrestrial life during a podcast appearance on Thursday. Trump made the comments aboard Air Force One, stating that Obama's remarks constituted a "big mistake" and breached security protocols. The exchange comes amid a surge in reported unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) sightings, with over 750 reports logged between May 2023 and June 2024.</p>

<p>This situation is significant as it reignites public interest in UFO theories and allegations of government cover-ups. The Pentagon has recorded numerous UAP incidents, prompting discussions about national security and the need for stigma-free reporting on such matters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump accused Obama of leaking classified information about aliens.</li>
    <li>Obama stated statistically there is a likelihood of life elsewhere but no evidence of contact.</li>
    <li>Over 750 UAP sightings have been reported from May 2023 to June 2024.</li>
    <li>Trump's remarks were made aboard Air Force One on Thursday.</li>
    <li>Obama participated in a podcast interview with Brian Tyler Cohen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2023, reports of UAP sightings began to increase, culminating in over 750 incidents by June 2024. On Thursday, Trump spoke aboard Air Force One, criticizing Obama for discussing classified information regarding aliens. Later that day, Obama appeared on a podcast where he joked about the existence of aliens while clarifying that no evidence of extraterrestrial life surfaced during his presidency.</p>

<p>Obama's comments sparked a media frenzy, with many interpreting his remarks as a casual acknowledgment of the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe, despite lacking proof.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He leaked classified information. He's not supposed to do that,” Trump said regarding Obama’s remarks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“They're real but I haven't seen them,” Obama quipped on the podcast, denying any knowledge of Area 51 cover-ups.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Statistically, life is likely to be there but it is unlikely that people will visit because of distance,” Obama later stated on Instagram.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent interest in UFOs follows a series of Pentagon hearings aimed at destigmatizing reports of UAPs, which officials regard as potential national security threats. Declassified CIA documents from 2013 revealed that Area 51 had conducted experiments on U-2 spy planes, which contributed to earlier UFO sightings but did not indicate the presence of extraterrestrial craft. Obama has consistently dismissed conspiracy theories regarding underground bases and alien storage.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions continue, officials are likely to push for further investigations into UAP incidents. The ongoing debate surrounding the existence of extraterrestrial life and government transparency is expected to remain a topic of public interest and scrutiny.</p>
