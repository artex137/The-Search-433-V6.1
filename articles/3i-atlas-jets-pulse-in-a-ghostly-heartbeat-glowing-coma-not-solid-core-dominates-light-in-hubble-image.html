      <h2>3I/Atlas Jets Pulse in a Ghostly Heartbeat: Glowing Coma, Not Solid Core, Dominates Light in Hubble Image</h2>

<p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, designated 3I/ATLAS, which was detected on 1 July 2025. This object exhibits a unique pulsing light pattern, observed to vary every 16.16 hours, as confirmed by data from the Hubble Space Telescope on 21 July 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about the nature of celestial objects. Scientists are currently analyzing the light emitted by 3I/ATLAS, which appears to originate from a glowing coma rather than a solid core, prompting further investigation into the object's characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of detection:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Hubble image:</strong> 21 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Pulsation period:</strong> 16.16 hours</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated radius of nucleus:</strong> approximately 2.8 kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Outflow velocity of jets:</strong> 440 metres per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Initial observations indicated a rhythmic light pattern, leading to theories about its elongated shape. Further analysis revealed that the light is primarily emitted from a surrounding coma.</p>

<p>By 21 July 2025, images from the Hubble Space Telescope showed that the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is not the primary source of light. Instead, the glowing coma complicates the understanding of the object's size and brightness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>A deeper analysis suggests that relating this variability merely to the shape of the nucleus is a mistake. The periodicity is undeniable, but its cause appears to be far more ethereal.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the detection of 3I/ATLAS, interstellar objects were largely theoretical. The unique characteristics of this object, particularly its pulsing jets, provide new insights into the dynamics of comets and other celestial phenomena. Understanding these jets could advance knowledge about the formation and evolution of similar objects in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to conduct further observations to determine the nature of the jets emitted by 3I/ATLAS. A systematic study of its light variations over time could clarify whether the jets are of natural origin or related to technological processes.</p>
