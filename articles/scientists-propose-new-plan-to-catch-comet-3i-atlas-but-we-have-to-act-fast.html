      <h2>Scientists propose new plan to 'catch' comet 3I/ATLAS — but we have to act fast</h2>

<p>A team of researchers has proposed a new plan to intercept comet 3I/ATLAS, which is rapidly moving away from the solar system. The proposal, led by Adam Hibberd from the Initiative for Interstellar Studies, outlines a mission that would launch in 2035 and utilize a Solar Oberth maneuver to catch the comet before it leaves Earth's vicinity.</p>

<p>This mission matters because 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever detected, and studying it could provide groundbreaking insights into the composition of such celestial bodies. Current proposals have faced challenges due to the comet's high speed and late detection, which complicates direct rendezvous missions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected after it had already traveled inside the orbit of Jupiter.</li>
    <li>It is currently moving at a speed exceeding <strong>60 km/s</strong>.</li>
    <li>Proposed launch date for the new mission is <strong>2035</strong>.</li>
    <li>The flight duration to intercept 3I/ATLAS would be approximately <strong>50 years</strong>.</li>
    <li>The research paper has been accepted for publication in the <strong>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</strong>.</li>
    <li>The study was co-authored by T. Marshall Eubanks and Andreas Hein.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected after it had already passed the optimal launch window for a direct mission. The researchers determined that the comet's high heliocentric speed and late detection effectively ruled out direct rendezvous missions.</p>
<p>In response, Hibberd and his team utilized the Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory Software (OITS) to explore indirect mission options. They concluded that a launch in 2035 could allow for a successful intercept using the Solar Oberth maneuver.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “For the direct mission, the object 3I/ATLAS was detected too late, when it had already travelled inside the orbit of Jupiter, and with a velocity in excess of 60 km/s,” said Hibberd. “It turns out, this was after the optimal launch date for a direct mission to intercept it.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects have been detected. The previous missions to intercept such objects have relied on chemical rockets, with proposals like NASA's Janus mission and the European Space Agency's Comet Interceptor focusing on existing technologies. The challenges presented by 3I/ATLAS highlight the need for innovative mission planning in the field of space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The researchers plan to further refine their proposal and conduct simulations to ensure the feasibility of the 2035 launch. They aim to secure support from relevant space agencies to turn their plans into reality.</p>
