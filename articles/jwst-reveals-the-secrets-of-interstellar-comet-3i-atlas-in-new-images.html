      <h2>JWST Reveals the Secrets of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS in New Images</h2>
<p>On August 26, 2025, astronomers announced new findings about interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has provided unprecedented insights into the comet's chemical composition, revealing significant differences from typical comets in our solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is crucial as it expands our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. The findings indicate that 3I/ATLAS is formed under conditions distinct from those in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud, marking it as a unique case among known interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
  <li>JWST conducted observations on August 6, 2025.</li>
  <li>The comet is estimated to have a nucleus size between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
  <li>Carbon dioxide (CO2) dominates the comet's coma, with a mixing ratio of approximately 8 to 1 compared to water vapor.</li>
  <li>The comet will reach its closest approach to the Sun in late October 2025.</li>
  <li>It will pass Earth at a distance of roughly 1.8 astronomical units (AU).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers using the ATLAS survey in Chile discovered a faint moving object, which was later confirmed as comet 3I/ATLAS. By July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the comet, revealing a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust around its nucleus. This prompted an international observing campaign, leading to further observations by NASA's Swift Observatory.</p>
<p>On August 6, 2025, JWST focused on 3I/ATLAS, utilizing its Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) to analyze the comet's coma and uncover its chemical makeup.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The findings from JWST indicate that 3I/ATLAS possesses a unique composition, suggesting it formed in a very different environment than our local comets,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These previous discoveries have reshaped our understanding of the dynamics and characteristics of objects from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will monitor its activity and gather more data before it exits the solar system. The comet's closest approach to the Sun will occur in late October 2025, providing an opportunity for further observations.</p>
