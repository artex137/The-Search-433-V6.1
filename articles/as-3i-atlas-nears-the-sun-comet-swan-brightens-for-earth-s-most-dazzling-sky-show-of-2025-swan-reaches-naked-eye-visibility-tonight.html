      <h2>Comet SWAN Brightens for Earth’s Most Dazzling Sky Show of 2025</h2>

<p>Comet SWAN (C/2025 R2) has reached binocular visibility as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach set for October 20–21, 2025. The comet was discovered by an amateur astronomer mid-September 2025 while analyzing data from NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the closest approach of any major comet since early 2025. Authorities have noted the potential for SWAN to reach naked-eye visibility under optimal dark-sky conditions during its closest approach, making it a noteworthy spectacle for both amateur and professional astronomers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet SWAN was discovered in mid-September 2025.</li>
    <li>It will pass at a distance of 0.27 astronomical units (approximately 40 million kilometers) from Earth.</li>
    <li>Closest approach is expected on October 20–21, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's brightness may reach naked-eye visibility under dark-sky conditions.</li>
    <li>SWAN has shown rapid brightening, moving from telescope visibility to binocular visibility in about 14 days.</li>
    <li>The comet poses no hazard to Earth or satellites.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In mid-September 2025, an amateur astronomer discovered Comet SWAN while reviewing data from NASA's SOHO spacecraft. Following its identification, the comet exhibited rapid brightening, transitioning from invisible to binocular-visible in approximately 14 days. The comet is now on a trajectory to make its closest approach to Earth on October 20–21, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“SWAN has demonstrated extraordinary brightening behavior as solar radiation vaporizes surface ice, creating a luminous coma and tail,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of Comet SWAN mirrors the detection of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which was also identified through crowdsourced observation methods. Both comets highlight the contributions of citizen scientists in astronomical discoveries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will continue to monitor its brightness and trajectory. Observers are encouraged to use binoculars or small telescopes to achieve the best views, especially in areas with high light pollution.</p>
