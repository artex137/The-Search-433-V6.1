      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Surprises Scientists with Jets Aimed at the Sun</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed unusual jets emanating from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, located approximately 326 million km from Earth, with a close approach expected on December 19, 2025. Two British astronomers, Frank Niebling and Michael Buchner, captured detailed images of the comet between 5:08 and 5:22 UT on November 9, 2025, revealing three main jets, including two directed toward the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which some researchers speculate could be an artificial object rather than a typical comet. According to Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, the characteristics of the jets may indicate technological thrusters or natural gas emissions from the comet's surface. Upcoming studies with spectroscopic instruments aim to clarify these findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 326 million km from Earth.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, at 269 million km.</li>
    <li>The jets were photographed between 5:08 and 5:22 UT on November 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>The tail of 3I/ATLAS measures about 2.85 million km long.</li>
    <li>The sunward jets extend approximately 0.95 million km.</li>
    <li>The jets are reportedly a thousand times larger than those observed by the Hubble Space Telescope in July.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 8, 2025, initial images revealed around seven bright jets emanating from 3I/ATLAS. The following day, Niebling and Buchner captured detailed photographs of these jets, leading to further analysis by scientists.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has noted that the jets could either be caused by pockets of ice on the comet’s surface or could indicate the presence of thrusters similar to those used for spacecraft navigation. He stated, “Is the network of jets associated with pockets of ice on the surface of a natural cometary nucleus or are they coming from a set of jet thrusters used for navigation of a spacecraft? We do not know.”</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “For a normal comet, gas usually escapes at only 0.4 km per second. The jets must have been blowing for one to three months to grow this large,” said Loeb, emphasizing the unusual characteristics of the jets from 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the second known interstellar object after Oumuamua, which was observed in 2017. The unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS has led scientists to consider whether it follows the patterns of a typical comet or represents a new category of celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Upcoming studies using spectroscopic instruments are expected to analyze the jets' speed, composition, and strength, which could provide definitive answers regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS. As of now, no spacecraft can reach or study the jets directly due to their distance.</p>
