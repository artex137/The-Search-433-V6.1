      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: A Rare Visitor from Beyond the Solar System</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet designated 3I/ATLAS, discovered in early 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey in Chile, is on track to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. This marks only the third confirmed interstellar object to traverse our solar system, with no reported injuries or fatalities associated with its passage.</p>

<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS is significant for astronomers and scientists, as it provides a unique opportunity to study an object from outside our solar system. Agencies such as NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are closely monitoring its trajectory and behavior to gather data that could enhance our understanding of distant stellar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> Early 2025 by ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Perigee:</strong> Approximately 1.8 astronomical units (AU), or about 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> Approximately 244,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> Expected to reach around 11.0</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Constellation Leo, right ascension 10h 57m 21s, declination +06° 06’ 56”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in the summer of 2025, following its hyperbolic trajectory that confirms its interstellar origin. It passed perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, earlier this year, experiencing intense solar heating that caused sublimation of its ices. Recent tracking data has shown minor deviations in its trajectory, attributed to natural outgassing.</p>

<p>On December 3, 2025, ESA's XMM-Newton X-ray observatory captured the comet glowing in low-energy X-rays, providing insights into its volatile composition. Ground-based telescopes, including Gemini North, have observed changes in its color due to the release of gases.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This event serves as an opportunity to test planetary defense protocols,” said a NASA spokesperson. “We treat the comet as a non-hazardous analog for potential future interstellar visitors.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following previous discoveries that have helped scientists understand the characteristics of such bodies. Unlike comets from the Oort Cloud, interstellar comets provide rare insights into the composition and formation of exoplanetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, astronomers will continue to gather data that may reveal more about its nucleus size and unique materials. The best observation period will occur around December 19, before the comet fades and exits interstellar space.</p>
