      <h2>Why decades of UFO research is sitting in a Vancouver warehouse</h2>

<p>A collection of decades of research material on UFOs and alleged extraterrestrial encounters is set to be auctioned off in Vancouver next month. The collection, which includes declassified government documents, has been stored at Direct Liquidation in East Vancouver. Jeff Schwarz, the owner, has described the shipment as one of the most unusual collections he has ever handled.</p>

<p>This auction matters as it offers a glimpse into extensive research on UFO phenomena and could attract interest from production companies looking to continue investigations into the subject. Chris Wyatt, the collection’s original owner, is a California producer who has created multiple documentaries on UFOs since the 1990s. He hopes the material will be acquired by someone who can continue exploring its contents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Collection includes thousands of pages of documents, interviews, and photographs.</li>
    <li>Original owner Chris Wyatt gathered the material during his work in the 1990s.</li>
    <li>Notable item includes a confiscated yearbook from Roswell Air Force Base, dated 1947.</li>
    <li>Wyatt expects the yearbook to sell for at least <strong>$100,000</strong> at auction.</li>
    <li>Collection will be auctioned off next month at Direct Liquidation in East Vancouver.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the 1940s, the military ordered the destruction of yearbooks from Roswell Air Force Base, following an alleged UFO crash. In the 1990s, Chris Wyatt began compiling a vast collection of UFO-related materials for his documentaries. The collection has since been stored at Direct Liquidation in Vancouver, where it is now set to be auctioned next month.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’ve been doing this for 40 years, I get all kinds of stuff. Getting something like this – I would say it’s probably in the top one, if not the top one,”</blockquote> said Jeff Schwarz, owner of Direct Liquidation.

<blockquote>“This gentleman was on an oxygen tank. He said, ‘I don’t have long to live. This is my prized possession, and I think you’re the guy to own it,’”</blockquote> Wyatt recalled about acquiring the rare yearbook from a former officer.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Vancouver has a long association with UFO lore, notably serving as a filming location for the popular television series The X-Files. The city's history with UFO sightings has led to a culture where many residents have personal stories about their encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The collection is expected to go to auction next month, with hopes that a production company will purchase it to continue the investigation into UFO phenomena.</p>
