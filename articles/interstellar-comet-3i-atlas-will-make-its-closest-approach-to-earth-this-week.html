      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas will make its closest approach to Earth this week</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, passing within 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) of the planet. Discovered in July, the comet is expected to be visible to backyard astronomers as it fades on its exit from the solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar comet to traverse our solar system. NASA is actively observing the comet with its space telescopes, although the comet is diminishing in brightness. According to NASA's acting administrator Sean Duffy, the comet poses no threat to Earth and is of interest because of its origins beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will pass within 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) of Earth on Friday.</li>
    <li>Estimated size of the comet is between 1,444 feet (440 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers).</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) team in July.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar comet to be identified in our solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will pass much closer to Jupiter in March, at a distance of 33 million miles (53 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>It is expected to reach interstellar space in the mid-2030s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered the comet 3I/Atlas in July 2023 while conducting surveys for potentially hazardous asteroids. Since then, NASA has monitored the comet’s trajectory and brightness as it approaches Earth.</p>

<p>In October, Sean Duffy commented on the comet, clarifying its origins and naming convention, stating, “3 = the third, I = interstellar, meaning from beyond our solar system, ATLAS = discovered by our Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) team.”</p>

<p>The comet will continue its journey, coming significantly closer to Jupiter in March 2024 before heading into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth.”</blockquote>
<p>— Sean Duffy, acting NASA administrator</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is part of a small group of interstellar objects that have entered our solar system. The first confirmed interstellar visitor was discovered in 2017, followed by another in 2019 spotted by a Crimean amateur astronomer. Unlike comets from our solar system, such as Halley's Comet, interstellar comets originate from star systems outside of our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to observe 3I/Atlas as it approaches and exits the solar system. The comet's trajectory will be monitored until it reaches interstellar space, which is anticipated to occur in the mid-2030s.</p>
