      <h2>Juice Spacecraft Set to Observe Rare Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) has diverted its focus to the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which is currently passing through our solar system. Launched in 2023, Juice is on an eight-year mission to study Jupiter and its moons but will now also observe 3I/Atlas as it approaches the sun.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/Atlas represents only the third recorded interstellar object to enter our solar system. Scientists aim to gain insights into the composition and origins of such comets, which could enhance our understanding of other planetary systems. The ESA has activated five of Juice's instruments to collect data on this unique celestial body.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Juice was launched by the European Space Agency in 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is traveling at approximately <strong>220,000 kilometers per hour</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet measures about <strong>2.6 kilometers</strong> in diameter.</li>
    <li>It approached within <strong>210 million kilometers</strong> of the sun by late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Five of Juice's instruments have been activated for the observation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Last summer, astronomers identified comet 3I/Atlas as it entered our solar system. This marked a notable event as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object to do so. Juice, initially focused on Jupiter, has adapted its mission to observe this comet.</p>

<p>By late October 2025, 3I/Atlas had made its closest approach to the sun, prompting the ESA to activate multiple instruments on Juice for data collection. The spacecraft has been designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the outer solar system but had to adjust to increased solar radiation near the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This opportunity is a gift for planetary scientists,” said Paul Hartogh, principal investigator of Juice's Submillimetre Wave Instrument. “Comets are time capsules, preserving the chemical signatures from their formation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The first confirmed interstellar visitor, 1I/ʻOumuamua, passed through in 2017 but lacked typical cometary features. In contrast, 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019, exhibited standard comet characteristics, providing crucial data for scientists studying materials from other star systems. The observation of 3I/Atlas adds to the growing list of interstellar objects entering our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Data collected from Juice's instruments is currently being processed, with results expected to be released soon. Scientists anticipate that interstellar visitors may become more frequent as detection technologies advance, marking a new era in astronomical observation.</p>
