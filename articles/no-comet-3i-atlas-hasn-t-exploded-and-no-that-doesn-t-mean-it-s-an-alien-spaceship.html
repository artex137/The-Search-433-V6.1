      <h2>No, comet 3I/ATLAS hasn't exploded — and no, that doesn't mean it's an alien spaceship</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS remains intact and has not exploded after its recent perihelion, or closest approach to the sun, on October 29. Reports suggesting the comet broke apart have been clarified by experts, including a postdoctoral fellow at the Lowell Observatory, Qicheng Zhang, who stated that all observations indicate the comet is healthy.</p>

<p>This clarification is significant as it addresses public concern and speculation regarding the comet's nature. Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July, is only the third interstellar comet recorded and may provide valuable insights into the early solar system. Astronomers continue to monitor the comet closely as it rises higher in the eastern sky, with observations expected to reveal more about its composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29.</li>
    <li>Recent observations on November 9 show no signs of fragmentation.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Lowell Observatory, has assessed the comet's condition.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has faced criticism for claims about the comet being an alien spacecraft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, Comet 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, passing close to the sun. Following this event, it briefly disappeared behind the sun and re-emerged, prompting a flurry of speculation regarding its condition.</p>
<p>On November 9, observations from two small telescopes in Spain indicated that jets were emitting from the comet. This led to claims by Avi Loeb that the comet had lost significant mass and might have fragmented. However, subsequent assessments by astronomers, including Qicheng Zhang, have confirmed that the comet appears normal and intact.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All the images I've seen show a fairly ordinary/healthy-looking comet. There's no sign at all that the nucleus broke apart,” said Qicheng Zhang.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“In these papers and on his blog he regularly betrays an unfamiliarity with well-established planetary science concepts,” stated Jason T Wright, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State University, criticizing Loeb's claims.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked significant interest since its discovery. The comet is thought to be over 7 billion years old and is the most massive interstellar comet recorded. Previous claims regarding the comet's nature, particularly by Avi Loeb, have drawn widespread scrutiny from the scientific community, with many astronomers asserting its natural origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue as it approaches Earth on December 19. Astronomers expect to gather more data to further understand the comet's characteristics and dismiss any unfounded claims regarding its nature.</p>
