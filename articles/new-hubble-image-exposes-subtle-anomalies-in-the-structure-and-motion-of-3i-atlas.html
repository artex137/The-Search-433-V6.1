      <h2>New Hubble Image Exposes Subtle Anomalies In The Structure and Motion of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured a new image of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, taken on December 27, 2025, during a 170-second exposure. The raw observational data reveals unexpected asymmetries in the object's structure and motion, which could impact scientific understanding of its behavior.</p>

<p>This latest image is significant as it offers unprocessed data, preserving details that may be lost in enhanced imagery. Researchers are examining the implications of the findings for planetary defense models and the classification of fast-moving interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: December 27, 2025</li>
    <li>Duration of exposure: 170 seconds</li>
    <li>Instrument used: Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 UVIS detector</li>
    <li>Filter: Broad F350LP filter at visible wavelengths</li>
    <li>Analysis by: Avi Loeb</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 27, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured a raw image of 3I/ATLAS, highlighting unique features in its structure. Prior observations in July and November showed a jet-like emission from the object, which is now corroborated by the December image.</p>
<p>The analysis of the image indicates that the object displays directional venting rather than passive outgassing, suggesting organized activity. This finding builds on previous research that noted a long, narrow jet associated with the object's motion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This image functions like a contemporaneous photograph in an evidentiary record. It corroborates earlier findings without overstating them,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The same directional biases, compact emission, and asymmetric structure seen across multiple months remain present here,” Loeb added, emphasizing the significance of the new data.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior images of 3I/ATLAS indicated a jet roughly ten times longer than it was wide, with a measurable wobble. The December frame provides additional evidence of this jet's presence, which has important implications for understanding the object's behavior as it moves through space.</p>
<p>The ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS are crucial as they challenge standard comet models and raise questions about the object's composition and structural integrity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze new frames of 3I/ATLAS as they become available, aiming to clarify the object's characteristics and refine planetary defense models accordingly.</p>
