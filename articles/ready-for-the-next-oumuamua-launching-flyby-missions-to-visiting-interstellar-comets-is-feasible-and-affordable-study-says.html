      <h2>Ready for the next 'Oumuamua? Launching flyby missions to visiting interstellar comets is 'feasible and affordable,' study says</h2>

<p>A new study has found that launching flyby missions to interstellar comets, such as Comet 3I ATLAS, is both feasible and affordable. The study was published recently, emphasizing the potential for future exploration of these celestial visitors.</p>

<p>This research holds significant implications for space agencies as they consider the logistics and costs associated with interstellar missions. The findings suggest that with current technology, it is possible to send spacecraft to study these comets, which can provide valuable insights into the origins of our solar system and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study published recently; details on the publication date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Focuses on Comet 3I ATLAS, which is classified as an interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>Study evaluates the feasibility and affordability of launching flyby missions.</li>
    <li>Research suggests current technology can support such missions.</li>
    <li>Potential implications for future exploration by space agencies globally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The study's findings have emerged as interest in interstellar objects has grown, particularly following the discovery of Comet 3I ATLAS. Researchers have been examining the possibilities for future missions to these comets, assessing the technology and costs involved.</p>

<p>Prior to this study, various missions have been proposed but not yet executed, with agencies considering the benefits of exploring these distant objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The exploration of interstellar comets like 3I ATLAS opens new avenues for understanding our universe,” said a lead researcher involved in the study. “We believe that with the right investment, these missions are achievable.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study aligns with growing interest in interstellar exploration, particularly following the detection of objects like 'Oumuamua in 2017. This incident sparked discussions about the potential for missions to study such objects more closely.</p>

<p>Space agencies have increasingly focused on advancing technology to enable deep-space exploration, making this study a timely contribution to ongoing conversations in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the publication of the study, space agencies are expected to evaluate the findings and consider potential missions to interstellar comets, with specific plans and timelines yet to be disclosed.</p>
