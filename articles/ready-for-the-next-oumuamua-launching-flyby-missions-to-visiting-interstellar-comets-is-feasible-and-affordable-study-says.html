      <h2>Ready for the next 'Oumuamua: Flyby missions to interstellar comets 'feasible and affordable'</h2>

<p>Scientists at the Southwest Research Institute (SWRI) have stated that flyby missions to interstellar comets, such as 3I/ATLAS, are “feasible and affordable.” The findings were released in a study on September 3, 2023. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this project.</p>

<p>The study highlights the potential for future missions to collect data on interstellar objects. Current technology may allow for spacecraft to fly by these cosmic visitors, providing insights into their composition and properties. SWRI emphasizes the need to prepare for these missions now to enhance our understanding of solid body formation processes in other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study released on September 3, 2023, by SWRI</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li>Interstellar objects can pass within the orbit of Earth annually</li>
    <li>New surveyors like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory may increase interstellar discoveries</li>
    <li>SWRI's mission concept has not been submitted for NASA funding</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, 1I/'Oumuamua was the first interstellar object identified in our solar system. This was followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019. On September 3, 2023, SWRI announced that they have developed a plan for a mission to study interstellar comets, including 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is within the interceptable range of the mission we designed,” said Matthew Freeman, project manager and director of space instrumentation at SWRI.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Flybys would give unprecedented insights into the composition, structure and properties of these objects,” said Alan Stern, SWRI associate vice president and leader of the study project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It doesn't take anything harder than the technologies and launch performance [for] missions that NASA has already flown,” said Mark Tapely, an orbital mechanics specialist at SWRI.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects have been challenging to identify. However, SWRI reported that “numerous” objects pass inside Earth's orbit each year. As many as 10,000 may approach within Neptune's orbit, which is about 30 times farther from the sun than Earth. The advancements in detection capabilities could lead to more frequent discoveries of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>SWRI plans to continue developing the mission concept, although it has not yet been proposed to NASA for funding. The ongoing analysis of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will help refine future mission parameters.</p>
