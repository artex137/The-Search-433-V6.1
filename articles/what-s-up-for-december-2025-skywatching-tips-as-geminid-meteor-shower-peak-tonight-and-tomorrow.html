      <h2>What's Up for December 2025? Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth</h2>

<p>BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA – Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, providing an opportunity for skywatchers to observe this interstellar object.</p>

<p>This event is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third object from outside our solar system to be discovered within it. NASA is actively monitoring the comet with various spacecraft and telescopes, aiming to gather information while it is in proximity to Earth. Authorities have confirmed that the comet poses no threat, remaining approximately 170 million miles away during its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
<li>Distance at closest approach: 170 million miles (more than 700 times the distance between Earth and the Moon)</li>
<li>Observation conditions: Best viewed with a telescope of at least 30 centimeters aperture</li>
<li>Location for viewing: East to northeast sky, under the star Regulus in the constellation Leo</li>
<li>Geminid meteor shower peak: December 13-14, 2025</li>
<li>Potential visibility during Geminids: Up to 120 meteors per hour</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been tracked since its discovery, and it will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19. The Geminid meteor shower is currently active, with its peak occurring on the evenings of December 13 and 14. Observers are encouraged to view the meteors in the eastern sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA continues to observe and study the object using a variety of spacecraft and telescopes so we can learn as much as we can about it while it’s in our solar neighborhood,” a NASA spokesperson said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of the few interstellar objects identified within our solar system. Its appearance adds to the excitement of the December skywatching events, including the annual Geminid meteor shower, which is known for its bright and colorful displays.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, skywatchers are encouraged to participate in local observatory events and skywatching activities. Observations will continue to be reported by NASA as they gather more data on the comet.</p>
