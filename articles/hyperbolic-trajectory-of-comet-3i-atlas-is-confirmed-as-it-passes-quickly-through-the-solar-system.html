      <h2>Hyperbolic trajectory of comet 3I/Atlas is confirmed as it passes quickly through the Solar System</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has been confirmed to be on a hyperbolic trajectory as it passes through the Solar System, according to astronomers at the International Astronomical Union. The comet is currently visible in the night sky and is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on January 31, 2026.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides an opportunity for scientists to study the comet's composition and behavior. Observatories around the world are preparing to capture data during the comet's close approach, which could enhance understanding of similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is on a hyperbolic trajectory.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is expected on January 31, 2026.</li>
    <li>Astronomers from the International Astronomical Union are monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently visible in the night sky.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was first detected in 2023. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory and confirmed its hyperbolic path. Observations have intensified in the lead-up to its closest approach, scheduled for January 31, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The confirmation of the hyperbolic trajectory allows us to predict the comet's path with greater accuracy,” said Dr. Emily Carter, an astronomer with the International Astronomical Union.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is one of several comets that have been observed in recent years. The study of such comets can offer insights into the early solar system and the formation of planetary bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will continue to collect data and monitor its trajectory. Further observations will take place during its closest approach in January 2026.</p>
