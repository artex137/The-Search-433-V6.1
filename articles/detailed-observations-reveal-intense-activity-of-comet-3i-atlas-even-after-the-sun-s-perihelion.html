      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Shows Intense Activity Post-Perihelion</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has continued to exhibit significant activity nearly three weeks after its closest approach to the Sun on November 17, 2025. Observations from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, have revealed an asymmetrical coma and a tail extending for millions of kilometers, according to renowned astrophotographer Efrain Morales.</p>

<p>This ongoing activity is important for the scientific community as it provides insights into the composition and behaviour of interstellar objects. Experts are leveraging the data gathered to enhance understanding of planetary formation and the diversity of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to the Sun on November 17, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently travelling at approximately 221,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The nucleus diameter is estimated to be between 5 and 11 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Recent observations have shown a coma larger than 56,000 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet has been monitored by multiple agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA).</li>
    <li>It remains visible to medium-sized amateur telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 2-25, 2025, the European Space Agency's JUICE mission collected data on Comet 3I/ATLAS. Observations from Gemini Sul observatory in Chile on November 3 revealed a significant coma. A detailed image was captured by Efrain Morales in Aguadilla on November 17, showcasing the comet's features.</p>

<p>Prior to these significant observations, the Tianwen-1 telescope recorded sequences of the comet in October 2025 when it was approximately 30 million kilometers from Mars. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter detected a halo of gas around the nucleus on October 2, 2025, further contributing to the understanding of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The sharpness of the image allowed astronomers to observe crucial morphological details that indicate the continuity of sublimation processes at its core,” said Efrain Morales.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “This rare phenomenon provides a window into conditions in other star systems, helping to expand understanding of planetary formation,” a representative from NASA stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is recognized as the third interstellar object confirmed within our solar system. It follows the detection of 2I/Borisov in 2019. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its hyperbolic trajectory and ongoing gas and dust release, set it apart from other comets.</p>

<p>The comet’s activity is being monitored closely due to its potential implications for planetary science and the understanding of volatile materials in interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to analyze data collected from various observations and missions to further understand the comet's behaviour as it moves away from the Sun. Ongoing monitoring efforts will focus on its evolving structure and composition.</p>
