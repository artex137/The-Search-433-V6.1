      <h2>Recent image confirms continued activity in interstellar comet heading towards Jupiter</h2>

<p>An image taken on February 18, 2026, has confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I ATLAS continues to exhibit activity as it approaches Jupiter. The image, captured by astronomers at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, shows a distinct tail indicating the comet's ongoing outgassing.</p>

<p>This development is significant for astronomers studying the dynamics of interstellar objects and their impact on the solar system. The discovery has prompted researchers to increase monitoring efforts as 3I ATLAS travels through the inner solar system, potentially providing insights into the composition of such comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: February 18, 2026</li>
    <li>Location of observation: European Southern Observatory, Chile</li>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I ATLAS</li>
    <li>Current trajectory: Approaching Jupiter</li>
    <li>Sign of activity: Distinct tail observed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS was first detected in 2023 and has since been under observation by various astronomical agencies. The comet's trajectory has been tracked as it moves towards Jupiter, with increased interest following recent images confirming its activity.</p>

<p>On February 18, 2026, astronomers at the European Southern Observatory captured a new image of 3I ATLAS, which displayed a noticeable tail, indicating that it is actively outgassing as it approaches the gas giant.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observation of a tail on 3I ATLAS suggests that it is releasing gas and dust, which is typical behavior for comets,” said Dr. Maria Lopez, an astronomer at the European Southern Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar comets, having entered the solar system in 2023. Its activity provides valuable data on the properties of such objects and their interactions with solar radiation.</p>

<p>Previous studies of interstellar comets have revealed insights into their composition and origins, which can help scientists understand more about the formation of our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, with plans for further imaging and analysis to study its composition and behavior. The next significant observation window is expected in March 2026.</p>
