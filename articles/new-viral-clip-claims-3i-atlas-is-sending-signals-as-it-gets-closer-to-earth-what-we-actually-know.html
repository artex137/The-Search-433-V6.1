      <h2>New viral clip claims 3I/Atlas is sending signals as it gets closer to Earth: What we actually know</h2>

<p>3I/Atlas has gained attention after a viral video claims it is “sending signals” as it approaches Earth. The video combines telescope footage with audio beeps, suggesting real-time transmissions, but no observatory or radio facility has verified these claims. Instead, scientists have detected routine comet physics that can be measured at radio wavelengths, according to NASA and other observatories.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises public interest and concern regarding the nature of 3I/Atlas. NASA has reiterated that 3I/Atlas poses no threat to Earth and behaves like a natural comet. The agency emphasizes that the “signals” detected are indicative of the comet's chemistry rather than any form of communication.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas is expected to be closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles (1.8 AU).</li>
    <li>The viral video claims to show signals from 3I/Atlas, but no observatory has verified this.</li>
    <li>Nobody has detected technosignatures or evidence of artificial activity from 3I/Atlas.</li>
    <li>NASA’s latest updates confirm 3I/Atlas behaves like a typical comet, with significant water outgassing.</li>
    <li>Hydroxyl signatures detected by telescopes are a result of water vapor, not communication.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas follows a hyperbolic path through the solar system, with its closest approach to the Sun occurring around October 30, 2025. Observations indicated the comet was approximately 1.4 AU from the Sun at that time. As it continues on its trajectory, it will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at about 1.8 AU.</p>

<p>During late October 2025, ground telescopes briefly lost sight of 3I/Atlas as it passed behind the Sun from Earth's perspective. However, spacecraft continued to track its movements. As the viewing conditions improve, various agencies are compiling images and spectra to better understand the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We certainly haven’t seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” said NASA’s Nicola Fox.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet. And all evidence points to it being a comet,” added NASA’s Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous observations of other interstellar objects, such as ʻOumuamua and Borisov, have raised questions about their compositions and behaviors. 3I/Atlas is notable for its active water outgassing, which is being studied to understand better the formation of comets and planets around stars.</p>

<p>Despite some speculative views suggesting that its trajectory may indicate technological origins, the consensus among scientists is that 3I/Atlas exhibits natural comet behavior, with no evidence supporting the idea of artificial signals.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the approach of 3I/Atlas continues, agencies will release more images and data from ongoing observations. NASA has emphasized that there is zero impact risk from the comet, and further updates will clarify its behavior as it nears its closest approach.</p>
