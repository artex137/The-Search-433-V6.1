      <h2>Fact Check: Video Clip Does NOT Show Timelapse Of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A video clip circulating on social media does not show a timelapse of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, according to a fact check by Lead Stories. The clip was posted on Instagram by @allbrightbretthunter on October 26, 2025, and misidentifies the image as being from the comet, which was captured by the Gemini North telescope on July 15, 2025.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as misinformation about astronomical phenomena can mislead the public and hinder scientific understanding. The National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab) released the authentic image of 3I/ATLAS to aid scientific inquiry into the characteristics of this rare comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The mislabeled video was posted on Instagram on October 26, 2025.</li>
    <li>The authentic image of comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on July 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>NOIRLab released the actual image of the comet.</li>
    <li>Reverse image searches for the clip did not yield exact matches.</li>
    <li>Google's AI misidentified the image as 3I/ATLAS in social media posts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 15, 2025, astronomers using the Gemini North telescope captured an image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. This discovery marked the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</p>
<p>On October 26, 2025, a mislabeled video clip surfaced on Instagram, claiming to show a timelapse of 3I/ATLAS. Lead Stories initiated a fact check to clarify the misinformation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Interstellar objects are visitors from solar systems beyond our own, and the third ever such object, known as 3I/ATLAS, has just been discovered,” said NOIRLab in their official release.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Misinformation regarding astronomical events is not uncommon, with social media often amplifying incorrect claims. The accurate portrayal of such phenomena is crucial for public understanding and scientific discourse.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lead Stories plans to update their fact check with analyses from microbiology experts regarding the origins of the mislabeled video clip.</p>
