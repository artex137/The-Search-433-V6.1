      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas detected by Atlas in Chile brings clues about the formation of stellar systems</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, identified by the Atlas system in Chile on July 1, 2025, is currently advancing through the Solar System at a speed exceeding 30 km/s. This interstellar object, the third confirmed of its kind, follows a hyperbolic trajectory and poses no risk to Earth, with a minimum approach distance of 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas provides valuable insights into materials formed in distant environments. Astronomers are utilizing telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, to analyze its composition and monitor its trajectory as it approaches perihelion, expected in the next few weeks at a distance of 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object travels at over 30 km/s.</li>
    <li>It will reach perihelion at 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The minimum approach distance to Earth is 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The core of the comet is estimated to be about 1 kilometer in diameter.</li>
    <li>More than 50 institutions across 20 countries are collaborating on the observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the Atlas system in the Atacama Desert detected comet 3I/Atlas during routine observations. Initial data indicated that the comet's orbit is not gravitationally bound to the Sun, confirming its classification as an interstellar object within a few days.</p>

<p>As observations continued, spectroscopic analyses revealed a predominance of frozen carbon dioxide (CO₂) on the surface, indicating formation at temperatures below -100°C in regions of another star system. The comet is expected to pass through Mars' orbit in December 2025, and optical observations will conclude in mid-2026 as it moves further away.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of water vapor and carbon monoxide differentiates 3I/Atlas from local comets,” said an astronomer involved in the study. “Each interstellar object provides unique data about the conditions in distant systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is notable for its cometary activity, which contrasts with 1I/Oumuamua, an earlier interstellar object that did not show such activity. Unlike 2I/Borisov, which had a lower CO₂ content, 3I/Atlas displays a higher relative concentration, highlighting the diversity in interstellar formation processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following perihelion, 3I/Atlas will accelerate out of the Solar System, with a final speed projected to exceed 40 km/s. Researchers will continue to analyze data collected from various telescopes to enhance understanding of chemical evolution in protoplanetary disks.</p>
