      <h2>Changes in 3I/ATLAS’ Coma Offer Insights into Cometary Formation Theories</h2>

<p>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS has undergone significant changes as it travels through our solar system, largely due to its proximity to solar energy for the first time in potentially billions of years. Scientists have monitored these transformations to ensure they align with scientific understanding and aid comparisons between 3I/ATLAS and previously observed interstellar visitors.</p>

<p>A new study by European researchers, published on the arXiv preprint server, details how variations in the nickel to iron (Ni/Fe) abundance ratio within 3I/ATLAS’ coma relate to cometary geology. The findings may clarify the presence of nickel and iron in the comet's coma, raising questions about their origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was observed from August to September 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet approached from 3.14 astronomical units (AU) to 2.14 AU from the sun.</li>
    <li>The European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile was used for observations.</li>
    <li>Nickel was consistently detectable, while iron absorption lines appeared as the comet neared 2.64 AU from the sun.</li>
    <li>The Ni/Fe ratio observed in 2I/Borisov was approximately ten times higher than that of the sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has been classified as a "C2-depleted" comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2023, researchers began observing 3I/ATLAS as it approached the sun. Over the following weeks, the comet transitioned from 3.14 AU to 2.14 AU. During this time, nickel was consistently detected, while iron absorption lines were only visible as the comet neared within 2.64 AU of the sun.</p>
<p>This sequence led to the observation of an anomalously high Ni/Fe ratio, revealing a dramatic evolution in measurements not previously documented.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The uniformity of the high Ni/Fe ratio among interstellar visitors and solar system comets suggests a shared formation process, independent of the materials available in their respective stellar systems,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of nickel and iron in the coma of 3I/ATLAS raises questions, as previous theories suggested these metals might originate from organometallic compounds related to carbonyl groups. Nickel tetracarbonyl and iron pentacarbonyl have sufficiently low sublimation points to transition to gas even at greater distances from the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations and data collection are expected to expand insights into 3I/ATLAS, particularly regarding its complex Ni/Fe ratio as it moves closer to the sun. The comet will soon become less visible for several months, but it continues to attract attention from researchers eager to deepen their understanding of this rare cosmic visitor.</p>
