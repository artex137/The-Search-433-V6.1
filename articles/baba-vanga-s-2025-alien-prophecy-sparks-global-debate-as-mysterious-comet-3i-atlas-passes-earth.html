      <h2>Baba Vanga's 2025 alien prophecy sparks global debate as mysterious comet 3I/ATLAS passes Earth</h2>

<p>Baba Vanga's long-standing prophecy regarding alien contact has resurfaced as Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, reaching its closest point on October 29-30, 2025. The comet travels at a speed of 1.3 million mph, but authorities report that it poses no threat to the planet.</p>

<p>This event has drawn attention from both believers and skeptics. NASA has confirmed that Comet 3I/ATLAS is a natural interstellar comet, not an alien spacecraft. The comet has captured the public's imagination, particularly among those who attribute its arrival to Vanga's predictions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will be closest to Earth on October 29-30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of 1.3 million mph.</li>
    <li>It was discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>Nasa confirms it is a natural interstellar comet, posing no danger to Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet will reappear after mid-November 2025 from the far side of the sun.</li>
    <li>Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian mystic, died in 1996.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Baba Vanga's predictions have long fascinated the public, particularly her claim that aliens would contact humanity in 2025. On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in Chile, prompting widespread media coverage and public interest.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches Earth, conspiracy theories have gained traction, linking its arrival to Vanga's prophecies. Despite the hype, NASA maintains that the comet is a natural phenomenon, exhibiting typical behavior as it nears the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The overwhelming scientific consensus supports 3I/ATLAS as a natural interstellar comet rather than alien technology.” – NASA</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time celestial events have been tied to mysticism. Baba Vanga is credited with numerous predictions, including significant historical events. Her followers often interpret her vague statements to fit current events, a practice known as “retrofitting.”</p>

<p>The rarity of interstellar comets adds to the intrigue. Finding such a comet is uncommon, and while it originates outside the solar system, scientists confirm it is not alien in nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will temporarily disappear from view due to the sun's glare starting in late October. It is expected to reappear in mid-November 2025, at which point scientists will provide detailed observational data, further clarifying its characteristics and trajectory.</p>
