      <h2>Congress Shown Explosive Military Video of Missile Bouncing Off UFO in Middle East Airspace</h2>

<p>During a recent U.S. House Oversight hearing, lawmakers were presented with a video that appears to show a Hellfire missile fired from a Reaper drone striking an unidentified object and bouncing off. The footage, recorded near the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024, has raised significant questions about national security and the nature of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>This incident has sparked debate over hidden military programs and the effectiveness of modern weaponry. The 45-second video, shared by Rep. Eric Burlison, depicts a glowing spherical object in midair, which the missile fails to destroy, suggesting advanced defensive capabilities or unique physical properties of the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video recorded on October 30, 2024, by an MQ-9 Reaper drone off the Yemeni coast.</li>
    <li>Footage shows a Hellfire missile striking a glowing spherical object and bouncing off.</li>
    <li>Over 750 new UAP sightings reported between May 2023 and June 2024.</li>
    <li>Testimony from whistleblowers indicates the government has unreleased footage on UAPs.</li>
    <li>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna co-leads a bipartisan investigation into UAPs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone recorded a video off the coast of Yemen, capturing a missile strike on an unidentified object. The footage was later shown during a Congressional session, prompting discussions about the implications for national security. In the same hearing, Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins provided an account of a 2023 sighting involving a "Tic Tac–shaped" object, which further fueled the debate on UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’ve never seen a Hellfire hit and bounce—it’s built to obliterate,” said Lue Elizondo, former Pentagon UAP program lead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This incident is a surreal failure of modern weaponry,” commented George Knapp, a veteran investigative journalist on UAPs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna criticized the long-standing culture of secrecy surrounding UAP incidents.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous high-profile UAP sightings have led to varying explanations, with some incidents later identified as optical illusions or balloon reflections. The recent footage, however, appears to defy conventional analysis, raising calls for greater transparency and public access to UAP data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers are expected to continue investigations into UAP incidents and seek increased transparency from government agencies regarding past and current sightings.</p>
