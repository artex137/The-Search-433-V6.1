      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS emits first radio signal during solar system passage</h2>

<p>Astronomers have recorded the first radio signal from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes the halfway point of its journey through the solar system. The signal was detected while the comet traveled at speeds exceeding 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h). No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first time a radio signal has been detected from an interstellar comet. Authorities in the scientific community are examining the implications of this finding, confirming that the signal is natural and not of alien origin, as some might speculate.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>It was first observed in early July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at speeds of over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Earlier observations of the comet trace back to May 2025.</li>
    <li>The detection of the radio signal occurred during its solar system passage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July 2025, astronomers first observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet was noted for its high velocity, traveling at over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h). Following earlier observations traced to May, the comet's passage through the solar system continued, culminating in the detection of its first radio signal.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The signal is entirely natural," scientists have confirmed, addressing speculations regarding its origins.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, interstellar comets have been of significant interest to astronomers. 3I/ATLAS joins the ranks of other known interstellar objects, contributing to our understanding of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the signal and the behavior of comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves further through the solar system. Further studies are expected to deepen understanding of interstellar comets and their characteristics.</p>
