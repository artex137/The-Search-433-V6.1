      <h2>From ‘Bugonia’ to ‘Pluribus’: Why today’s aliens aren’t like they used to be</h2>

<p>Two recent fictional narratives have highlighted a shift in the portrayal of aliens in popular culture. In the films “Bugonia” and “Pluribus,” aliens are depicted not as extraterrestrial beings, but as reflections of human fears and social issues. These stories emerged in 2025, coinciding with the detection of an interstellar object by Chile’s ATLAS observatory, which had sparked public speculation about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This shift in narrative matters as it reflects changing societal concerns, particularly regarding technology and social alienation. Authorities and cultural commentators are examining how these new portrayals of aliens serve as metaphors for contemporary anxieties, including distrust in institutions and the impact of conspiracy theories.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Two fictional works, "Bugonia" and "Pluribus," have been released in 2025.</li>
    <li>Chile’s ATLAS observatory detected the third interstellar object in history.</li>
    <li>The object was mistakenly believed to be an alien spacecraft by internet users for several months.</li>
    <li>“Bugonia” is directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, while “Pluribus” is created by Vince Gilligan.</li>
    <li>Both stories explore themes of political alienation and social anxiety.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2025, the ATLAS observatory in Chile detected an interstellar object, leading to widespread speculation about extraterrestrial life. Concurrently, the film “Bugonia” was released, portraying a conspiracy theory involving aliens that satirizes modern distrust of institutions. “Pluribus,” another narrative, was also released, focusing on a character immune to a global happiness virus. Both works have sparked discussions on the symbolic nature of alien encounters in contemporary society.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Today’s new fables about extraterrestrial life are no longer like the ones that mesmerized the last century,” said philosopher Pepe Tesoro, highlighting the evolution of alien narratives in response to modern fears.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, portrayals of aliens have reflected societal anxieties. During the Franco dictatorship in Spain, UFO sightings were used as propaganda tools, serving to distract the public from political repression. Similarly, in Italy during the late 1970s, a surge in UFO sightings coincided with significant social unrest. These past instances illustrate how alien myths often mirror collective fears and desires, adapting to the political and social context of their time.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations into the cultural implications of these narratives continue, experts anticipate further analysis of how contemporary alien fables will evolve in response to ongoing political and technological changes. Future discussions may focus on the connection between societal anxieties and the resurgence of interest in extraterrestrial life.</p>
