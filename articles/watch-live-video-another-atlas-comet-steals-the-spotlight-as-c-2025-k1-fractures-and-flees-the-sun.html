      <h2>Comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS Fractures After Close Encounter with the Sun</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has fractured into multiple large pieces following a close approach to the sun on October 8, 2025. The comet is currently drawing global attention as skywatchers prepare to observe it in a livestream event scheduled for November 24 at 10 p.m. EST (0300 GMT on November 25).</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a unique opportunity for astronomers and the public to witness the breakup of the comet, which is believed to have occurred due to intense solar heating. The Virtual Telescope Project will stream live views of the comet from Manciano, Italy, weather permitting.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was first detected on May 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion, its closest approach to the sun, on October 8, coming within 31 million miles (50 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>The comet fractured into at least three large pieces on November 11, 2025.</li>
    <li>The livestream of the comet is set for November 24 at 10 p.m. EST (0300 GMT on November 25).</li>
    <li>The comet can be viewed with a small telescope, near the Big Dipper in the constellation Ursa Major.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 24, 2025, astronomers first detected Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) as it approached the inner solar system. The comet reached perihelion on October 8, coming close to the sun. On November 11, observers noted a dramatic breakup of the comet, which resulted in at least three large pieces.</p>

<p>The livestream event for the comet is planned for November 24, allowing viewers to see the fragments as they drift apart.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The breakup of Comet C/2025 K1 is likely due to intense solar heating that weakened its nucleus during the close encounter,” said astronomers involved in the monitoring of the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is not related to the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has been confirmed as the third known object from beyond our solar system. Both share the ATLAS designation because they were discovered by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers can anticipate the livestream event on November 24, which will provide real-time footage of the comet as it continues its journey away from the sun.</p>
