      <h2>James Webb telescope reveals comet 3I/ATLAS for the first time</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed the comet 3I/ATLAS for the first time on August 6, 2023. The comet briefly flew into the solar system and was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) telescope. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks only the third interstellar object detected in the solar system, following the asteroid 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and the comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Researchers aim to understand the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its size, physical properties, and chemical composition, to gain insight into the conditions that existed in its system during formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of observation:</strong> August 6, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Previous observations:</strong> Habble and SPHEREx</li>
    <li><strong>Comet's age:</strong> Approximately 7 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Carbon dioxide to water ratio:</strong> Highest ever observed in a comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Subsequent observations were conducted by the Habble and SPHEREx telescopes. The James Webb Space Telescope observed the comet on August 6, 2023, using infrared cameras and a near-infrared spectrograph. These studies have provided new insights into the comet's chemical composition and its origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The study of similar comets from other star systems helps to understand the conditions that existed in these systems during their formation,” said one of the astronomers involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its potential age and origin. Research indicates that it may be about 3 billion years older than the solar system, suggesting it comes from the "thick disk" of the Milky Way, a region much older than the Sun's location in the "thin disk." This context provides valuable information about the early stages of our galaxy's development.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from the JWST and other telescopes to further investigate the characteristics and origins of comet 3I/ATLAS, contributing to our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
