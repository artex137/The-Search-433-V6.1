      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Debate Among Scientists</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been racing through our solar system at unprecedented speeds since its discovery on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey. Observations from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope on 21 July 2025 have revealed its teardrop shape and a solid icy nucleus, measuring between 320 metres and 5.6 kilometres in diameter. As of now, there have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this celestial event.</p>

<p>The comet's unusual size, shape, and trajectory have ignited discussions among scientists, researchers, and space enthusiasts regarding its true nature. Some experts speculate that 3I/ATLAS could be an artificial object rather than a natural comet. The ongoing analysis of its physical properties, including its record speed of 137,000 miles per hour (61 kilometres per second), has intensified interest in this cosmic visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July 2025 by ATLAS survey</li>
    <li>Observation date: 21 July 2025</li>
    <li>Maximum speed: 137,000 miles per hour (61 kilometres per second)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: 29 million kilometres on 3 October 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: 30 October 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun</li>
    <li>Approaching Jupiter: 16 March 2026</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: Over 33 billion tonnes (speculative)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey. Following this, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured observations of the comet on 21 July 2025, revealing its teardrop shape and icy nucleus. On 3 October 2025, the comet passed within 29 million kilometres of Mars. It is expected to reach perihelion on 30 October 2025, before approaching Jupiter on 16 March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We have found that none of the stars in the solar neighbourhood can explain the trajectory and high velocity of 3I/ATLAS,” said Xabier Pérez-Couto, lead author of a 2025 study tracing its origins.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS was designed by extraterrestrial intelligence, why is it inclined by about 5 degrees relative to the ecliptic plane?” questioned Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS is not new. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have also prompted discussions regarding their origins and nature. While most scientists support a natural explanation for such celestial bodies, anomalies like those observed in 3I/ATLAS continue to fuel theories about potential extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, it remains a prime target for future studies by Mars and Jupiter space probes. Scientists will closely monitor its trajectory and physical properties as new data becomes available.</p>
