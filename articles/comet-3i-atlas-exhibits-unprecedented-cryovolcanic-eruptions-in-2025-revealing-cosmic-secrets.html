      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits unprecedented cryovolcanic eruptions in 2025 revealing cosmic secrets</h2>

<p>Spanish scientists from the Observatório Montsec have recorded evidence of cryovolcanic eruptions on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in October 2025. The comet, which is the third of its kind detected in our solar system, has exhibited this phenomenon during its close approach to the Sun, approximately 378 million kilometers away. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests a composition rich in ice and primitive materials, similar to objects found beyond Neptune's orbit. The findings, driven by the ATLAS system in Chile, highlight the importance of cosmic visitors in understanding the formation of distant star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 221,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun at eruptions:</strong> 378 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Diameter:</strong> 440 meters to 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Mass:</strong> Over 600 million metric tons</li>
    <li><strong>Possible Age:</strong> 7 to 14 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers began monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS following its detection by the ATLAS system. The activity of the comet increased dramatically in October 2025, leading to the observation of cryovolcanic eruptions. The perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun. High-resolution images were captured by the Telescópio Joan Oró and regional observatories in Spain.</p>

<p>The eruptions have been attributed to internal chemical reactions driven by solar heating, which released gases such as carbon monoxide and cyanide. The presence of atomic nickel vapor supports the hypothesis of a complex metallic nucleus within the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This phenomenon offers a rare opportunity to observe the dynamics of an interstellar body in real time, providing crucial data for astrophysics and comparative planetary geology,” said a spokesperson from Observatório Montsec.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects that provide insight into the chemical conditions of distant star systems. Previous studies have indicated that these objects act as time capsules, preserving the chemistry and formation processes of their native systems. The comet's unique characteristics have drawn comparisons to carbonaceous chondrites found in Antarctica, suggesting a shared origin in stellar nebulae.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue until its departure from the solar system in 2026. The closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, will allow for further study, including the potential for future interceptor missions to gather more data on its composition and implications for planetary formation.</p>
