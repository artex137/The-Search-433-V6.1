      <h2>Brian Cox shares thoughts on Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS: 'It's on a journey across Milky Way galaxy'</h2>

<p>On July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) detected 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object moving through the Solar System. This comet, one of only three interstellar objects ever discovered, has drawn significant attention from the scientific community and the public.</p>

<p>Authorities, including NASA and SETI, are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it travels through space. According to Professor Brian Cox from the University of Manchester, the comet provides a unique opportunity to study material that predates the formation of the Earth and the Sun. The comet's trajectory and the potential for capturing images of it have sparked excitement among astronomers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>It is one of only three known interstellar objects.</li>
    <li>The comet has been traveling through interstellar space for approximately 10 billion years.</li>
    <li>NASA is attempting to capture images of 3I/ATLAS using the Perseverance rover on Mars.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency (ESA) used the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter to capture images of the comet.</li>
    <li>Scientists are utilizing telescopes, including the James Webb and Hubble, to observe the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS. Since its discovery, astronomers have tracked its trajectory and confirmed it to be a comet due to observed outgassing. As the comet approached the Sun, it passed behind it, making it difficult to observe. However, scientists from ESA managed to capture images before it entered this blind spot.</p>

<p>Plans are underway to capture further images of the comet as it moves toward Jupiter, utilizing the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There’s an estimate from a couple of days ago that it might have formed seven and a half billion years ago,” said Brian Cox. “It’s been on its journey across the Milky Way galaxy." </blockquote>

<blockquote>“So that, to me, is a remarkable story,” Cox added, highlighting the significance of capturing interstellar comets from the surface of other planets.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it represents a time capsule from an earlier age of the universe. The scientific community is particularly interested in studying such objects, as they can provide insights into the formation of celestial bodies. This event comes at a time when technology has advanced to the point where capturing images of interstellar objects is becoming increasingly feasible.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue their efforts to capture images of 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the Solar System. Observations will be conducted using various spacecraft and telescopes to gather data on this remarkable interstellar visitor.</p>
