      <h2>Pre-perihelion Development of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Researchers have conducted pre-perihelion optical observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS between July and September 2025 using the Nordic Optical Telescope. The study reveals significant details regarding the comet's dust production and morphology, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This research is crucial as it enhances the understanding of cometary behavior and characteristics, particularly in relation to interstellar objects. The findings indicate that the dust production rates are influenced by the comet's distance from the Sun, which could have implications for future observations and studies of similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed between July and September 2025.</li>
    <li>Measurements taken using the Nordic Optical Telescope.</li>
    <li>Dust production rates at 2 au are 180 kg/s.</li>
    <li>Effective radius of optically dominant dust particles is 0.1 mm.</li>
    <li>Slow ejection speed of dust particles is 5 m/s.</li>
    <li>Heliocentric distance range during observations was 4.6 au to 1.8 au.</li>
    <li>Primary driver of activity identified as carbon dioxide.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the observations of comet 3I/ATLAS began, revealing a Sun-facing dust fan. As the months progressed, the morphology shifted to a tail dominated by dust particles ejecting in an antisolar direction. The delayed emergence of this tail is attributed to the large size and slow ejection of the dust particles.</p>

<p>By September 2025, researchers had completed their analysis, noting that dust production rates varied significantly with the comet's heliocentric distance. The study confirms that the observed characteristics of 3I/ATLAS are consistent with those of other comets, yet they highlight the unique aspects of this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The measured heliocentric index is unremarkable in the context of solar system comets, and provides no basis on which to describe 3I as either dynamically old or new,” said David Jewitt, one of the researchers involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies of interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, have provided a comparative framework for understanding 3I/ATLAS. While 2I exhibited a smaller heliocentric index, the dust production rates were significantly lower at the same distance. This indicates a diverse range of behaviors among interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. Future observations may provide additional insights into the comet's behavior and composition, contributing to the broader understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
