      <h2>Harvard Scientist Claims Iron Levels Hint at Artificial Interstellar Origin of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has suggested that unusual iron levels in comet 3I/ATLAS may indicate an artificial interstellar origin, as the object made its closest approach to Earth on 19 December at approximately 6:00 UK time. The comet passed at a distance of about 270 million kilometres (168 million miles), moving at an estimated speed of 153,000 mph.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked a debate between Loeb and NASA, which asserts that there is "overwhelming evidence" that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet. The discussion highlights ongoing tensions between mainstream astronomy and those investigating signs of intelligent life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: 19 December</li>
    <li>Time of closest approach: 6:00 UK time</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 270 million km (168 million miles)</li>
    <li>Speed: 153,000 mph</li>
    <li>Next significant milestone: Passing Jupiter in early 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 19 December, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, skimming past at a safe distance while travelling at high speed. The object has continued on its trajectory towards the outer solar system following this encounter.</p>
<p>In October, Avi Loeb published a blog post raising questions about the chemical composition of the comet, specifically regarding the presence of nickel and iron in its coma. This prompted discussions about the potential origins of the comet.</p>
<p>NASA has consistently maintained that the object's characteristics align with those of known comets, countering Loeb's claims.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "At the distances at which comets are observed, the temperature is far too low to vaporise silicate, sulphide, and metallic grains that contain nickel and iron atoms."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tom Statler, a lead scientist at NASA, said, "It looks like a comet. It does commit things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This debate is part of a broader discussion about the search for extraterrestrial life and the interpretation of unusual celestial phenomena. Previous incidents involving similar claims have often led to contention between scientific communities and those advocating for the exploration of non-traditional hypotheses.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is set to continue its journey through the solar system, with trajectory models indicating it will pass Jupiter in early 2026 and clear the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune by 2028. Observations of the object will likely continue until it becomes too distant for current instruments to detect.</p>
