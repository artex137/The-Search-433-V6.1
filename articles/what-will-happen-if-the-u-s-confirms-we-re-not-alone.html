      <h2>What will happen if the U.S. confirms we’re not alone?</h2>

<p>During a Congressional hearing on UFOs in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, credible witnesses have testified that they have observed aircraft that may be of extraterrestrial origin. This marks the third round of hearings in three years focused on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). U.S. Representative Eric Burlison presented a video showing a U.S. hellfire missile striking a UFO off the coast of Yemen, which reportedly remained undamaged and continued on its path.</p>

<p>The hearings have attracted bipartisan support, with lawmakers emphasizing the importance of transparency regarding UFOs. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), chair of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, stated that the issue has been shrouded in secrecy and deserves serious attention. Additionally, recent reports of potential signs of life on Mars and a distant planet have heightened interest in the subject.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For too long, the issue of unidentified anomalous phenomena – commonly known as UAPs – has been shrouded in secrecy, stigma, and in some cases outright dismissal. This is about national security, government accountability, and the American people’s right to the truth.” – Anna Paulina Luna, chair of the hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence, and unexplainable phenomena.” – Senator Chuck Schumer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Our goal is to assure credibility with regard to any investigation or record keeping of materials associated with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena.” – Senator John Rounds.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent hearings are part of a growing movement among lawmakers to push for transparency about UFOs. Previous incidents, such as the 1960 Brookings Institute report, have raised questions about how humanity might react to the confirmation of extraterrestrial life. The Sol Foundation has called for the passage of the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act, emphasizing the need for proper oversight of the issue.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAPs are expected to continue as Congress prepares to reintroduce the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act in 2025. Lawmakers have expressed a commitment to declassifying information regarding UFOs and ensuring that the public is informed about related findings.</p>
