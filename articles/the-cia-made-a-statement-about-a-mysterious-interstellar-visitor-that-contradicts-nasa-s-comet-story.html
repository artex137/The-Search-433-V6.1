      <h2>The CIA made a statement about a mysterious interstellar visitor that contradicts NASA's comet story</h2>

<p>The CIA has issued a statement regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, contradicting NASA's classification of it as a comet. The object, identified by astronomers from Spain's University of A Coruña, has sparked debate between the two agencies since its discovery in October 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this celestial body.</p>

<p>This matter raises questions about transparency in government agencies concerning extraterrestrial activity. The CIA's refusal to disclose information has led to speculation and concern among researchers and the public. As NASA continues to maintain that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, the difference in perspectives between the two agencies has fueled conspiracy theories.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object identified as 3I/ATLAS, approximately 5 km wide.</li>
    <li>Discovered by astronomers from Spain's University of A Coruña in October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA classified the object as a comet following studies using the Hubble Telescope.</li>
    <li>CIA responded to a Freedom of Information Act request by stating it could not confirm or deny the existence of relevant records.</li>
    <li>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has raised concerns over the CIA's classification of information related to 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, astronomers from the University of A Coruña discovered the interstellar object now known as 3I/ATLAS. The object was initially viewed as a significant find, being described as a 'window into the Universe’s past' due to its estimated age of 10 billion years.</p>

<p>In November 2025, NASA released its findings, using the Hubble Telescope to clarify the object's nature, declaring it a comet. Shortly after, a Freedom of Information Act request was filed with the CIA seeking information about 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>On January 12, 2026, the CIA responded to the FOIA request, stating that it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of related records, citing the National Security Act as the reason for withholding information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The CIA can neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records responsive to the request,”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That fact this information is treated as sensitive enough to be classified by the CIA is surprising, given that NASA officials stated decisively at a press conference that 3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin.” – Avi Loeb, Harvard professor</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has renewed discussions about transparency in governmental organizations, especially when it comes to space-related phenomena. The differing perspectives of NASA and the CIA highlight the ongoing debate about what information is made available to the public concerning extraterrestrial objects.</p>

<p>Previous incidents involving government secrecy about unidentified aerial phenomena have also contributed to public skepticism regarding official statements about space and potential extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the situation develops, researchers and the public await further clarification from both NASA and the CIA regarding 3I/ATLAS. Investigations into the nature of the object may continue, along with ongoing discussions about the implications of the agencies' differing accounts.</p>
