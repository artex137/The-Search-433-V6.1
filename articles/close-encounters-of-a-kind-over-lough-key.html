      <h2>Close encounters of a kind over Lough Key</h2>

<p>A UFO skywatch event in Boyle, Ireland, on Saturday evening has drawn attention after attendees reported witnessing a peculiar aerial phenomenon over Lough Key. Over 50 people participated in the gathering, organized by local UFO expert Dr. Eamon Ansboro, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The event is significant as it continues Dr. Ansboro's ongoing research into extra-terrestrial life forms and aims to provide evidence for unusual aerial phenomena. Dr. Ansboro has spent three decades collecting data on unidentified aerial phenomena, also known as UAPs, and is preparing to present his findings to the International Astronomical Union in Paris early next year.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event took place on Saturday evening, October 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>Location: Lough Key, Boyle, Ireland.</li>
    <li>Over 50 participants attended the skywatch event.</li>
    <li>Dr. Eamon Ansboro has tracked 40 unusual aerial sightings in the last 20 years.</li>
    <li>Unusual activity was predicted between 5 and 7 p.m. on the day of the event.</li>
    <li>The sighting occurred around 8 p.m. after many participants had left.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Saturday, October 21, 2023, Dr. Eamon Ansboro organized a UFO skywatch event at Lough Key, inviting members of the public to participate. Anticipation built as participants gathered, but inclement weather led to many leaving before any sightings occurred. Around 8 p.m., a small group of remaining skywatchers, including Richard Canny, reported seeing a bright white light moving erratically in the sky.</p>

<p>The light was observed for approximately ten minutes, during which it exhibited unusual movements, prompting excitement among the witnesses. The event concluded with the participants intrigued by the sighting, despite the challenges posed by the weather and visibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I did see a peculiar aerial phenomenon hovering high over the Lough Key waters,” said Richard Canny, a participant in the event.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Eamon Ansboro commented on the significance of the sightings, stating, “We have shown that there is a DNA connection here - it's a living sort of system in itself. It's intelligent. That's all we know.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Dr. Eamon Ansboro has dedicated over 30 years to researching UAPs, with his work appearing in various scientific journals. His recent findings, including a paper that received 150,000 reads by scientists, have drawn interest to the phenomenon of plasma orbs, which he believes may indicate intelligent life forms. Lough Key has become a focal point for these investigations, with numerous sightings reported in the area.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Dr. Ansboro will continue his research into UAPs and plans to present his findings at the International Astronomical Union in Paris in early 2024. Further investigations into the recent sightings at Lough Key may also be conducted as interest in the phenomenon grows.</p>
