      <h2>Harvard scientist issues alien statement as 'not natural' space object approaches Mars</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the nature of the comet 3I/ATLAS, which passed Mars from October 1 to October 7, 2023. The comet, first spotted in July by a telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, is believed to be an interstellar object that has traveled from beyond the solar system.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it has prompted discussions about potential threats from space objects. The European Space Agency (ESA) has captured images of 3I/ATLAS, and scientists are currently analyzing the data to understand its composition. ESA's Juice spacecraft is scheduled to observe the comet again in November.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed Mars between October 1 and October 7, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was first detected in July 2023 from a telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>During its closest approach on October 3, the comet was approximately 30 million kilometers from Mars.</li>
    <li>The ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured footage of the comet.</li>
    <li>The next observation by ESA’s Juice spacecraft is scheduled for November 2023.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is projected to be 269 million kilometers on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023 by a telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. It passed Mars between October 1 and October 7, 2023, with its closest approach occurring on October 3 at a distance of 30 million kilometers. ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured images of the comet during this time.</p>

<p>Following the observations, scientists have begun analyzing the data to understand the comet's composition. ESA’s Juice spacecraft is set to conduct further observations in November 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "A visitor in our backyard requires immediate attention because it could enter through the front door and pose an imminent threat."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "We do not have a contingency plan on how to search and respond to such a threat."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. In 2005, Congress directed NASA to identify 90 percent of space rocks larger than 140 meters that could threaten Earth. However, Loeb emphasized that alien technology may be less predictable than space rocks.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb and two colleagues have submitted a white paper to the United Nations, proposing the establishment of a committee to address potential threats from interstellar objects. This committee would coordinate global responses, promote the sharing of data, and create guidelines for studying or communicating with unusual space objects.</p>
