      <h2>3I/ATLAS Exhibits New Anomalies</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, around October 29-30, allowing scientists to study its composition and behavior. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever discovered, following ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Authorities and scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, are investigating its anomalous properties, which may suggest it is an extraterrestrial probe or form of alien technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Perihelion of comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> October 29-30</li>
    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Third interstellar comet discovered</li>
    <li><strong>Key researcher:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li><strong>Notable observations:</strong> Non-gravitational acceleration, unusual blue color</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion around October 29-30, 2023. This close approach to the Sun provided an opportunity for scientists to observe the comet's behavior and composition.</p>
<p>In the days following perihelion, new observations revealed that 3I/ATLAS exhibited non-gravitational acceleration, moving in ways that gravity cannot fully explain. Additionally, its color was noted to be bluer than typical comets, which usually appear redder.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb reported that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has exhibited a number of anomalous properties that suggest it might be an extraterrestrial probe or form of alien technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb pondered: "Could this color come from ionized gases, or —more provocatively— from something artificial, like an engine or light source within?"</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins the ranks of ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov as one of the few interstellar comets discovered. Its unique characteristics have sparked discussions in the scientific community about the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>
<p>Prior to this, both ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov generated significant interest due to their unusual shapes and trajectories, leading to ongoing debates about their origins and implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to investigate the properties of 3I/ATLAS, focusing on its anomalous behavior and what it may reveal about the nature of interstellar objects. Further observations and analyses are expected in the coming weeks.</p>
