      <h2>Expert claims 3I/ATLAS is 'Alien' object as it has 'precisely-tuned trajectory' to Jupiter</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a professor at Harvard University, has claimed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may be an alien spacecraft due to its peculiar trajectory toward Jupiter. Loeb presented these findings in a recent blog post, highlighting the object's unusual characteristics and its approach to Jupiter's Hill radius, which is expected to occur on March 16, 2024.</p>

<p>This assertion has sparked renewed debate in the scientific community regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb's claims suggest that the object could be engineered to release devices near Jupiter, raising questions about its origins and intent. NASA officials have maintained that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, while Loeb argues that its anomalies warrant further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is projected to come closest to Jupiter on March 16, 2024.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb identifies 12 irregularities supporting his theory of the object as an alien spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Loeb suggests that the jets observed around 3I/ATLAS may be technological thrusters.</li>
    <li>The object was hidden behind the Sun during its perihelion, limiting observational data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object, raising interest among astronomers. In a previous blog post, Avi Loeb detailed his observations of the object, claiming it displayed signs of technological origin. As of now, 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory toward Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is apparent that 3I/ATLAS is an extremely rare and mysterious object, especially if it happens to be a natural comet as argued by NASA officials,” said Professor Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“A spectroscopic measurement of the speed and composition of the jets of 3I/ATLAS would reveal whether they stem from the sublimation of pockets of ice on the surface of a rock or from technological thrusters,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS is not new, as discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial life and technology have been ongoing within the scientific community. Previous claims regarding unidentified objects in space have often met with skepticism, particularly from established organizations like NASA.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of 3I/ATLAS is expected as it approaches Jupiter, with scientists planning to conduct spectroscopic measurements to determine its composition and behavior.</p>
