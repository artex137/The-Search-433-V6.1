      <h2>NASA Scientists Discover 3I/ATLAS is Larger Than Previously Estimated</h2>

<p>NASA scientists have realized that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is significantly larger than they initially estimated. The object, which is currently traversing our solar system, has a diameter exceeding 5 kilometers and weighs more than 33 billion tons. This revelation comes as astronomers continue to track its path, which will bring it close to Mars in the coming days.</p>

<p>This finding is crucial as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential origins. Researchers, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, are studying its unusual characteristics, including its high speed and unique orbit. The object has been observed emitting gases, leading to speculation about its composition and whether it poses any risk to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a diameter greater than 5 kilometers.</li>
    <li>It weighs more than 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to pass within 2.68 million kilometers of Mars.</li>
    <li>It has been detected traveling at high speeds.</li>
    <li>NASA’s HiRISE camera on the Mars orbiter will monitor 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected several months ago as it entered the solar system. Initial observations suggested it was a comet, but further analysis indicated it does not behave like one. Recent calculations have revealed its true size and mass, prompting increased interest from the scientific community.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb and his team have conducted an in-depth review of its trajectory and mass loss, leading to the conclusion that 3I/ATLAS could be much more massive than previously thought. This has sparked discussions about its origins and whether it could be a natural or artificial object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The nucleus is much bigger than initially calculated. 3I/ATLAS could be between one thousand and one hundred thousand times more massive than the two previous interstellar objects,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Both previous objects were significantly smaller, with ʻOumuamua measuring about 400 meters and Borisov less than one kilometer in diameter. The size and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS present new challenges for astronomers and researchers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars. Ongoing studies aim to understand its composition and potential origins, while researchers assess whether it could pose any risk to Earth in the future.</p>
