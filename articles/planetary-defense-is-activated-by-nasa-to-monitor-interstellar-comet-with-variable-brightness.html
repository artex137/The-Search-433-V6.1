      <h2>Planetary defense is activated by NASA to monitor interstellar comet with variable brightness</h2>

<p>The Administração Nacional of Aeronáutica and Espaço (NASA) has activated specific planetary defense protocols to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object currently crossing the Sistema Solar. The alert was issued through the Minor Planet Center in collaboration with the Rede Internacional of Alerta of Asteroides (IAWN) due to unexpected variations in the comet's luminosity and trajectory.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it highlights the need for enhanced monitoring techniques for interstellar objects. Although there is no immediate risk of impact with Terra, the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS necessitate preventive measures and technical training to ensure accurate tracking and data collection.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
  <li>It travels at a speed of over 210,000 km/h, confirming its interstellar origin.</li>
  <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to measure between 320 meters and 5.6 km in diameter.</li>
  <li>Initial reports indicate that visual distortion affects measurement accuracy by up to 20% for similar comets.</li>
  <li>The IAWN organized monitoring exercises between November 2025 and January 2026.</li>
  <li>The predicted trajectory indicates it will head towards Júpiter before leaving the solar system in 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile in July 2025. The initial alert regarding its variable brightness and trajectory was issued by NASA in collaboration with IAWN. Observations revealed an “antitail” phenomenon, complicating traditional orbital calculations. Between November 2025 and January 2026, IAWN conducted intensive monitoring exercises involving telescopes across various locations, including Havaí, Chile, and Europa.</p>

<p>As astronomers continued to study the comet, they confirmed its unique characteristics, such as a coma dominated by carbon dioxide. This led to increased efforts to refine astrometric methods for tracking interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This event presents a unique opportunity to study interstellar materials and strengthen international partnerships in astrometry,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object recorded in recent astronomical history, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its discovery and characteristics underscore the growing interest and need for international collaboration in planetary defense, particularly as more interstellar objects are detected.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Júpiter and eventually exits the solar system. Data collected will be analyzed to better understand the formation of distant systems beyond the Via Láctea.</p>
