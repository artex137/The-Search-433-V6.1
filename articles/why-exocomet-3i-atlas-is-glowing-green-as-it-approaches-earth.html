      <h2>Why exocomet 3I/ATLAS is glowing green as it approaches Earth</h2>

<p>The International Gemini Observatory has captured images of exocomet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with the closest approach scheduled for December 19. The comet, which is the third confirmed object ever observed traveling through our solar system, was photographed near the triple-star system Zaniah in the constellation Virgo.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides valuable data on the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Researchers utilized the Gemini Multi-object Spectrograph at Maunakea in Hawaii to capture the images, which show a faint greenish glow attributed to gases emitted from the comet's coma.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 1.79 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Location of observation:</strong> Maunakea, Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Observation details:</strong> Images captured using three filters: blue, green, and red</li>
    <li><strong>Background stars:</strong> Appear as streaks due to the comet's motion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers at the International Gemini Observatory have successfully captured images of exocomet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through our solar system. The comet resurfaced near Zaniah, a triple-star system in Virgo, and the images were taken using advanced spectrographic techniques.</p>
<p>The closest approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2023, at which point the comet will be 1.79 AU away from our planet. After this close encounter, 3I/ATLAS will continue on its trajectory, passing the orbit of Jupiter before exiting the solar system next year.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The faint greenish glow is caused by light emitted by specific gases, such as carbon, which are broken apart by solar radiation,” a spokesperson from the International Gemini Observatory said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Exocomet 3I/ATLAS is notable as the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system, following the discovery of 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov. Observations of such objects provide critical insights into the formation and evolution of other solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. Further observations are expected during its close pass, contributing to ongoing research into interstellar objects.</p>
