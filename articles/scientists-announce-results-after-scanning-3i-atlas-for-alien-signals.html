      <h2>Scientists Announce Results After Scanning 3I/ATLAS for Alien Signals</h2>

<p>In July, researchers using the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey telescope in Chile discovered a mysterious object, designated 3I/ATLAS, passing through the solar system at a speed too high to be influenced by the Sun's gravity. The object made its closest approach to Earth, coming within 267 million kilometres on December 19. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object identified in the solar system. While most scientists believe it to be a natural comet, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has suggested it could be an alien artifact. An international team from the Breakthrough Listen project has scanned the object for signs of extraterrestrial signals but reported no findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 2023</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance at Closest Approach: 267 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Telescope Used: Green Bank Telescope</li>
    <li>Research Team: Breakthrough Listen</li>
    <li>No signals detected from 3I/ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey telescope identified 3I/ATLAS. The object was noted for its speed, which suggests it is not bound by the Sun's gravity. On December 19, 2023, it made its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to this event, the Breakthrough Listen team aimed the Green Bank Telescope at 3I/ATLAS to search for potential signals. They reported that no artificial radio emissions were detected on the day before its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No artificial radio emission localized to 3I/ATLAS was detected,” the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) stated on its website.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In summary, 3I/ATLAS continues to behave as expected from natural astrophysical processes,” SETI added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There is currently no evidence to suggest that [interstellar objects] are anything other than natural astrophysical objects,” the Breakthrough Listen paper concluded.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/2017 U1 and 2I/Borisov. The rarity of such objects has led to heightened interest in their study. Avi Loeb has created a scale to assess the likelihood of interstellar objects being artificial, where 0 indicates a natural object and 10 indicates confirmed alien technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Breakthrough Listen team plans to continue observations of 3I/ATLAS, although further analysis may take months. Loeb has indicated he will not update his “Loeb scale” ranking of the object until new data is released and examined.</p>
