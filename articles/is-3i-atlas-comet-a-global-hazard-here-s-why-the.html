      <h2>Is 3I/Atlas Comet a Global Hazard? Here's Why the International Asteroid Warning Network Launched Campaign to Monitor Interstellar Body</h2>

<p>NASA's planetary defence group has initiated efforts to monitor the comet 3I/Atlas, which astronomers have observed emitting unusual signals. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has included this interstellar object, roughly the size of Manhattan, on its list of potential threats due to its suspected alien technology. The new monitoring campaign will begin on 27 November 2025 and conclude on 27 January 2026.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it aims to improve the accuracy of measurements for comets, which present unique challenges for predicting their trajectories. The IAWN, a coalition supported by NASA, focuses on identifying and assessing the potential impact of hazardous asteroids and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). The campaign's goals include enhancing the capabilities of the scientific community to gather precise astrometric data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas (C/2025 N1) is approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>The campaign will run from 27 November 2025 to 27 January 2026.</li>
    <li>IAWN aims to improve astrometric measurements of comets.</li>
    <li>The comet is predicted to pass closest to Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>The workshop for campaign participants requires registration by 7 November 2025.</li>
    <li>The ongoing US government shutdown has paused some NASA operations since 1 October 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The monitoring efforts for comet 3I/Atlas began after astronomers noted its peculiar emissions and behaviour. The IAWN announced its campaign on 21 October 2023, detailing plans for enhanced data collection methods. A workshop is scheduled to prepare participants for the campaign, with a registration deadline of 7 November 2025. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comets present unique challenges for accurate astrometric measurements and orbit predictions,” the IAWN stated in its bulletin. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Studying the object ahead of its approach is crucial in order to understand its nature and prepare for what its passage may reveal,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, founding director of Harvard University's Black Hole Initiative. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>IAWN has conducted similar exercises regularly since 2017, with this being the eighth such initiative. The agency has been planning a Fall 2025 comet campaign since 2024 to address the challenges posed by measuring comet positions, as they appear as extended objects in telescopes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the campaign approaches, NASA will continue preparations for the workshop and the subsequent monitoring of 3I/Atlas. The agency's operations may be affected by the ongoing government shutdown, impacting its ability to launch planetary defence initiatives.</p>
