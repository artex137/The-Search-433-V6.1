      <h2>Ancient Alien Comet 3I/ATLAS Erupts In Stunning Jet Blast As It Hurtles Toward Earth's Neighbourhood</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS has erupted in vivid jets as it travels through the solar system, with its closest approach to Earth expected on 19 December 2025. The comet, originating from another star, presents a unique opportunity for astronomers to study its unusual chemical composition, which may provide insights into the building blocks of planets.</p>

<p>Scientists have mobilized every available telescope to observe 3I/ATLAS. Its chemical signature, particularly the high ratio of carbon dioxide (CO₂) to water, challenges existing theories about comet formation. The findings could reshape our understanding of cosmic matter from outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025, approximately 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> October 2025, about 30 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>CO₂ to Water Ratio:</strong> Approximately 8:1</li>
    <li><strong>Size of Nucleus:</strong> Between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Key Observing Agencies:</strong> NASA, ESA</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Hubble Observations:</strong> 21 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Date of JWST Observations:</strong> August 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 21 July 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust around its icy nucleus. By August 2025, observations from the James Webb Space Telescope confirmed the gas cloud's high CO₂ content.</p>
<p>In October 2025, the comet made its closest approach to Mars, allowing orbiters to capture ultraviolet images. NASA scheduled a livestream event for 19 November 2025 to present data about the comet, which was delayed due to a US government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, a NASA scientist, stated, "It looks and behaves like a comet ... but this one came from outside our solar system, which makes it fascinating, exciting, and scientifically very important."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Unlike comets originating within our solar system, 3I/ATLAS provides a direct sample of the composition of another star system. Its unique chemical properties may reflect formative conditions that differ significantly from those in our own solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, ground- and space-based telescopes will continue to gather data. Scientists aim to analyze the comet's composition further to deepen their understanding of interstellar matter.</p>
