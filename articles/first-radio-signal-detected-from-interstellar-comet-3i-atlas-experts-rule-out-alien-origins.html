      <h2>First ‘Radio Signal’ Detected From Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS — Experts Rule Out Alien Origins</h2>

<p>Scientists using South Africa’s MeerKAT radio telescope have detected the first-ever radio waves from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which they confirmed are from a natural source. The signals were identified as the comet reached the midpoint of its journey through the solar system, with the comet first observed in July 2023.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the composition and activity of comets from outside our solar system. Researchers are now analyzing the implications of these findings for our understanding of interstellar objects and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Detection:</strong> MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> More than 210,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Next Close Approach:</strong> March 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Jupiter at Close Approach:</strong> 53 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmed Natural Source:</strong> Hydroxyl molecules (OH) from outgassing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023, traveling at a high speed toward the Sun. In October 2023, NASA scientists observed the comet emitting powerful jets of water. Recently, astronomers detected radio waves from the comet, which initially raised speculation about alien origins but were later confirmed to be from natural processes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we detect water — or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH — from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system. It tells us that the ingredients for life’s chemistry are not unique to our own,” said Dennis Bodewits, a physics professor at Auburn University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a researcher who has speculated about the comet being an alien spacecraft, noted the discovery of hydroxyl molecules in his personal blog.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This detection adds to previous findings of water on 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited unusual features such as a bright surface and an anti-tail. While some researchers have proposed extraterrestrial theories, the scientific consensus remains that the comet’s activity is entirely natural.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in 2026, where NASA’s Juno spacecraft will attempt to detect any radio signals at low frequencies.</p>
