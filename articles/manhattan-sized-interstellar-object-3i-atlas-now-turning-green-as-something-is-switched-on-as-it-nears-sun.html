      <h2>Manhattan-sized interstellar object 3I/ATLAS now turning green as something is ‘switched on’ as it nears Sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, measuring the size of Manhattan, is turning green as it approaches the Sun, according to scientists from the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile. The object has shown a significant increase in cyanide and nickel outgassing over the past two weeks, prompting experts to suggest that a process has been activated.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it marks a change in the object's physical characteristics, which have puzzled astronomers. Authorities are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the inner solar system, providing a unique opportunity for observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently turning green due to increased outgassing.</li>
    <li>The object is approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Recent observations have shown a rise in cyanide and nickel emissions.</li>
    <li>Experts describe the outgassing increase as “super-linear.”</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the first interstellar object to pass through the inner solar system.</li>
    <li>The likelihood of such a path is estimated at 0.02%, according to Dr. Avi Loeb.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, scientists have observed a notable shift in the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. Initially, the object exhibited no cometary tail, despite being categorized as a comet by researchers. Over the last two weeks, the outgassing of cyanide and nickel has increased dramatically, leading to its color change from red to green.</p>

<p>Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist tracking 3I/ATLAS, has provided insights into the process behind this change, suggesting a temperature-related activation that influences the object's surface and emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “What they mean is that there is a process with some minimum temperature in order for it to get activated,” said Dr. Avi Loeb. “Imagine that you want to buy a ticket to see a show. As long as you have a small amount of money in your pocket, you will not get in, but once you have more than some minimum, you will be able to see the show.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations of 3I/ATLAS did not indicate any typical cometary features, which has led to ongoing discussions among scientists regarding the nature of interstellar objects. The current observations provide a rare opportunity to study the behavior of such an object as it interacts with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it nears the Sun. Further studies will aim to understand the mechanisms behind the observed changes and their implications for our knowledge of interstellar objects.</p>
