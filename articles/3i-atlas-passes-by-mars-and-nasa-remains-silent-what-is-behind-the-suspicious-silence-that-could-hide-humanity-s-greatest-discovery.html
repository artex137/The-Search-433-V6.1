      <h2>3I/Atlas Passes by Mars Amid NASA's Funding Shutdown</h2>
<p>The interstellar object 3I/Atlas has passed within 30 million kilometers of Mars on October 3, 2025, but NASA has not provided updates due to a funding-related shutdown. The agency has faced criticism for its lack of communication during this significant astronomical event.</p>

<p>NASA's operational halt has led to widespread speculation about the implications of the 3I/Atlas encounter. As the object continues its trajectory, the scientific community and space enthusiasts are questioning the motives behind the agency's silence and the absence of real-time data on the interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's operational status:</strong> Shutdown due to lack of government funding</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery of 3I/Atlas:</strong> July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar visitors:</strong> 'Oumuamua and Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Next visibility:</strong> After October 29, 2025, when it will re-emerge from behind the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025 and identified as the third interstellar object to enter the Solar System. On October 3, it made its closest approach to Mars, coinciding with NASA's funding shutdown announcement. The agency halted updates on its website due to the lack of federal funding.</p>
<p>Despite the shutdown, NASA released two pre-scheduled images taken by the NavCam aboard the Perseverance rover days after the event. However, the agency has not confirmed whether the bright object in the photos is indeed 3I/Atlas.</p>
<p>On October 14, the European Space Agency (ESA) released images captured by Martian probes, although a full analysis is still pending.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, "Long delays are not a characteristic of 'alien intelligence' but rather of 'human stupidity on Earth.'" </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/Atlas event has sparked significant debate regarding the nature of interstellar objects. Avi Loeb has suggested that the object may be artificial, particularly noting the initial absence of a cometary tail, although later observations identified a tail. The lack of immediate responses from other space agencies, including the European Space Agency, the Chinese National Space Administration, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, has further fueled speculation about the true nature of the object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its journey, it will be hidden behind the Sun until October 29, 2025. The scientific community awaits further analysis from the ESA and other space agencies to clarify the characteristics and implications of this interstellar visitor.</p>
