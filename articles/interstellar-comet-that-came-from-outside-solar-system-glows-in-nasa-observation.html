      <h2>Interstellar comet that came from outside Solar System glows in NASA observation</h2>

<p>NASA has announced new findings from its SPHEREx mission, which recently observed the interstellar comet 3IATLAS between August 7 and 15, 2025. The comet, originating from beyond the solar system, continues to attract attention from astronomers as multiple NASA space telescopes examine its unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>The observations are significant as they provide crucial insights into the comet’s size, composition, and chemical makeup. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope have also focused on 3IATLAS, enhancing the understanding of this rare cosmic visitor. A detailed research note on these observations has been released, sparking scientific discussions within the community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet observed: 3IATLAS</li>
<li>Observation period: August 7 to 15, 2025</li>
<li>NASA missions involved: SPHEREx, James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope</li>
<li>SPHEREx mission purpose: Survey the entire sky in infrared wavelengths</li>
<li>Significance: Comets like 3IATLAS carry chemical signatures from distant star systems</li>
<li>Threat level: NASA states the comet poses no threat to Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between August 7 and 15, 2025, NASA’s SPHEREx mission conducted observations of the comet 3IATLAS. During this period, the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope also collected data on the comet, focusing on its surface chemistry and size estimation.</p>

<p>The findings from these observations have been compiled into a research note, which has been made publicly available. This has initiated discussions among scientists about the implications of the comet's characteristics for understanding planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa stresses that the comet poses no threat to Earth. Instead, it represents a rare opportunity to expand our understanding of the wider cosmic environment.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets like 3IATLAS are of particular interest to scientists because they act as time capsules from distant star systems. They carry material evidence of processes that occur around other stars, offering insights into the evolution of planetary systems outside our own. This is in contrast to comets from the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud, which are more familiar to astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA’s fleet of observatories will continue to track 3IATLAS, with researchers anticipating further results in the coming months. These findings will contribute to ongoing studies about the origins of planetary systems in the galaxy.</p>
