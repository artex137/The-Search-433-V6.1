      <h2>Potentially hostile alien threat is undergoing planetary defence exercise by UN</h2>

<p>A comet, known as 3I/ATLAS, has been confirmed by the United Nations (UN) as part of a planetary defence exercise. The exercise began on 29 October 2025, when 3I/ATLAS reached its closest approach to the Sun, travelling at approximately 246,000 kilometres per hour.</p>

<p>This exercise is significant as it provides an opportunity for the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) to conduct observational studies of the comet. While some experts suggest the comet could signify an alien presence, NASA has classified it as a comet, marking it as only the third interstellar object recorded to enter our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Travelling speed: approximately 246,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus diameter: between 0.32 km and a few km (exact size not disclosed).</li>
    <li>IAWN has conducted seven previous observing exercises since 2017.</li>
    <li>European Space Agency (ESA) is also monitoring 3I/ATLAS for planetary defence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025. It reached its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025. Following its discovery, the UN and IAWN confirmed that the comet is part of a planetary defence exercise. This exercise is designed to enhance observational capabilities for comets, which present unique challenges compared to asteroids.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While it poses no threat, comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and high interest to the scientific community,” the UN document states.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Even though 3I/ATLAS poses no threat, it was a valuable exercise for planetary defence,” said a representative from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University stated, “The truth is not decided by authority. NASA has no authority over nature to tell us what nature is.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The IAWN conducts annual exercises to improve global preparedness for tracking potentially hazardous objects in space. Comet 3I/ATLAS is particularly notable due to its interstellar origin and the ongoing debate among scientists regarding its nature. Previous exercises have focused on asteroids, which are typically easier to observe compared to comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists, including Professor Loeb, aim to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS by Christmas 2025. The ongoing monitoring by NASA and ESA is expected to continue as they assess the comet's trajectory and behaviour.</p>
