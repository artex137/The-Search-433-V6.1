      <h2>Astronomer and professor at Penn State University explains the significance of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, has made its closest pass of the sun, according to astronomers. The comet, which originated outside of our solar system, has been observed since July and will soon be visible to stargazers with telescopes as it departs from the solar system.</p>

<p>Christopher Palma, an astronomer and professor at Penn State University, discussed the importance of this event in an interview with News 8. Astronomers emphasize the significance of observing such interstellar objects to enhance our understanding of the cosmos.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the sun recently.</li>
    <li>It has been observed by astronomers since July 2023.</li>
    <li>Stargazers will soon be able to view the comet with telescopes.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to continue on its trajectory out of the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers first began observing the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. It has made its closest approach to the sun recently, marking a significant moment for celestial observation. As it continues on its path, astronomers are preparing for its visibility from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Observing interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS is crucial for understanding the origins of our solar system and the materials that exist beyond it,” said Christopher Palma, professor at Penn State University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of interstellar comets is rare, providing unique insights into the formation of celestial bodies. Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of the few interstellar objects that has been tracked as it passes through our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels out of the solar system, providing updates on its trajectory and visibility for stargazers.</p>
