      <h2>Second Comet ATLAS Turns Gold After Close Solar Encounter</h2>

<p>A newly discovered comet, C/2025 K1 (ATLAS), has developed a golden glow after reaching its closest point to the sun on October 8, 2023. The comet was found by astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in May 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it showcases the comet's unexpected resilience during its close approach to the sun, a journey that many experts expected would lead to its destruction. According to Spaceweather.com, the comet's transformation and survival could provide insights into the behavior of comets during solar encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: C/2025 K1 (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Discovery: May 2023 by ATLAS astronomers</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun (perihelion): October 8, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from the sun at perihelion: 31 million miles (50 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Current apparent magnitude: 9</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: November 25, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>May 2023: C/2025 K1 is discovered by astronomers at ATLAS.</p>
<p>October 8, 2023: The comet reaches its perihelion, coming within 31 million miles (50 million kilometers) of the sun.</p>
<p>October 29, 2023: Astrophotographer Dan Bartlett captures an image of C/2025 K1 showing its golden glow.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This comet was not supposed to survive its Oct. 8th perihelion," said astrophotographer Dan Bartlett. "But it did survive, and now it is displaying a red/brown/golden color rarely seen in comets."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 has largely gone unnoticed due to the attention surrounding interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered by ATLAS astronomers in early July 2023. Previous notable comets have shown distinct colors due to specific chemicals present in their comas, such as dicarbon or cyanide.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>C/2025 K1 will reach its closest point to Earth on November 25, 2023, and is expected to remain visible until early December. Observers can find it between the constellations Virgo and Leo in the eastern sky, particularly before sunrise.</p>
