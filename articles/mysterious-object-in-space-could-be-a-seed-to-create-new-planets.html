      <h2>Mysterious object in space could be a seed to create new planets</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered an interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, which has entered our solar system. The comet was spotted on July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. It is approximately 20 kilometres wide and is travelling at a velocity of roughly 60 km/s relative to the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because researchers believe that objects like 3I/ATLAS could play a crucial role in planet formation. A recent paper suggests that such interstellar objects may act as "seeds" for giant planets, providing new insights into how planets form around young stars. Authorities and scientists are actively studying the object to understand its origins and implications for planetary science.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered on: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately 20 kilometres wide</li>
    <li>Velocity: Roughly 60 km/s relative to the Sun</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors: 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov</li>
    <li>Research presented at: Joint Meeting of the Europlanet Science Congress and the Division of Planetary Sciences in Germany</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, detected the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, researchers have employed powerful telescopes to study its composition and origins. A recent paper presented at a scientific congress in Germany has proposed that interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS could serve as seeds for the formation of giant planets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Interstellar objects may be able to jump start planet formation, in particular around higher-mass stars,” said Dr. Susanne Pfalzner, the astrophysicist behind the recent research.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Interstellar space would deliver ready-made seeds for the formation of the next generation of planets,” Dr. Pfalzner added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery builds on previous findings related to interstellar objects. The first known interstellar object, 'Oumuamua, was observed in 2017. The study of such objects has increased in recent years, leading to new theories about their role in planetary formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Dr. Pfalzner and her colleagues are investigating how many captured interstellar objects could theoretically form into planetary bodies and how they might spread across the accretion disks of distant stars.</p>
