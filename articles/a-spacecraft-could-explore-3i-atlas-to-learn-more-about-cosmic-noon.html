      <h2>A spacecraft could explore 3I/ATLAS to learn more about 'cosmic noon'</h2>

<p>A spacecraft may soon explore comet 3I/ATLAS to gather information about the period known as "cosmic noon," which occurred approximately 2 to 3 billion years after the Big Bang. This exploration aims to enhance understanding of the rapid formation of stars and planetary systems during that era. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this mission.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS is significant for scientists seeking insights into the processes that contributed to planet formation and the emergence of life. Authorities have indicated that this mission could yield crucial data to advance knowledge in these areas.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS dates back to the cosmic noon period.</li>
    <li>The cosmic noon occurred 2 to 3 billion years after the Big Bang.</li>
    <li>Exploration aims to understand star and planetary system formation.</li>
    <li>No specific launch date for the spacecraft has been disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The cosmic noon period, which is of interest to scientists, took place 2 to 3 billion years after the Big Bang. This time frame is crucial for understanding the formation of stars and planets.</p>
<p>Details regarding the planned spacecraft mission are still being developed, with specific timelines and objectives not yet disclosed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The exploration of 3I/ATLAS could provide invaluable insights into the early universe,” said a spokesperson for the mission.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The cosmic noon represents a pivotal epoch in the history of the universe, marked by significant astronomical developments. Understanding this period is essential for researchers studying the origins of our solar system and life on Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further details about the spacecraft mission, including timelines and scientific objectives, are expected to be announced in the coming months.</p>
