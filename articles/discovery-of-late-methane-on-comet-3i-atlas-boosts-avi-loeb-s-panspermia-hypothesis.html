      <h2>Discovery of late methane on comet 3I/ATLAS boosts Avi Loeb’s panspermia hypothesis</h2>

<p>Researchers have confirmed the detection of late methane emissions from comet 3I/ATLAS, prompting renewed interest in Avi Loeb’s panspermia hypothesis. The discovery was made during observations in early February 2026, but details about the specific dates and locations of these observations have not been disclosed.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it may provide insights into the origins of life on Earth. Authorities and scientists are currently analyzing the data to better understand the implications of this discovery for astrobiology and the potential for life beyond our planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected methane emissions in early February 2026.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a prominent astrophysicist, supports the panspermia hypothesis.</li>
    <li>Details about the specific observation locations are not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Research teams are analyzing data to understand the implications for astrobiology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early February 2026, researchers observed emissions of methane from comet 3I/ATLAS. The detection has led to discussions surrounding the panspermia hypothesis, which suggests that life may spread through space via comets and meteoroids.</p>
<p>Following the discovery, scientists have begun detailed analyses of the comet’s chemical composition to explore its significance in the context of life's origins on Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of methane on comet 3I/ATLAS opens up new avenues for understanding the potential for life beyond Earth,” said Avi Loeb in a recent interview.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The panspermia hypothesis has gained traction in recent years, with various studies suggesting that comets and asteroids may have delivered essential building blocks for life to Earth. This new discovery could provide further evidence supporting this theory.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue their investigations into the chemical composition of comet 3I/ATLAS and its implications for astrobiology. Further studies are expected to follow as data becomes available.</p>
