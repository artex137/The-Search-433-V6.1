      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Approaches Perihelion, Expected to Reappear in November</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, as it travels through the solar system. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This comet has garnered significant attention from scientists and space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), as they study its origins, composition, and potential future visibility. Understanding 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the conditions of the early Milky Way and the formation of stars and planets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: 1.36 astronomical units (AU)</li>
    <li>Expected reappearance: November 11, 2025</li>
    <li>Visibility requirements: Telescope of at least 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter</li>
    <li>Estimated age: up to 7 billion years</li>
    <li>Maximum width: approximately 5.6 km</li>
    <li>Velocity: above 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. It is classified as the third interstellar object to enter our solar system, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, and was reported to have undergone rapid brightening before this event.</p>

<p>Scientists expect 3I/ATLAS to reappear around November 11, 2025. However, it will remain hidden behind the Sun from Earth’s perspective until early November. Observers will need powerful telescopes to view the comet after its reappearance, as it will not be visible to the naked eye.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The potential age and chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS make it a significant object of study,” said a NASA representative. “It may carry chemical traces from the early Milky Way, providing insight into conditions before the Sun’s formation.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>ESA stated, “The high velocity and limited time window make a mission to 3I/ATLAS technically impossible.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its hyperbolic orbit, which indicates that it does not revolve around the Sun like typical comets. This characteristic confirms its origin outside our solar system. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no danger to Earth and will maintain a safe distance as it travels.</p>

<p>Tracking efforts are coordinated by the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) and NASA to monitor the comet’s movement and behavior. This data will help scientists develop techniques to predict and potentially deflect hazardous objects in the future.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its expected reappearance, astronomers will prepare for observations using telescopes. NASA’s spacecraft orbiting Jupiter may also observe the comet when it passes near the gas giant in March 2026. The focus remains on studying the comet's dust and gas remotely using the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes.</p>
