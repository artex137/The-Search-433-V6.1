      <h2>Is the 3I/ATLAS Going to Hit Earth or Sun? See What Experts Say</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), known as 3I/ATLAS, has captured the attention of astronomers and the public since its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile. Concerns regarding its trajectory and potential impact on Earth or the Sun have emerged, but expert analyses indicate that the comet poses no collision risk.</p>

<p>Understanding the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is crucial as it is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the solar system. Authorities, including NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the European Space Agency (ESA), are actively monitoring its path and sharing findings to alleviate public concern.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (170 million miles or 270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion (closest approach to the Sun):</strong> October 30, 2025, at approximately 6.4 AU (600 million miles or 960 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Organizations Monitoring:</strong> NASA, ESA, International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Since then, astronomers have calculated its trajectory using data from various telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope. The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and will reach its perihelion on October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, it is expected to become brighter, providing opportunities for observation and study. Post-perihelion, astronomers anticipate the comet will be visible again in early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS has been meticulously calculated using observations from multiple ground- and space-based telescopes. Its closest approach to Earth is far too distant to pose any collision risk,” said Dr. Kelly Fast, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Near-Earth Object Observations Program.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Marco Micheli, an astronomer at ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre, stated, “The hyperbolic orbit of 3I/ATLAS means it is on a one-way trip through our solar system. Its closest approach to the Sun is far beyond the threshold for any significant gravitational or thermal interaction.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Amy Mainzer, a planetary defense expert at the University of Arizona, added, “Speculation about extraterrestrial origins often arises with interstellar objects due to their novelty, but 3I/ATLAS shows all the hallmarks of a natural cometary body.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to enter our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet's unique characteristics have generated public interest and speculation, particularly regarding potential extraterrestrial origins. Experts have refuted these claims, emphasizing its natural cometary features.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, NASA and ESA will continue to monitor its trajectory and study its composition. The comet's passage offers a significant opportunity for scientific research regarding interstellar objects and their role in the cosmos.</p>
