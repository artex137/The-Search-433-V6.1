      <h2>NASA Dismisses Harvard Astronomer's Theory of Interstellar Object as Extraterrestrial Artifact</h2>

<p>NASA has dismissed a hypothesis from Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb regarding Comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object discovered on July 1 in Río Hurtado, Chile. Loeb suggested that the comet could be a product of an advanced civilization and might pose a threat to humanity.</p>

<p>This matter has sparked debate within the scientific community. NASA monitors Comet 3I/Atlas and maintains that it poses no threat. Loeb's claims have raised questions about the nature of interstellar objects and their implications for understanding extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas) telescope.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide and traveling at 130,000 mph (209,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>It is the fastest-ever recorded visitor to the solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will not approach Earth closer than about 170 million miles during upcoming passes.</li>
    <li>NASA's lead scientist for solar system small bodies is Tom Statler.</li>
    <li>The comet has exhibited some unique features compared to other comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in Río Hurtado, Chile, marking its entry into the solar system. In July, Avi Loeb published a scientific paper suggesting that the comet may be an extraterrestrial artifact. Following this, he speculated in a blog post about the possibility of the object being deliberately sent toward Earth. NASA has monitored the comet through both ground-based and space telescopes since its discovery.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet behaves like a comet,” said Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for solar system small bodies. “Even though Comet 3I/Atlas has some unique features, it fundamentally behaves like its more familiar counterparts.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. The ability to identify such objects has increased, allowing scientists to explore the characteristics of other solar systems. Loeb's hypothesis has ignited discussions about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, although skepticism persists within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches other planets, including Mars, Jupiter, and Venus. Ongoing observations will enhance understanding of interstellar comets and their behavior.</p>
