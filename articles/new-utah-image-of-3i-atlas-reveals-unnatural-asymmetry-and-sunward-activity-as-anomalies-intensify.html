      <h2>New Utah Image of 3I/ATLAS Reveals Unnatural Asymmetry and Sunward Activity as Anomalies Intensify</h2>

<p>A new image captured on November 28, 2025, from a telescope in Utah has provided one of the clearest views of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, revealing anomalies that challenge traditional comet science, according to astronomer Roberto Colombari.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the object’s behavior and characteristics, which appear inconsistent with known comet dynamics. Authorities in the scientific community are analyzing the findings to better understand the implications for astrophysics and planetary defense.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: November 28, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Utah</li>
    <li>Astronomer: Roberto Colombari</li>
    <li>Key feature: Sunward-facing plume observed</li>
    <li>Previous observations: October and early November 2025</li>
    <li>Related comments: Michio Kaku on potential “extra energy” on October 30</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2025, NASA JPL’s Horizons data indicated an anomalous energy boost for 3I/ATLAS. This coincided with comments from physicist Michio Kaku regarding signs of potential extraterrestrial visitation.</p>

<p>Following this, multiple observations through November showed consistent anomalies in the object’s structure. The latest image from Utah, taken nearly a month after the energy boost, confirms earlier findings of stability and unusual features.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The structure is wrong for a comet. The direction of the activity defies solar physics,” said Roberto Colombari, emphasizing the anomalies observed in the latest image.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The implications cannot be ignored,” stated Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, raising questions about whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural object or something else entirely.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous images from October and early November 2025 showed similar characteristics, including rotational asymmetry and stability in form. The consistent observation across different platforms has led to increased scrutiny from the scientific community.</p>

<p>Comets typically exhibit chaotic behavior, including fragmentation and unpredictable jetting. In contrast, 3I/ATLAS displays signs that suggest controlled emissions and stability, prompting further investigation into its nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its most critical visibility window in December 2025. Researchers aim to refine perihelion modeling and address the anomalies presented by the new observations.</p>
