      <h2>Top intelligence officials to release evidence of alien activity in 2026</h2>

<p>United States intelligence officials are set to release evidence regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in 2026, according to reports from multiple sources. This announcement follows increasing pressure from whistleblowers, political forces, and new legislation aimed at revealing how the White House has managed information about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).</p>

<p>The upcoming revelations are significant due to the growing momentum in Congress, heightened whistleblower activity, and shifts in public perception. Experts suggest that maintaining secrecy on these matters may soon be impossible, especially after the release of the documentary *The Age of Disclosure* in November 2025, which featured testimonies from numerous military and intelligence personnel about a long-standing concealment operation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2026 is expected to see significant disclosures about UFOs.</li>
    <li>The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2026 mandates briefings on UAP incidents from 2004 onwards.</li>
    <li>Whistleblower David Grusch claims there are covert programs to retrieve and reverse-engineer extraterrestrial vehicles.</li>
    <li>Director Dan Farah's documentary features 34 military and intelligence personnel discussing concealment operations.</li>
    <li>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stated that unidentified objects have been observed over restricted nuclear facilities.</li>
    <li>Former Bank of England analyst Helen McCaw warns of potential economic impacts from UAP disclosures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2025, the documentary *The Age of Disclosure* is released, showcasing testimonies from military and intelligence personnel regarding a decades-long cover-up of UAP information. The release of this film has intensified calls for transparency from the government.</p>
<p>In 2026, the National Defense Authorization Act will require the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office to provide Congress with briefings on UAP incidents and to review the classification of related data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The fiscal year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act includes key provisions mandating the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office to brief Congress on UAP intercepts since 2004,” said filmmaker and researcher Mark Christopher Lee.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities - and it's not ours,” stated Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the documentary.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “UAP disclosure is likely to induce ontological shock,” cautioned Helen McCaw, emphasizing the potential for significant market volatility.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this upcoming revelation, the U.S. government has faced scrutiny regarding its handling of UAP information. The convergence of political, social, and legislative pressures has led to a renewed call for transparency. Recent whistleblower testimonies have further fueled public interest in the existence of non-human intelligence related to UAPs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 2026 approaches, investigations into UAP incidents will continue, with congressional briefings expected. The focus will remain on the potential for new disclosures, depending on political will and ongoing whistleblower activity.</p>
