      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Photographed by China’s Tianwen-1 Spacecraft</h2>

<p>China’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft has captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves across the Martian sky. The images, released on November 5, 2025, show the comet, which was first discovered on July 1, 2023, and is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed by humanity.</p>

<p>This achievement is significant for astronomers, as 3I/ATLAS is believed to have traveled across the cosmos for billions of years before entering our Solar System. The images provide fresh insights into the comet’s characteristics, which may help scientists understand its origins and journey through space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Tianwen-1 has been in orbit around Mars since February 2021.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is moving at approximately 58 kilometers per second (36 miles per second).</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be 10,000 to 100,000 times dimmer than objects on the Martian surface.</li>
    <li>The images reveal the comet’s nucleus and coma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2023. Initial observations confirmed it as a comet. Tianwen-1, designed primarily for imaging Mars, has adapted its instruments to capture images of the comet. The successful imaging occurred on November 5, 2025, showcasing the comet's unique features.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations made by Tianwen-1 are part of a broader effort to understand more about interstellar objects and how they interact with our Solar System,” said a representative from the China National Space Administration (CNSA).</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is an interstellar comet, providing scientists with a rare opportunity to study an object from another part of the galaxy. Its unusual trajectory and speed suggest it is a remnant from a different stellar system. The comet’s chemical composition and behavior, including an unusual anti-tail effect, have generated intense interest among astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue using Earth-based telescopes and space-based observatories like the European Space Agency’s Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. These efforts aim to gather more data on how interstellar objects behave as they approach the Sun.</p>
