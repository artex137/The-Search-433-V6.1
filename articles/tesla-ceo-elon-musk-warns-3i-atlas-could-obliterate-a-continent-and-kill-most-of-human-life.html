      <h2>Tesla CEO Elon Musk warns 3I/ATLAS could 'obliterate a continent' and 'kill most of human life'</h2>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has expressed concerns about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, stating it could cause catastrophic damage if it were to collide with Earth. Musk made these comments during an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast on November 17, 2023.</p>

<p>The warning comes as scientists continue to study 3I/ATLAS, which has been classified as a comet. Researchers from NASA and SETI have dismissed theories suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft. Authorities are monitoring the object's trajectory closely to ensure it remains on its predicted flight path.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 130,000 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong> 1.1x10<sup>-6</sup> astronomical units per day squared</li>
    <li><strong>Transverse Acceleration:</strong> 3.7x10<sup>-7</sup> astronomical units per day squared</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Figures:</strong> Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Avi Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies Involved:</strong> NASA, SETI</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed for approximately four months as it travels through the Solar System. The object reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 30, 2023. During this time, astronomers have debated its nature, with some suggesting it could be a comet and others proposing it might be an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>On November 17, 2023, during a podcast episode, Musk discussed the potential dangers posed by the object. He emphasized the need for continuous monitoring of its trajectory to prevent a possible collision with Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "If it struck Earth it would like obliterate a continent type of thing... Probably kill most of human life. If not all of us." 
    — Elon Musk
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "No, there are definitely comets and asteroids which are primarily made of nickel." 
    — Elon Musk
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS has sparked interest and debate within the scientific community. Avi Loeb's suggestion that it may be an alien 'mothership' has been met with skepticism. Most astronomers argue that the behavior of 3I/ATLAS can be explained through natural comet physics without the need for extraterrestrial explanations.</p>

<p>Previous near-Earth objects have raised similar concerns, prompting scientists and policymakers to enhance monitoring efforts and develop strategies to mitigate potential threats from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System. Authorities have committed to monitoring its trajectory to ensure it remains on course and does not pose a threat to Earth.</p>
