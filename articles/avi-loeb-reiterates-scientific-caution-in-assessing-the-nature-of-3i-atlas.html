      <h2>Avi Loeb reiterates scientific caution in assessing the nature of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard Professor Avi Loeb has reiterated the importance of a cautious scientific approach regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS in a recent blog post on Medium. Loeb stated that while he believes the object is most likely a natural comet, its anomalies necessitate careful monitoring as it approaches Earth.</p>

<p>This assessment is significant as it reflects ongoing scientific evaluation of 3I/ATLAS since its discovery in July 2025. Loeb has rated the object a 4 on the Loeb Classification Scale, which categorizes interstellar objects based on their characteristics. He has indicated he will not update this ranking until new data is available following its close approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery of 3I/ATLAS occurred in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb ranked 3I/ATLAS a 4 on the Loeb Classification Scale.</li>
    <li>Loeb identified eight anomalies in October 2025, which have since increased to 15.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Jupiter is expected on March 16, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. Shortly after its discovery, Avi Loeb applied the Loeb Classification Scale to the object, assigning it a rank of 4 due to the identification of eight anomalies. By October 2025, this number of anomalies had increased to 15. In a NewsNation interview on October 29, 2025, Loeb emphasized that while he believes the object is likely a natural comet, the potential for technological origins cannot be dismissed.</p>

<p>Loeb has stated that the most informative observations are expected around the object's closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026. These observations will be critical in determining the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is most likely a natural object, but we must remain cautious due to its anomalies,” said Loeb during a NewsNation interview. “No new data have yet prompted a revision of the Loeb Scale rank.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Loeb Classification Scale was developed to quantify interstellar objects based on their characteristics, ranging from natural icy bodies to potential alien technology. This scale has been applied in previous studies and is intended to evolve as new data becomes available. Loeb's methodology emphasizes rigorous scientific evaluation based on empirical evidence rather than media speculation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future conclusions regarding 3I/ATLAS will depend on the release and analysis of new observational data following its closest approach to Jupiter. Loeb has indicated that coordination among international observatories and space agencies will be essential for comprehensive measurements of the object.</p>
