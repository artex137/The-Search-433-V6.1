      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Baffles Scientists With Anomalies</h2>

<p>NASA's ATLAS telescope has detected 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet traveling at speeds up to 246,000 km/h, passing through the solar system on December 19, 2025. The comet, which is not expected to pose any threat to Earth, has shown unusual features that have sparked scientific debate and public fascination.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as only two other interstellar objects have been observed in our solar system. Scientists are currently analyzing its unique characteristics and trajectory to better understand its origins and the implications for future astronomical studies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It passed 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million km) from Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Its nucleus size is estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet reached a brightness of magnitude 11, four times more than predicted.</li>
    <li>Its escape velocity peaked at 246,000 km/h during its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations have revealed an X-ray halo and a green glow from specific gases.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibited a rare optical phenomenon known as an "anti-tail."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted by NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. It traveled through the solar system, confirming its interstellar origin with a hyperbolic trajectory. The comet reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, where it exhibited peak escape velocity. On December 19, 2025, it passed safely near Earth, allowing for unprecedented scientific observations and analyses.</p>

<p>During its journey, astronomers employed various telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, to study its features. Notably, the comet's unusual green glow was captured on November 26, 2025, and further observations revealed a higher nickel-to-iron ratio than typically seen in local comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS continues to behave as expected from natural astrophysical processes,” said the Breakthrough Listen team, which monitored the comet for potential alien signals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb remarked, “The odds of such an alignment occurring by chance are just 0.2%,” advocating for further scrutiny of the comet's characteristics.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects have been documented, making this encounter a significant opportunity for scientific discovery. The unique features observed in 3I/ATLAS, such as the anti-tail and unusual gas emissions, have generated interest in the nature of interstellar comets and their origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data collected from 3I/ATLAS to understand its composition and trajectory. Ongoing discussions in the scientific community will address the comet's anomalies and their implications for the study of interstellar objects.</p>
