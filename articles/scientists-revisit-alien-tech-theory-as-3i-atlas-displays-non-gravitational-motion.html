      <h2>Scientists Revisit ‘Alien Tech’ Theory as 3I/ATLAS Displays Non-Gravitational Motion</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system, has sparked renewed scientific debate following its close approach to the Sun in late October 2023. Astronomers have observed unexpected behaviors, including signs of non-gravitational acceleration and a notable color shift.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it echoes anomalies first noted in the 2017 interstellar object ‘Oumuamua’. Some researchers are revisiting theories that suggest explanations beyond traditional astrophysical processes. Authorities in the scientific community are now closely monitoring the object for further insights into its behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object in the solar system.</li>
    <li>Close approach to the Sun occurred in late October 2023.</li>
    <li>Researchers have observed non-gravitational acceleration.</li>
    <li>A color shift has been noted during the comet's approach.</li>
    <li>This behavior is reminiscent of the 2017 object ‘Oumuamua.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2023, Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun. During this time, astronomers began to observe unusual behaviors, including non-gravitational acceleration. The observations prompted researchers to compare the comet's characteristics with those of ‘Oumuamua, which had similarly sparked debate regarding its origins and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations of 3I/ATLAS have raised questions that echo those we faced with ‘Oumuamua. We must consider all possible explanations,” said an unnamed astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS and ‘Oumuamua has led to increased interest in the potential for non-natural phenomena in space. Previous studies of ‘Oumuamua highlighted the need for further investigation into the behavior of such objects, prompting ongoing discussions within the scientific community regarding their origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS for any further anomalies and will analyze its trajectory and composition to gather more information about its nature and origins.</p>
