      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth This December</h2>

<p>The Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, according to NASA. The comet will be approximately 170 million miles away, which is more than 700 times the distance between Earth and the Moon. There are no injuries or fatalities reported related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is the third object from outside the solar system to be discovered within it. NASA is actively observing the comet with various spacecraft and telescopes to gather information while it is in proximity to Earth. The agency has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to our planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Closest approach of Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Best viewed with a telescope of at least 30 centimeters aperture</li>
    <li><strong>Meteor Shower:</strong> Geminid meteor shower peaks on December 13 and 14</li>
    <li><strong>Conjunction:</strong> Moon and Jupiter conjunction on December 7</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 7, the Moon will appear close to Jupiter in the eastern sky during a conjunction. Skywatchers can find the bright planet just above and to the right of the Moon.</p>
<p>The Geminid meteor shower will peak on the evenings of December 13 and 14, allowing viewers to catch up to 120 meteors per hour under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>The closest approach of Comet 3I/ATLAS occurs on December 19, providing a unique opportunity for observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third object in history from outside of our solar system to be discovered within our solar system," said Chelsea Gohd from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"NASA continues to observe and study the object using a variety of spacecraft and telescopes," Gohd added. "This is a chance to learn as much as we can about it while it’s in our solar neighborhood."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of comets and their behavior provides important insights into the formation of our solar system. Comet 3I/ATLAS offers a rare opportunity for astronomers to analyze an interstellar object up close.</p>
<p>The Geminid meteor shower is a well-known event in the astronomical calendar, celebrated for its bright and colorful meteors. It is associated with the asteroid 3200 Phaethon.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue its observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS and will provide updates on its findings. Skywatching events may be organized to enhance public engagement with this astronomical event.</p>
