      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Transformed by Cosmic Radiation Over Billions of Years</h2>

<p>Researchers have found that comet 3I/ATLAS has undergone significant transformation due to cosmic radiation over billions of years in interstellar space. The study highlights the comet's outer layer, which has been chemically altered, while its interior remains closer to its original composition from its parent star system.</p>

<p>This discovery is important for understanding the processes that shape celestial bodies and the chemical evolution of comets. Authorities in the scientific community are now focusing on further observations and analyses to explore the implications of these findings for cometary science and interstellar chemistry.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has spent hundreds of millions to billions of years in interstellar space.</li>
    <li>Cosmic radiation has altered the comet's surface ices, creating new compounds.</li>
    <li>Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) detected high levels of CO₂ on the comet.</li>
    <li>Radiation-induced changes have resulted in a crust that traps volatile ices beneath the surface.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS shows both fresh volatiles (H₂O, CO) and a chemically unusual CO₂-rich outer layer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has likely spent billions of years drifting in interstellar space, where it was exposed to constant cosmic radiation. This radiation has gradually modified the comet's surface, breaking down molecular bonds and creating complex molecules. Laboratory simulations have demonstrated that cosmic-ray exposure can convert simple ices into more complex forms, including organics and carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>When 3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System, JWST measurements revealed its unusual chemical profile, with dominant CO₂ emissions alongside water, CO, and OCS. This profile is atypical for most comets, which usually release water first, indicating the role of radiation in altering its volatile inventory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Studying both layers makes 3I/ATLAS a rare scientific archive, shaped by two different histories: its birth around another star and its long, lonely voyage through the galaxy,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The findings on 3I/ATLAS align with known effects of cosmic radiation on other celestial bodies. Many distant Solar System objects exhibit similar darkening and reddening of their surfaces due to radiation exposure. The presence of radiation-generated organic material, known as “tholins,” is also observed in other comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further analyses of 3I/ATLAS to deepen their understanding of its chemical evolution and the implications for cometary studies. Future observations will aim to clarify the processes behind its transformation and the significance of its dual-layer composition.</p>
