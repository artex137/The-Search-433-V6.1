      <h2>A Steeply-Rising Production of Cyanide and Nickel Without Iron in the Gas Plume Around 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A recent study has reported an unusual detection of nickel without iron in the gas plume surrounding comet 3I/ATLAS, based on spectroscopic data from the Very Large Telescope. The findings indicate a significant anomaly, as natural comets typically exhibit both elements together. The research raises questions about the potential technological origins of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>This discovery is notable because nickel without iron suggests industrial processes rather than natural cosmic events. Researchers are exploring the implications of this finding, which aligns with earlier data from the SPHEREx space observatory and Webb space telescope, indicating a composition dominated by carbon dioxide and a lack of water. Authorities in the field are considering the potential for further investigations into the comet's origin and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery made using spectroscopic data from the Very Large Telescope.</li>
    <li>Nickel mass loss rate estimated at about <strong>5 grams per second</strong>.</li>
    <li>Cyanide mass loss rate estimated at about <strong>20 grams per second</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is located at a heliocentric distance of <strong>2.8 AU</strong> from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Power-law index for nickel loss: <strong>-8.43 (+/-0.79)</strong>.</li>
    <li>Power-law index for cyanide loss: <strong>-9.38 (+/-1.2)</strong>.</li>
    <li>Next significant observation scheduled for <strong>October 3, 2025</strong> with the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The detection of nickel without iron in the gas plume around 3I/ATLAS has been documented in a recent paper. The study utilized data from the Very Large Telescope to analyze the comet's composition.</p>
<p>Prior to this discovery, observations from the SPHEREx space observatory and Webb space telescope indicated that the gas plume is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with minimal water presence. This finding has raised questions regarding the comet's nature and potential technological influences.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The chemical formation through the nickel carbonyl channel is an extremely rare and exotic possibility in comets.” 
    — Research paper on 3I/ATLAS findings.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “What a wonderful and refreshing talk,” noted Emil Bohr, one of the conference organizers, during a discussion on 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of comets have shown that they typically release both iron and nickel, as both elements are produced during supernova explosions. The absence of iron in the gas plume of 3I/ATLAS represents a significant deviation from this norm. The findings from 3I/ATLAS contribute to ongoing discussions about the origins of interstellar objects and their potential technological implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations are anticipated as 3I/ATLAS approaches the inner solar system, with the next significant observation set for October 3, 2025. Researchers aim to capture detailed images of the comet to better understand its structure and composition.</p>
