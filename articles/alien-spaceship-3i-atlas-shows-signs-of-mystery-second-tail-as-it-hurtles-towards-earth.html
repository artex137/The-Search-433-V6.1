      <h2>'Alien spaceship' 3I/ATLAS shows signs of mystery second tail as it hurtles towards Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed signs of a possible second tail as it approaches Earth, according to astronomers monitoring its trajectory. The comet, which is currently located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, is expected to make its closest approach to Earth in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the comet’s composition and behavior. Scientists are studying the comet’s features to gain insights into its structure and the processes that govern its activity. Observatories worldwide have begun tracking the comet to gather more data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently located between Mars and Jupiter.</li>
    <li>The comet has shown signs of a potential second tail.</li>
    <li>It is expected to make its closest approach to Earth in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li>Astronomers from various observatories are monitoring its activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent observations, astronomers have noted changes in the comet's appearance, including the emergence of a second tail. The comet has been on a trajectory that brings it closer to Earth, prompting increased monitoring efforts. As it nears our planet, scientists aim to gather data that could provide insights into its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of a second tail suggests that there may be more to discover about 3I/ATLAS,” said a spokesperson from the observatory involved in tracking the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of many comets that have been studied as they approach Earth. Previous comets have shown similar phenomena, leading to greater interest in understanding their behavior and potential impacts. The study of comets contributes to our knowledge of the solar system and its history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its approach, astronomers will keep monitoring its activity for further developments. Additional observations are expected to provide more information on the comet's structure and behavior.</p>
