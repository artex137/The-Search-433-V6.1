      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS appears with tail in 28-hour video recorded by TESS</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been captured in a 28-hour video by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), showcasing its tail as it travels through our solar system. The video was recorded recently, but the exact date has not been disclosed.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides valuable data on the comet’s composition and trajectory. Scientists are studying the footage to learn more about the characteristics of interstellar objects and their behavior as they approach the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation duration: 28 hours</li>
    <li>Recording agency: Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)</li>
    <li>Location: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Comet type: Interstellar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2020. Its trajectory has been tracked through various observatories since then. The recent video captured by TESS adds to the growing body of evidence regarding the comet's path and physical characteristics.</p>

<p>Researchers have analyzed prior images of 3I/ATLAS to compare changes in its appearance, especially the formation of its tail, which is a result of solar radiation and solar wind.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This video provides a unique glimpse into the behavior of interstellar comets as they interact with our solar environment,” said a spokesperson from NASA's TESS program.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar comets, and its study contributes to the broader understanding of celestial objects that originate outside our solar system. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have sparked interest in the scientific community for their unusual properties.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the TESS footage to gather insights into the comet's structure and composition. Further observations are planned as 3I/ATLAS moves through the solar system.</p>
