      <h2>Harvard scientist slams study claiming 3I/ATLAS is a comet</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has criticized a study asserting that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS behaves like a comet, ahead of its scheduled flyby of Earth on December 19, 2025. The study, published in the Research Notes of the AAS, claims that 3I/ATLAS' non-gravitational acceleration aligns with typical comet behavior, a point Loeb strongly disputes.</p>

<p>The debate over the true nature of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it could influence scientific understanding of interstellar objects. Researchers from the aerospace firm Space Initiatives, led by Thomas Marshall Eubanks, argue that the object's behavior is consistent with that of comets, while Loeb insists that the study overlooks numerous anomalies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is set to fly by Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The study was published in the Research Notes of the AAS.</li>
    <li>Lead author is Thomas Marshall Eubanks from Space Initiatives.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has identified 13 non-cometary traits in 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the sun occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the sun. Following this event, the study claiming it behaves like a comet was published. The object is expected to fly by Earth tomorrow, prompting renewed discussion in the scientific community.</p>

<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is exotic and wonderful. It is also a comet,” said Eubanks.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Claiming that it, too, is a spacecraft does not fit the data,” Eubanks added.
</blockquote>

<p>Loeb countered, stating, “What they need to do... is explain the anomalies.” He has raised concerns over the high levels of nickel in the object's plume and its unusual trajectory.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This debate follows ongoing discussions in the scientific community regarding the classification of interstellar objects. Previous studies have suggested that unusual behaviors may indicate non-natural origins, leading to speculation about their nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into 3I/ATLAS are expected as it approaches Earth, with scientists continuing to analyze its characteristics and behavior during its flyby.</p>
