      <h2>New Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS Reveal "How Magical the Universe Could Be"</h2>

<p>NASA has unveiled new images of Comet 3I/ATLAS, which has excited researchers and amateur astronomers alike since its discovery on July 1, 2025. The comet, the third known object to enter our Solar System from outside, is currently moving further through the Solar System, and its images have been captured by multiple NASA missions.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it enhances understanding of interstellar objects. NASA has utilized various telescopes and spacecraft to gather data, contributing to a clearer picture of the comet's size, shape, composition, and trajectory. Researchers anticipate that ongoing analysis will yield more insights into this unique celestial visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>Notable Hubble Space Telescope image captured on July 21, 2025, from approximately 277 million miles away.</li>
    <li>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observed the comet on August 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx tracked the comet from August 7 to August 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>Psyche spacecraft captured images of the comet on September 8-9, 2025, from about 33 million miles away.</li>
    <li>Lucy spacecraft captured images from approximately 240 million miles away about a week later.</li>
    <li>Comet passed within 19 million miles of Mars, with images captured by MAVEN and HiRISE.</li>
    <li>Perseverance rover also captured a faint image of the comet from Mars' surface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS telescope. A notable image was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025. The JWST observed the comet on August 6, and SPHEREx tracked it between August 7 and August 15. The Psyche spacecraft captured images on September 8-9, and the Lucy spacecraft observed it about a week later.</p>

<p>During its journey, the comet came within 19 million miles of Mars, allowing Mars orbiters to capture additional images. The Perseverance rover on Mars also obtained a faint image of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Infrared light is particularly good at helping us understand the composition of objects. We can see little molecular fingerprints from the things that the objects are made of,"</blockquote>
<p>said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director of NASA’s Astrophysics Division, during a NASA press conference on November 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected by astronomers, following similar discoveries that have sparked interest in studying objects from outside our Solar System. Understanding these comets can provide insights into the formation and evolution of our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to analyze the data collected from various missions. Researchers aim to clarify when the comet entered the Solar System and to determine its age, which remains uncertain at this time.</p>
