      <h2>3I/ATLAS Revelation: UFO Researcher Unveils CIA Decision to Classify Interstellar Files</h2>

<p>A cryptic message from the CIA regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has sparked renewed speculation about its origins. The object, first discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, reached perihelion on 29 October 2025 and is now on a trajectory to exit our solar system. The CIA's classified response has raised questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which some researchers believe may be more than just a natural comet.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it challenges the official narrative provided by NASA, which has described 3I/ATLAS as an ancient piece of ice and rock. The CIA's decision to classify information about the object has prompted calls for transparency and further investigation into its true nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The CIA issued a 'Glomar' response on 31 December 2025 regarding records related to 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to be up to 14 billion years old.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed within 269 million kilometres of Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, first detected 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, the object underwent extensive observation and analysis by leading scientific institutions. By 29 October 2025, it reached perihelion, marking a key point in its trajectory. On 31 December 2025, the CIA responded to a Freedom of Information Act request from researcher John Greenewald Jr. with a classified statement regarding the object's records.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If the object is really just an 11-billion-year-old piece of space ice, why would the CIA keep records about it as secret as they would keep records about a secret operation?”</blockquote> — John Greenewald Jr.

<blockquote>“This is a wise policy for mitigating societal unrest or instability of financial markets at a time when the reality of a black swan event is still regarded as highly unlikely.”</blockquote> — Professor Avi Loeb

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CIA's 'Glomar' response, a term originating from a Cold War-era operation, has left many confused about why a natural comet is being treated with such secrecy. The scientific community has largely accepted 3I/ATLAS as a comet, but some researchers argue that its unusual characteristics warrant further investigation into its origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its encounter with Jupiter's moon Eupheme on 15 March 2026, researchers continue to call for transparency from the CIA and NASA regarding the object's true nature. The window to uncover more about 3I/ATLAS is closing as it exits our solar system.</p>
