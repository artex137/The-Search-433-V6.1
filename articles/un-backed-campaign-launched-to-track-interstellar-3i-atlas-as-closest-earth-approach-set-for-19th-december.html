      <h2>UN-backed campaign launched to track interstellar 3I/ATLAS as closest Earth approach set for 19th December</h2>

<p>On 24th October 2025, a United Nations-endorsed planetary defence coalition has begun a coordinated observing effort for the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, according to an announcement from the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN). The campaign is set to culminate with the object's closest approach to Earth on 19th December 2025.</p>

<p>This initiative marks the first time IAWN has formally targeted an interstellar visitor. The campaign aims to enhance astrometric techniques for tracking comets, which present challenges for accurate orbit predictions. IAWN will conduct a focused observation campaign from 27th November 2025 to 27th January 2026, with a preparatory workshop scheduled for 7th November 2025. This effort comes in light of the need for precise tracking ahead of 3I/ATLAS’s flyby.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> 19th December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign duration:</strong> 27th November 2025 to 27th January 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Workshop registration deadline:</strong> 7th November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Submission of White Paper:</strong> 30th September 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observing body:</strong> International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN)</li>
    <li><strong>Lead researcher:</strong> Avi Loeb</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 30th September 2025, Avi Loeb and colleagues submitted a White Paper to the United Nations. This document urged global coordination for observing interstellar objects. Following this, on 21st October 2025, IAWN announced its campaign during 3I/ATLAS’s solar conjunction.</p>

<p>The campaign will officially begin on 27th November 2025, with a workshop aimed at helping observatories improve their tracking capabilities. The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth will occur on 19th December 2025, with ongoing observations planned until 27th January 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comprehensive monitoring across ground and space assets will be essential in the weeks before and after the flyby,” said Avi Loeb in a commentary on Medium.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also noted, “The clearest technological indicator would have been any manoeuvre or the release of mini-probes near perihelion.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This campaign is significant as it represents a shift in how interstellar objects are monitored, reflecting an increasing awareness of potential risks and scientific opportunities. The unusual features of 3I/ATLAS, such as its trajectory and composition, have raised questions about its origins. Most researchers currently consider it a natural comet based on its observed behaviour.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN campaign is expected to refine orbit solutions and physical characterisation of 3I/ATLAS. The Galileo Project Observatories, led by Loeb, will monitor for any anomalous activity in near-Earth space over the coming months as a precautionary measure.</p>
