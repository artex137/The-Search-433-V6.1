      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS To Make Rare Appearance Tonight</h2>

<p>Astronomy enthusiasts can watch the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS live tonight at 11:15 pm ET, as it moves above the eastern horizon in the constellation Virgo. This comet, which is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, has captured the attention of scientists and sky-watchers since its discovery four months ago. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>The livestream will be hosted by The Virtual Telescope Project, according to The New York Post. The comet's unusual trajectory, which brought it close to Jupiter, Venus, and Mars during its perihelion, has sparked discussions regarding its origin and nature. High-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS are expected to be released by NASA next week, following a delay caused by a recent government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Event Time:</strong> Tonight at 11:15 pm ET</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream Host:</strong> The Virtual Telescope Project</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Above the eastern horizon in the constellation Virgo</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Magnitude +10.9 (invisible to the naked eye)</li>
    <li><strong>Special Equipment:</strong> High-powered telescopes required</li>
    <li><strong>Image Release:</strong> Expected next week from NASA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered four months ago and has since intrigued the scientific community and sky-watchers alike. It made its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, recently, passing near several planets including Jupiter, Venus, and Mars. The livestream event is set for tonight, allowing viewers to observe the comet in real time.</p>

<p>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS between October 1 and 7, which are anticipated to provide critical insights into the comet's structure and origin. The release of these images was postponed due to the recent government shutdown, which concluded last week.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The truth about 3I/ATLAS will only emerge through transparent data-sharing, not speculation,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb in a statement to The New York Post.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object detected in our solar system, following the discoveries of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. The unique characteristics of interstellar objects have led to increased interest and research in the field of astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following tonight's livestream, NASA is expected to release high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS next week, which could further illuminate the comet's features and origins as scientists continue to study this fascinating celestial visitor.</p>
