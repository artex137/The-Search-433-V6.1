      <h2>An interstellar comet is passing by Earth tonight—here’s how to see it</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar visitor, is passing through our solar system and will reach its closest approach to Earth in the early hours of December 19, 2025. This comet, which originated from another star, will not return after this flyby.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in its rarity; 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar objects detected to date. Space agencies and observatories worldwide have focused their instruments on the comet to study it, offering a unique opportunity to gain insights into planetary formation beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> 1 a.m. EST (6 a.m. GMT) on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 130,000 miles (209,000 kilometers) per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> requires a telescope; not visible to the naked eye</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> constellation Leo, near the star Regulus</li>
    <li><strong>Live stream:</strong> The Virtual Telescope Project, starting at 11 p.m. EST on December 18 (4:00 GMT on December 19)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in images taken in June 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The discovery was reported on July 1, 2025. Since then, various space agencies have observed the comet as it approaches Earth, marking a unique opportunity for scientific study.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, at 1 a.m. EST, the comet will make its closest approach to Earth. Observers will have the best chance to view the comet in the pre-dawn hours, particularly on the East Coast of North America.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a rare opportunity to examine material from outside our solar system,” said a NASA representative, highlighting the scientific importance of the comet's flyby.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar objects detected, making it a significant event for astronomers and space enthusiasts alike. Observations of such comets provide insights into the formation of planetary systems around other stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey through the solar system. The comet is expected to remain visible for several months, although it will fade over time. Observatories will continue to monitor its trajectory and characteristics during its flyby.</p>
