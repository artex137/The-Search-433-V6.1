      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS Really Moving? Viral Space Footage Claims ‘Unexplained’ Motion Fuelling Intense Cosmic Speculation</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has garnered attention after new videos and images surfaced online, leading to speculation about its motion. The footage, originating from various social media posts and mission trackers, has prompted viewers to question whether the comet is spinning as it makes its first and only journey through our solar system.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it has sparked lively debate among space enthusiasts and astronomers. Scientific agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have not verified the claims surrounding the comet's motion. Upcoming high-resolution images are expected to clarify whether the observed effects are genuine rotational behavior or mere imaging artifacts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet follows a hyperbolic orbit, meaning it is not bound to the Sun.</li>
    <li>It has been traveling at over 210,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed its closest point to the Sun on 30 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet made a flyby of Mars between 2 and 3 October 2025, at a distance of approximately 29 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Current claims of rotation remain unverified by scientific agencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope. Since then, it has been observed traveling at high speeds through the solar system. On 30 October 2025, it passed its closest point to the Sun. Between 2 and 3 October 2025, it made a notable flyby of Mars.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, videos and images have been shared online, suggesting possible rotational motion. These claims have not been substantiated by NASA or ESA, and discussions surrounding the comet's motion have intensified among viewers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The visuals circulating online are unverified, and no space agency has confirmed any rotational motion or unusual activity in 3I ATLAS,” a NASA representative stated. “Current claims are based on user-generated footage and should be treated as speculation until validated observations are released.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system, following 1I ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I Borisov in 2019. Its unique trajectory and composition make it a subject of scientific interest, particularly as it may contain high levels of carbon dioxide, which is typical of comets formed in extremely cold regions.</p>
<p>The comet's visibility has also drawn attention, as it cannot be seen with the naked eye and requires a medium-sized telescope for observation. Throughout November and December, enthusiasts can track it in the pre-sunrise sky.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa and ESA are expected to release new high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS during a scheduled live event, which may clarify the current claims and provide further insights into the comet's behavior.</p>
