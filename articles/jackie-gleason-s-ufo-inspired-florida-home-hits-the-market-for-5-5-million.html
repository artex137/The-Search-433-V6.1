      <h2>Jackie Gleason’s UFO-Inspired Florida Home Hits The Market For $5.5 Million</h2>

<p>Jackie Gleason's unique UFO-shaped estate in Cortlandt Manor, New York, has been listed for sale at a price of <strong>$5.5 million</strong>. The mansion, known as the Mothership, was designed by Gleason during the filming of The Honeymooners and completed in 1959. It has gained recognition as one of the most unusual celebrity homes.</p>

<p>The property is significant not only for its architectural style but also for its connection to Gleason, a prominent figure in American entertainment. Authorities have not disclosed any current plans for the estate beyond its listing on the market.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Cortlandt Manor, New York</li>
    <li>Asking price: <strong>$5.5 million</strong></li>
    <li>Size: 3,950 square feet</li>
    <li>Property area: 8.6 acres</li>
    <li>Completion year: 1959</li>
    <li>Architect: Robert Cika</li>
    <li>Initial construction cost: Approximately <strong>$650,000</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Jackie Gleason began designing his circular home in the 1950s, aiming to create a unique retreat that reflected his fascination with UFOs and the atomic age. The construction involved prefabrication work in an airplane hangar, which was then transported to the site. The assembly and finishing took five years, with significant financial backing from CBS.</p>
<p>In 1976, CBS sold the estate for <strong>$150,000</strong> following Gleason's relocation to Florida. The property returned to the market in 2018 with an asking price of <strong>$12 million</strong>, but it did not sell at that time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Mothership is a bold experiment in mid-century domestic architecture,” said a real estate agent familiar with the property.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Mothership has become a landmark of Gleason's legacy, reflecting his contributions to comedy, acting, and music. Gleason rose to fame as Ralph Kramden in The Honeymooners and hosted The Jackie Gleason Show, which was popular from the mid-1950s to 1970. His music career also flourished during the 1950s and 1960s, with multiple albums achieving significant commercial success.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The estate is currently listed for sale, and it remains to be seen if potential buyers will emerge following its recent price adjustment.</p>
