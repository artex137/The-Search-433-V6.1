      <h2>'The Age of Disclosure:' New Docu Claims US Government Hides Alien Tech, Not Just UFO Sightings</h2>

<p>A new documentary titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> claims that the United States government has concealed information regarding alien technology and non-human remains for approximately 80 years. The film, directed by Dan Farah, features testimonies from 34 former high-ranking officials in the military, intelligence, and aerospace sectors, and it premiered at the SXSW festival in March 2025.</p>

<p>The documentary has ignited discussions about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) and the potential existence of extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including former government officials, have been called upon to address the claims made in the film, which suggests that the topic is more complex than mere UFO sightings.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> was first showcased at the SXSW festival in March 2025. Following its premiere, discussions surrounding its claims have gained momentum. The film's assertions about the government's alleged cover-up have prompted calls for transparency from officials and the public alike.</p>

<p>Director Dan Farah has suggested that a sitting US president may soon acknowledge the existence of extraterrestrial life, indicating that the release of the documentary could be a catalyst for such an announcement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings,” said Jay Stratton, a former member of the US government's UAP task force.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is the atomic weapon on steroids,” Stratton added, comparing the implications of alien technology to the Manhattan Project.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I think it's only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, 'We're not alone in the universe,'” said Dan Farah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities and it's not ours,” stated Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the film's trailer.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary draws on a history of alleged concealment by US authorities regarding UAPs and possible extraterrestrial encounters. The involvement of prominent figures, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, highlights the seriousness of the claims presented in the film.</p>

<p>Critics have pointed out that while the documentary presents numerous personal accounts, the absence of solid physical evidence leaves many of the claims open to scrutiny.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions continue, there are calls for investigations into the claims made in <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>. Authorities may face increased pressure to release classified information related to UAPs and extraterrestrial technology.</p>
