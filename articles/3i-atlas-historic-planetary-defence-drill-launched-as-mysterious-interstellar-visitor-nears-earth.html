      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Historic planetary defence drill launched as mysterious interstellar visitor nears Earth</h2>

<p>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, October 6, 2023, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event, as officials have confirmed there is no risk of collision.</p>

<p>This approach presents a rare opportunity for space agencies to test their planetary defence measures. Authorities are utilizing this event to evaluate their readiness in the event of a future threat from an asteroid or comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 6, 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach distance: 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Risk of collision: None</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: Not disclosed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed by astronomers since its discovery, but its closest approach marks a significant moment for planetary defence initiatives. This event has been planned for some time, aligning with ongoing efforts to enhance global readiness for potential interstellar threats.</p>

<p>The approach allows space agencies to conduct drills and simulations, which are crucial for understanding the capabilities and limitations of current technologies aimed at protecting Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This distance poses no collision risk whatsoever,” officials have confirmed.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this drill, various agencies have conducted simulations and tests to prepare for potential asteroid impacts. The increasing frequency of asteroid discoveries has heightened the focus on planetary defence strategies globally.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the closest approach of 3I/ATLAS, space agencies will analyze data collected during the event to improve their planetary defence protocols and readiness for future threats.</p>
