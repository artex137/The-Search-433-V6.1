      <h2>Cosmic visitor 3I/Atlas begins its final journey out of the solar system after passing by Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has started its outward journey from the solar system after its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet passed at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers from our planet, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>This event has significant implications for the scientific community. The passage of 3I/Atlas has provided a unique opportunity to study primordial material from a distant star system. Observatories around the world mobilized to gather data on the comet's composition and origin during its brief stay in the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/Atlas first identified on July 1, 2025.</li>
  <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
  <li>Passed at a distance of about 270 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
  <li>Estimated diameter of the comet's core is between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
  <li>Speed of the comet exceeds 200,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
  <li>Perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, was on October 29, 2025, at about 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
  <li>Predicted to cross the limits of the solar system in the 2030s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first identified by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) automated search system in Chile on July 1, 2025. Its unusual speed and trajectory prompted further investigation, confirming its interstellar origin. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, and increased in brightness due to solar heating.</p>

<p>After passing the Sun, 3I/Atlas moved toward Earth, where it made its closest approach on December 19, 2025. This event allowed scientists to analyze the sunlight reflected off its coma and tail from various angles.</p>

<p>Following its passage, astronomers have focused on monitoring the comet's trajectory and behavior as it moves away from the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/Atlas represents a unique opportunity for the scientific community,” said an astronomer involved in the observations. “We are analyzing a vast volume of information obtained during its brief stay.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object confirmed to visit the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike those predecessors, 3I/Atlas has exhibited distinct features that provide insights into the diversity of objects in the Milky Way. Its composition, rich in complex organic compounds, offers clues about the conditions in which it formed.</p>

<p>The comet's passage has also involved advanced astronomical instruments, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, which have provided high-resolution images and chemical composition analysis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to refine the comet's ejection orbit and monitor any subtle changes in its behavior until it disappears into interstellar space, likely in mid-2026. The data collected will contribute to ongoing studies of interstellar objects and the formation of planetary systems.</p>
