      <h2>Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer Captures Data from Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) has captured data from interstellar comet 3I/Atlas during its mission for the European Space Agency (ESA), which began in April 2023. The unexpected encounter occurred while JUICE was in its cruise phase, aimed at the moons of Jupiter.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study an object from outside the solar system. The data collected may offer insights into the formation of both the comet and the solar system itself. ESA has stated that teams throughout Europe are currently analyzing the data returned from the encounter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mission launched: April 2023</li>
    <li>Comet encountered: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Distance from the sun: not disclosed</li>
    <li>Mission duration: eight years</li>
    <li>Instruments aboard JUICE: 10</li>
    <li>Primary goals: Explore Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In April 2023, JUICE launched with the goal of exploring Jupiter's icy moons. During its cruise phase in autumn 2023, the spacecraft unexpectedly encountered comet 3I/Atlas. Engineers modified JUICE’s instruments mid-flight to collect data on the comet, which is noted as the third known interstellar visitor to the solar system.</p>

<p>The spacecraft utilized its high-gain antenna as a makeshift shield against the sun’s rays while observing the comet. Data collection began immediately after the encounter, and analysis of the chemical traces and spectra is ongoing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This unexpected comet encounter demonstrates the mission’s flexibility and responsiveness,” ESA stated in a recent update. “It emphasizes how well-made tools frequently benefit us in unexpected ways.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is notable as it is one of the few known interstellar objects to pass through our solar system. Previous missions have focused on planetary exploration, making JUICE's focus on icy moons a significant shift in scientific exploration. The mission aims to provide a cohesive narrative about the moons' formation, composition, and potential for supporting life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As data analysis continues, ESA plans to keep JUICE on track for its primary mission objectives, which include a detailed exploration of Jupiter's moons. The mission will also work in tandem with NASA’s Europa Clipper, expected to complement its findings.</p>
