      <h2>Four Glowing Orbs Spotted Over Duluth And Superior On Christmas Eve</h2>

<p>Four glowing orbs were spotted hovering in a diamond formation over Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin, around 6 p.m. on December 24, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The sightings have drawn attention due to the unusual nature of the orbs, prompting witnesses and enthusiasts to question their origin. Authorities have not confirmed any explanations, leading to increased interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in the region.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Time of sighting: 6 p.m. on December 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin</li>
    <li>Number of orbs: Four</li>
    <li>Duration of hover: Approximately 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Multiple, including a witness named Paul</li>
    <li>Observation method: Duluth Harbor Camera</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At around 6 p.m. on December 24, 2025, multiple witnesses observed four glowing orbs in the sky. The orbs hovered in a diamond formation for about 10 minutes. Witness Paul reported seeing the lights while parked off Highway 105 in South Superior. After 10 minutes, three of the orbs departed, while one orb remained visible for a few more minutes. Witnesses noted that the orbs did not resemble typical drones or Starlink satellites.</p>

<p>Witness Paul reached out to other observers and experts, including Chris Bledsoe, a known UFO experiencer, to compare notes and footage. Bledsoe confirmed the orbs resembled those he has previously documented.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The lights don’t look like drones; they don’t have any of the navigation lights. Also, why would someone be operating four drones in a single area at night?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Many UFO or UAP sightings are easily solved as Starlink Satellites. However, these are definitely not Starlink.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena have increased in recent years, raising questions about their nature and origin. While many can be attributed to known technology, such as Starlink satellites, this sighting's characteristics have led some to believe it may be something different.</p>

<p>Authorities and researchers have expressed a growing interest in studying UAPs, as public curiosity and reported sightings rise.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for further investigation into this specific sighting. However, interest in UAPs continues to grow, prompting ongoing discussions among enthusiasts and researchers alike.</p>
