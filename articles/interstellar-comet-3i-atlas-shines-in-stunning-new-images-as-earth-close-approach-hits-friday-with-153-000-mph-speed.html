      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3i ATLAS Approaches Earth at High Speed</h2>
<p>Interstellar Comet 3i ATLAS has captivated the scientific community with new images released by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) as it approaches Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet, traveling at approximately <strong>245,000 kilometres per hour</strong>, is expected to pass within about <strong>167 million miles</strong> (270 million kilometres) of our planet.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The close approach of Comet 3i ATLAS offers a rare opportunity for astronomers to study an interstellar object in detail. The latest images highlight the comet's unique features, including its dual tail system, which consists of dust and plasma. Scientists aim to understand the chemical processes occurring on the comet's surface as it interacts with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025, by NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile</li>
  <li><strong>Earth approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> Approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 153,000 miles per hour (245,000 kilometres per hour)</li>
  <li><strong>Latest images:</strong> Released December 8-9, 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Requires telescopes with at least 30cm aperture</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3i ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. On November 30, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet, revealing a glowing halo of gas surrounding its icy nucleus. As the comet approaches Earth, astronomers have noted high activity levels, with jets of material streaming from its surface.</p>

<h2>Official Statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “The images showcase the comet’s distinctive dual tail system composed of both dust and plasma material,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This rare interstellar visitor provides a unique opportunity to observe the effects of solar heating on its surface.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3i ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar comets to pass through our solar system. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua in 2017, have sparked significant interest and research into the origins and composition of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and activity. Further observations and studies are planned to better understand its composition and the processes occurring as it nears the Sun.</p>
