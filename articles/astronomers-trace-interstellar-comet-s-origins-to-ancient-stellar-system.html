      <h2>Astronomers trace interstellar comet’s origins to ancient stellar system</h2>

<p>On 26th October 2025, Spanish astronomers confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS, currently moving through our solar system, contains material that predates the formation of our Sun. Researchers from the University of A Coruña’s Centre for Research in Information and Communication Technologies (CITIC) have established that this interstellar object originated from a distant stellar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study primordial matter from outside our galaxy. Astronomers have emphasised the potential for research on such celestial bodies, noting that each interstellar comet serves as a natural time capsule, offering insights into the chemical building blocks of exoplanets and the conditions surrounding their formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1st July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet’s trajectory has been traced back over ten million years.</li>
    <li>It will approach no closer than 270 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
    <li>Analysis of the comet's composition is expected to provide insights into exoplanet formation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by ATLAS on 1st July 2025. Following its discovery, researchers began analysing its unique trajectory and composition, which distinguished it from other solar system objects.</p>

<p>Using advanced orbital modelling and data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, scientists successfully traced the comet's path back through ten million years of cosmic history. This analysis has allowed researchers to understand its origins and significance in studying primordial matter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Each interstellar comet acts as a natural time capsule, preserving chemical signatures from its parent system,” said a spokesperson from the University of A Coruña’s CITIC.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS has garnered attention in the scientific community due to their potential to reveal information about the early conditions of the universe. Prior to this, only two interstellar visitors have been confirmed, making 3I/ATLAS a significant addition to ongoing research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue detailed spectroscopic studies of 3I/ATLAS as it passes through our solar system, taking advantage of the extended observation window it presents.</p>
