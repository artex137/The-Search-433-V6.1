      <h2>Are the Jets from 3I/ATLAS Pulsed Like a Heartbeat?</h2>

<p>Researchers have observed pulsating jets emanating from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, detected on July 1, 2025, with the latest findings reported on November 29, 2025, from Rayong, Thailand. The jets display a periodic variability with a cycle of 16.16 hours, although no injuries or fatalities are associated with this astronomical phenomenon.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may help scientists understand the behavior of comets and the mechanisms behind their activity. Researchers are currently analyzing the jets and their potential connections to the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS, which appears to have an ellipsoidal shape. The observations have prompted further investigations into the structure and dynamics of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detection date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Latest observations: November 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observations: Rayong, Thailand</li>
    <li>Period of variability: 16.16 hours</li>
    <li>Estimated effective radius of nucleus: 10 km in visible light</li>
    <li>Outflow velocity of jets: 440 m/s</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Following this, on July 21, 2025, a Hubble Space Telescope image provided insight into the object's structure, revealing a glowing halo around it, known as a coma. Observations over the subsequent months indicated the presence of multiple jets, culminating in the recent findings reported on November 29, 2025.</p>

<p>During this period, researchers noted that the light from 3I/ATLAS exhibited pulsating variability, with amplitudes reaching tens of percent. The periodic nature of the jets has led to comparisons with a heartbeat, suggesting a potential relationship between the jets and the nucleus's rotation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The periodic variability observed in the jets might be linked to the nucleus's rotation and the sublimation of volatiles,” said Avi Loeb, a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first instance of unusual behavior observed in comets. Previous studies have shown that other comets exhibit similar jet activity, often linked to the sublimation of ice when exposed to sunlight. The findings regarding 3I/ATLAS contribute to a broader understanding of the dynamics of interstellar objects and the processes that govern their activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its jets and the underlying mechanics of its nucleus. Further analysis is expected to clarify the relationship between the object's rotation and the observed variability in its light output.</p>
