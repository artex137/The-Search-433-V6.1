      <h2>If UFOs Could Disclose Tomorrow, Why Haven’t They?</h2>

<p>Author Steve Foley has released a new book titled <strong>Contact Deferred: Silence, Strategy, and the Truth Behind Non-Disclosure</strong> on August 25, 2025, in Huntington Beach, California. The book explores the question of why UFO disclosure has not occurred, despite the potential for it to happen.</p>

<p>This work is significant as it shifts the focus from traditional UFO topics such as sightings and government cover-ups to the silence surrounding the phenomenon. Foley's approach considers whether this silence may be part of a deliberate strategy. The book has already gained traction on Amazon, breaking into the Top 100 Science Essays & Commentary rankings.</p>
