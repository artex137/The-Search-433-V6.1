      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Will Make Its Closest Approach To Earth This Month, Just 270 Million Kilometers Away</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing at a distance of 270 million kilometers (168 million miles). The comet will be visible to amateur astronomers equipped with small telescopes or binoculars.</p>

<p>This event is significant because 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, have indicated that the comet poses no threat to Earth and will provide a unique opportunity for observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
  <li>Distance at closest approach: 270 million kilometers (1.8 AU)</li>
  <li>Speed at closest approach: 246,000 kilometers per hour (153,000 miles per hour)</li>
  <li>Diameter of the comet: between 440 meters (1,400 feet) and 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles)</li>
  <li>Previous close encounter with Mars: October 3, 2025, at 29 million kilometers (18 million miles)</li>
  <li>Next close encounter with Jupiter: March 16, 2026, at 53 million kilometers (33 million miles)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) discovered 3I/ATLAS traveling through the Solar System. It was confirmed as an interstellar comet shortly thereafter. Observations from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope on August 20, 2025, provided estimates of the comet's size.</p>
<p>The comet reached its perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, increasing its speed to approximately 246,000 kilometers per hour (153,000 miles per hour). Its closest encounter with Mars occurred on October 3, 2025, before it heads towards Earth for its upcoming approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The closest the comet will come to Earth is about 270 million km – that’s about 1.8 times the distance between Earth and the Sun,” said a representative from the European Space Agency. “It poses no danger to our planet or any other planets in the Solar System.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is a time capsule from another age of the universe, potentially 10 billion years old. It is distinct from Solar System comets and has shown signs of cryovolcanism. Previous interstellar objects have raised questions about the potential threats they may pose; however, astronomers have reassured the public regarding the safety of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach to Earth, 3I/ATLAS may encounter Jupiter on March 16, 2026. Observers will continue to monitor its trajectory and any changes that may result from gravitational influences or outgassing events.</p>
