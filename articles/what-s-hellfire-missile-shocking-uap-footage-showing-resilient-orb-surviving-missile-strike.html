      <h2>US Drone Fires Hellfire Missile at UAP Orb—But It Survives</h2>

<p>A U.S. military drone has failed to destroy an unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) off the coast of Yemen, according to a congressional hearing on September 10, 2025. The footage showed an MQ-9 Reaper drone launching a Hellfire missile at a spherical object, which continued on its trajectory unharmed.</p>

<p>The incident has raised significant concerns among lawmakers regarding UAPs and the government's transparency about them. During the House Oversight subcommittee session, witnesses, including U.S. Air Force veterans, confirmed that no known U.S. technology could withstand such an attack. The hearing aimed to enhance public trust through increased transparency on UAPs, with calls for further release of classified materials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: September 10, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Weapon used: AGM-114 Hellfire missile</li>
    <li>Drone type: MQ-9 Reaper</li>
    <li>Key witnesses: Jeffrey Nuccetelli, Alexandro Wiggins, Dylan Borland</li>
    <li>Congressional body: House Oversight subcommittee on UAP transparency</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the congressional hearing, Representative Eric Burlison of Missouri presented the video footage of the missile strike. The clip showed the Hellfire missile impacting the orb, which did not sustain any damage. Witnesses at the hearing confirmed the unusual resilience of the object, stating that it defied current military capabilities.</p>
<p>In addition to the missile incident, witnesses recounted previous encounters with UAPs, including a 2003 incident at Vandenberg Space Force Base and a report of a “Tic Tac”–shaped craft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That was a Hellfire missile striking the orb, and it simply carried on as if nothing happened,”</blockquote> said veteran journalist George Knapp. 
<blockquote>“No technology in the U.S. arsenal is known to withstand such an attack,”</blockquote> confirmed the witnesses during their testimonies.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a larger trend of increasing scrutiny on UAPs by U.S. lawmakers. The House Oversight subcommittee has been focused on improving transparency and restoring public trust regarding government knowledge of these phenomena. The unsettling nature of the footage has amplified calls for the release of more classified information.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers are expected to continue pressing for the release of additional classified footage and documentation related to UAPs. The ongoing discussions aim to provide the American public with more clarity on what the government knows about these unidentified phenomena.</p>
