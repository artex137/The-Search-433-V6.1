      <h2>Atypical radio signal from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS puts space agencies on alert</h2>

<p>The passage of comet 3I/ATLAS, identified on July 1, 2025, has prompted a global scientific mobilization among space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). This interstellar object, detected by the ATLAS survey system, generated a significant response due to its unusual and continuous radio emissions, later confirmed to be of natural origin.</p>

<p>The comet's unique trajectory and behavior have raised interest among scientists, who are now focused on studying its chemical composition and the environment from which it originated millions of years ago. The international collaboration has employed a global network of observatories to monitor the comet during its brief passage through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object travels at approximately 100,000 km/h relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>It has an estimated core size between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa recorded a consistent radio emission from the comet on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>The signal frequency was recorded at 1.6 GHz, corresponding to hydroxyl molecules (OH).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected comet 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS survey system at the observatory in Río Hurtado. Following its identification, scientists calculated its orbit and speed, confirming its hyperbolic trajectory, indicative of an extrasolar origin.</p>

<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope captured a remarkable radio emission from the comet, leading to further investigation. This emission validated the classification of 3I/ATLAS as an active comet and provided new data on the sublimation of water on its surface.</p>

<p>The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a safe distance, allowing scientists to conduct detailed analyses without any collision threat.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The passage of 3I/ATLAS serves as a valuable exercise to test and improve global response systems and real-time data analysis,” a NASA spokesperson said.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed by scientists, joining 1I/’Oumuamua, detected in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, observed in 2019. Each of these objects provides insights into the formation of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<p>The unusual radio emissions of 3I/ATLAS distinguish it from previous interstellar visitors and highlight the significance of monitoring systems like ATLAS, which are essential for detecting and analyzing unexpected celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey into deep space, scientists will maintain observations to track variations in the composition of its coma and the reflectivity of its core. This data will contribute to understanding how the Sun's heat affected the comet's internal structure during its passage through the Solar System.</p>
