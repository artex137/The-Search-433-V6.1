      <h2>3I/ATLAS Cover-Up? Avi Loeb Slams NASA for 'Burying the Evidence', Calls ESA 'More Honest' About Alien Findings</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has accused NASA of suppressing evidence regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is set to reach its closest point to the Sun on 29 October. Loeb believes the object could potentially be an alien spacecraft and criticized NASA for its handling of data related to 3I/ATLAS while praising the European Space Agency (ESA) for greater transparency.</p>

<p>This controversy matters because it highlights the ongoing debate about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and the scientific community's differing opinions on its classification. As 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion, authorities and scientists are closely monitoring the object to gather more data and evidence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> 29 October 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Opposite side of the Sun from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Theorist:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astronomer</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's Position:</strong> Claims 3I/ATLAS is a comet</li>
    <li><strong>ESA's Position:</strong> Viewed as more transparent regarding findings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has raised concerns about 3I/ATLAS since its discovery, suggesting that its unusual characteristics warrant further investigation. In September 2023, Loeb stated that the object might utilize the Sun's gravitational pull to adjust its velocity. He posited that if it were a spacecraft, it could release smaller probes to explore the Solar System.</p>
<p>On 29 October 2023, 3I/ATLAS will reach its perihelion, during which time Loeb claims it may be optimal for any potential velocity adjustments. This timing coincides with the object being out of sight from Earth-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb said, "If you want to take a vacation, take it before [October 29], because who knows what will happen?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also stated, "Science is guided by evidence and not by expectations," emphasizing the need for ongoing observation of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for solar system small bodies, countered, "It looks like a comet. It does comet things."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflects broader discussions in the scientific community about the classification of anomalous astronomical objects. Loeb's theories have sparked skepticism, with many experts advocating for a more conservative interpretation of the data. Previous incidents of unusual celestial objects have often led to speculation about extraterrestrial origins, but mainstream science has typically favored natural explanations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion, scientists will continue to monitor the object closely. Loeb has indicated that further observations will be critical in November and December 2025 to assess any unusual activity related to 3I/ATLAS or potential new objects that may emerge.</p>
