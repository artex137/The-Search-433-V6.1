      <h2>What Is the Buga Sphere? A Bizarre Metallic Object Allegedly Linked to Alien UFO</h2>

<p>Residents of Buga, Colombia, have reported a strange metallic sphere drifting in the sky since early March. The object was first seen on March 2, 2025, and moved in zig-zag patterns, prompting curiosity and concern among locals and scientists alike. After descending near the town, the sphere has attracted global attention due to its unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>The Buga Sphere's discovery has sparked interest in the scientific community, with researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico conducting examinations. Initial findings include the object's metallic layers and a unique internal structure that may interact with gravitational forces. Authorities and scientists are now focusing on further testing to determine the sphere's origin and properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First sighted on March 2, 2025, near Buga, Colombia.</li>
    <li>Collected by researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.</li>
    <li>Weight increased from 7.3 kg (16 lbs) to 10 kg (22 lbs) over time.</li>
    <li>Reported to have three metal layers covering a central core.</li>
    <li>Discovered site exhibited dry soil and dead grass.</li>
    <li>Microscopic scans revealed fibre optic-like lines inside the sphere.</li>
    <li>Study titled "A Unified Framework for the Buga Sphere" released by researcher P Morcillo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On March 2, 2025, multiple witnesses observed a luminous metallic sphere descending in the skies above Buga, Colombia. Following its landing, researchers collected the object for analysis. Experts from the National Autonomous University of Mexico began their examination shortly thereafter, unveiling details about its structure and possible functions.</p>
<p>By mid-July 2025, findings included reports of the object producing a cooling effect and possibly interacting with gravitational forces. Discussions among scientists have emerged regarding the implications of these characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sphere may have produced a decaying ionised field,” said engineer Rodolfo Garrido during a press event hosted by Jaime Maussan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We need proper testing before concluding anything about the object,” said a representative from the Galileo Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior incidents involving unusual aerial phenomena have led to increased scrutiny and interest in unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The scientific community has called for more rigorous testing and standardized protocols for analyzing such occurrences, especially as they gain attention globally.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers from various organizations, including the Galileo Project and the UAP Disclosure Fund, plan to conduct further tests on the Buga Sphere. Their goal is to gather more information and determine the object's nature before drawing any conclusions about its origins or implications.</p>
