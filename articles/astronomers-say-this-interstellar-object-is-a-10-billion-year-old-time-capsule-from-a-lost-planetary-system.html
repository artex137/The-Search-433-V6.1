      <h2>Astronomers Track Ancient Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected a mysterious interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, speeding through the Solar System, and they believe it may be a 10-billion-year-old time capsule from an ancient planetary system. The object, which measures approximately 5.6 kilometers across and weighs over 33 billion tons, was first spotted on July 1 as it moved through space at nearly twice the speed of previous interstellar visitors.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it could provide insights into the early formation of the galaxy and the building blocks of planetary systems. A research team from the University of A Coruña has utilized data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission to study the object’s trajectory and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately 5.6 kilometers across</li>
    <li>Weight: Over 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 10 billion years</li>
    <li>First detected: July 1</li>
    <li>Velocity: Nearly twice that of previous interstellar objects</li>
    <li>Research team: University of A Coruña</li>
    <li>Data source: European Space Agency’s Gaia mission</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS as it entered the Solar System. The object’s high velocity and size quickly distinguished it from other known comets. Researchers tracked its path even as it moved behind the Sun from Earth’s perspective. The team from the University of A Coruña has since simulated its trajectory using a dataset of over 13 million stars, leading to conclusions about its origin and journey.</p>

<p>Experts found that 3I/ATLAS has avoided any significant stellar encounters for the last 10 million years, with only 93 potential encounters recorded within 2 parsecs. The closest approach occurred with Gaia DR3 6863591389529611264, which passed within 0.3 parsecs, resulting in a negligible velocity change.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Each observation is like opening a window into the Universe’s past,” said team leader Xabier Pérez Couto.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS's discovery adds to the growing interest in tracking interstellar objects. Unlike the recently observed asteroid 2024 ON, which skimmed Earth’s atmosphere, 3I/ATLAS represents a unique class of cosmic traveler that has likely spent billions of years wandering through interstellar space, untouched and unchanged.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue studying 3I/ATLAS to gain further insights into its composition and origin. This research may help scientists understand the early universe and the formation of planetary systems.</p>
