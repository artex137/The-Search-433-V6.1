      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb Decodes Why Exocomet's Anti-Tail Is Still Present As It Approaches Earth</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has explained the unusual presence of an anti-tail on the interstellar exocomet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with its closest flyby set for December 19, 2025. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), has intrigued both scientists and the public, leading to various theories about its origin.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it may provide insight into the comet's composition and behavior, prompting a closer examination by astronomical observatories worldwide. Authorities will monitor 3I/ATLAS closely during its flyby to gather more data and clarify ongoing debates surrounding its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Flyby:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Flyby:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>First Hubble Image:</strong> July 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Second Hubble Image:</strong> November 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Observations:</strong> Rayong, Thailand</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, when it was observed by ATLAS. The comet's unusual features sparked interest among scientists and the public alike. The first image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope was taken on July 21, 2025, revealing the anti-tail phenomenon. A second image was captured on November 30, 2025, as the comet receded from the Sun.</p>

<p>On December 13, 2025, new images were taken by Teerasak Thaluang using a 0.26-meter telescope in Rayong, Thailand, further highlighting the comet's anti-tail. As its closest approach to Earth nears, astronomers are preparing for extensive observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS is therefore not a perspective effect. It is a real physical jet, with a glow extending from 3I/ATLAS towards the Sun,” said Professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There was no mention of this mystery at the NASA press conference about 3I/ATLAS on November 19, 2025,” Loeb criticized.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The presence of an anti-tail in comets is typically a temporary effect, seen when the Earth crosses the comet's orbital plane. However, 3I/ATLAS has displayed this feature consistently, raising questions about its physical properties. Loeb's analysis suggests that this anti-tail may consist of particles that are not behaving as expected under solar radiation pressure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to gather data to understand its characteristics and origins. Further studies and observations are expected during the flyby on December 19, 2025, which may shed light on this mysterious comet.</p>
