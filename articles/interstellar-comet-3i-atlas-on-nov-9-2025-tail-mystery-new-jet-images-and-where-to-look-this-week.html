      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Debate Over Tail and Jet Activity</h2>

<p>On November 9, 2025, new images and reports have reignited discussions regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, particularly about the presence of a tail following its perihelion on October 30, 2025. Observers have noted that images captured on November 5 suggest the comet may appear tail-less, despite its recent close pass by the sun.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges current understandings of comet behavior and may lead to further observations by space agencies. The British Astronomical Association community has shared new analysis showing complex jet structures, prompting calls for targeted follow-up observations using the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
  <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> Closest approach to the sun occurred on October 30, 2025, at approximately 1.4 AU (about 210 million km).</li>
  <li><strong>Closest Earth approach:</strong> Expected on December 19, 2025, at about 270 million km.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> The comet is traveling at roughly 210,000 km/h relative to the sun.</li>
  <li><strong>Viewing conditions:</strong> The comet is visible in the pre-dawn sky starting from November 11, 2025.</li>
  <li><strong>Observation tools:</strong> A small telescope (8-inch/20 cm) or a sensitive imaging setup is recommended for viewing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has followed a notable trajectory since its discovery:</p>
<ul>
  <li>July 1, 2025: 3I/ATLAS discovered during the ATLAS survey.</li>
  <li>October 30, 2025: The comet reaches perihelion, closest to the sun.</li>
  <li>November 5, 2025: Observers capture images suggesting a tail-less appearance.</li>
  <li>November 9, 2025: New images and analysis reveal complex jet structures.</li>
  <li>December 19, 2025: Anticipated closest approach to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There’s no solid evidence the coma has changed color; instead, the gas coma is simply contributing more to the comet’s brightness,” said Qicheng Zhang from Lowell Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar comet, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Both NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth, maintaining a safe distance as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues to climb higher into the morning sky, amateur astronomers and professional researchers are expected to coordinate observations to clarify its tail and jet formations over the coming weeks. Further results from Mars spacecraft campaigns and upcoming observations from ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) are also anticipated.</p>
