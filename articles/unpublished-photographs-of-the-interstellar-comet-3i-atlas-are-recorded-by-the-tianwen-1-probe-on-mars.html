      <h2>Unpublished photographs of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS recorded by Tianwen-1 probe on Mars</h2>

<p>The Administração Espacial Nacional of China (CNSA) has confirmed that the Tianwen-1 probe has captured unpublished photographs of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from its orbit around Mars. The images were taken in October 2026, approximately 30 million kilometers from the comet.</p>

<p>This achievement marks a historic moment for astronomy, showcasing the technological capabilities of the Chinese mission. It opens new avenues for studying celestial bodies that originate outside our Solar System. The successful imaging operation required precise planning and maneuvering to track the fast-moving comet, providing valuable data for the international scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 2026</li>
    <li>Distance from comet: Approximately 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Agency involved: Administração Espacial Nacional of China (CNSA)</li>
    <li>Probe: Tianwen-1</li>
    <li>Significance: First images of an interstellar comet from another planet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2026, the Tianwen-1 probe successfully captured photographs of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The operation involved high-precision maneuvers to ensure the probe's camera could track the comet effectively.</p>
<p>The imaging was part of a broader effort involving multiple space agencies, which directed their instruments to Mars to gain additional insights into the comet during its passage through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Capturing the images represents a significant advance in planetary science, as it allows the analysis of an object coming from another star system from a completely new observation point,” said a CNSA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, interstellar comets have been studied primarily from Earth or space-based telescopes. The ability to capture images from Mars provides a unique perspective and enhances our understanding of these celestial objects.</p>
<p>The collaboration among global space agencies during this event highlights the growing interest in interstellar objects and the importance of international cooperation in astronomical research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the data collected by the Tianwen-1 probe is expected to continue, with scientists aiming to unravel the composition and dynamics of 3I/ATLAS. This research will contribute to a deeper understanding of comets traveling across the galaxy.</p>
