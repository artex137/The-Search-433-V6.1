      <h2>NASA to Release Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS After Government Shutdown</h2>

<p>NASA has announced plans to release high-resolution images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS within days, following a prolonged delay due to a government shutdown that ended on Wednesday. The comet, first observed in July 2025, is only the third interstellar object detected passing through our solar system.</p>

<p>The release of these images, taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera from October 1 to October 7, is significant for scientists eager to study the comet's characteristics. The images are expected to be the clearest yet, surpassing previous photographs captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The images were taken from October 1 to October 7, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA plans to release the images as early as next week.</li>
    <li>The comet will be monitored by NASA’s Juno probe and the European Space Agency’s JUICE spacecraft.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to exit the solar system in March 2024.</li>
    <li>A radio signal detected from 3I/ATLAS confirms it is a natural comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025. In October 2023, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of the comet as it passed near Mars. Following the government shutdown, NASA delayed the release of these images. The shutdown ended on Wednesday, paving the way for the imminent release of the new images.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the comet emerged intact after a close encounter with the Sun, dispelling concerns that it had broken apart. Astronomers also detected the first-ever radio signal from 3I/ATLAS, confirming its status as a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Science should have been prioritized over bureaucracy,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who criticized the delay in releasing the images. “The truth about the nature of 3I/ATLAS will be revealed by the sharing of data, not by the storyline of gatekeepers.”</blockquote>

<p>Loeb emphasized the importance of the upcoming images, stating, “The HiRISE image would give us a side-view as well as a spatial resolution that is three times better than that of the Hubble Space Telescope.”</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has sparked curiosity and speculation, with some theorizing it could be an artificial object. However, the recent detection of a radio signal and observations of jets of water shooting from the comet have led scientists to conclude that it is a natural comet, likely formed billions of years ago in a distant star system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is set to release the images of 3I/ATLAS next week. The comet will continue to be monitored by Juno and JUICE as it travels towards Jupiter, with plans to study its characteristics until it exits our solar system in March 2024.</p>
