      <h2>Harvard professor says '12 anomalies' about 'spaceship' 3I/ATLAS prove alien theory</h2>

<p>A Harvard professor has identified "12 anomalies" about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which he claims support an "alien theory." Professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the object, often referred to as a "spaceship," will make its closest approach to Earth next month. While some scientists categorize 3I/ATLAS as a comet moving at 209,000 kilometres per hour, Loeb argues it could be an alien "mothership."</p>

<p>This assertion has sparked interest among scientists and the public alike, prompting discussions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. As the object approaches, NASA and other space agencies are monitoring its trajectory and characteristics closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is set to approach Earth in November 2023.</li>
    <li>The object travels at approximately 209,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Loeb outlined his findings in a blog post, detailing 12 anomalies.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a nucleus approximately one million times larger than 1I/Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>The object's gas plume contains only 4% water by mass.</li>
    <li>Loeb suggests the object displays non-gravitational acceleration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed as it entered the Solar System. Since its discovery, scientists have attempted to classify it as a comet. However, as it nears Earth, Professor Loeb has published his analysis, raising questions about its true nature.</p>
<p>Loeb has highlighted that 3I/ATLAS's trajectory aligns closely with the ecliptic plane of planets. He also noted its unusual gas plume composition and acceleration characteristics, which differ from typical comet behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The truth is that the mainstream of science is routinely wrong," said Professor Avi Loeb. "It makes most sense to hedge our bets and invest billions of dollars in the simultaneous search for both technological and primitive lifeforms."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around 3I/ATLAS follows the earlier discovery of 1I/Oumuamua, the first recorded interstellar object. Previous analyses of such objects have primarily classified them as comets or asteroids, but 3I/ATLAS's unique characteristics have prompted new theories about extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Loeb's claims challenge established scientific views, echoing ongoing debates about the search for life beyond Earth and the interpretation of anomalous celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor its trajectory and behaviour. Further analysis of the object's composition and characteristics may yield insights into its origins and the validity of Loeb's theories.</p>
