      <h2>3I/ATLAS: ESA Mars Probe Reveals Closest-Ever Images of 'Alien' Object</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has captured unprecedented images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) while orbiting Mars. This milestone was achieved between October 1 and October 7, 2025, marking the first time a spacecraft has observed an interstellar object from another planet.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025, has captivated the global scientific community. It is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet's unique characteristics and high velocity have made it a priority for research, allowing scientists to gain insights into materials from a foreign star system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach by TGO occurred on October 3, 2025, at a distance of 29 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Comet's speed estimated at 246,000 kilometres per hour at perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Next observation planned by ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) for February 2026.</li>
    <li>Closest passage to Earth expected on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 270 million kilometres).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, the comet was primarily tracked by ground-based telescopes. ESA's TGO, which has been in orbit since 2016, redirected its instruments towards the comet between October 1 and October 7, 2025. The closest approach occurred on October 3, 2025. The TGO successfully captured images that improved the positional accuracy of the comet's trajectory significantly. This data was submitted and accepted by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center.</p>

<p>The comet is projected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, and is anticipated to pass Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The ability to use an orbiting spacecraft for triangulation drastically reduced the uncertainty regarding the object's location and trajectory," said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This operation served as a valuable exercise in planetary defence,” the spokesperson added, noting that the agency demonstrated its capability to track high-speed space objects.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its high speed and size, distinguishing it from previous interstellar objects. The comet's nucleus is estimated to be between 0.44 and 5.6 kilometres in diameter, based on Hubble observations. While it poses no threat to Earth, its close approach offers a significant opportunity for scientific study.</p>

<p>This event follows the discoveries of 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, contributing to our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA plans to continue tracking 3I/ATLAS with JUICE as the comet approaches Jupiter in March 2026. Scientists are preparing for the December 19, 2025, close approach to Earth, where they hope to gather detailed observations of the comet.</p>
