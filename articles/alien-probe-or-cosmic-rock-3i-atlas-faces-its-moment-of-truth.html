      <h2>Alien probe or cosmic rock? 3I/ATLAS faces its moment of truth</h2>

<p>As the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists are preparing for a key event on October 29, 2025, when it will reach its closest point to the Sun at approximately 203 million kilometers. This perihelion phase may provide critical insights into whether 3I/ATLAS is a typical comet or something more complex. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this astronomical event.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to challenge our understanding of cosmic objects. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has raised questions about whether the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS was intentionally designed, possibly by extraterrestrial intelligence. In a white paper co-authored with researchers Omer Eldadi and Gershon Tenenbaum, Loeb urges policymakers to consider the risks posed by unusually massive interstellar bodies. With perihelion occurring just two days before Halloween, it adds an element of intrigue to the scientific inquiry.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date of perihelion: October 29, 2025</li>
<li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: 203 million kilometers</li>
<li>Closest approach to Venus: November 3, 2025, at 97 million kilometers</li>
<li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 267 million kilometers</li>
<li>Distance from Jupiter at next major milestone: March 16, 2026, at 54 million kilometers</li>
<li>Organizations involved: Harvard University, European Space Agency (ESA), NASA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is currently on a trajectory that will bring it near the Sun, with perihelion set for October 29, 2025. Following this, it will pass Venus on November 3, 2025. The object will then approach Earth on December 19, 2025. The next significant event will occur on March 16, 2026, when it draws closer to Jupiter.</p>

<p>During the perihelion phase, astronomers will closely monitor 3I/ATLAS for signs of unusual activity, which may suggest artificial behavior. NASA’s Juno spacecraft is expected to observe the object when it nears Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Perihelion represents the acid test: if the object is a natural comet, solar heating might cause it to fragment and produce a bright plume of gas and dust."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also remarked, "If it were an engineered object, its behavior could be very different. It might maneuver unexpectedly, or generate excess heat or light inconsistent with natural composition."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The investigation into 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader scientific effort to understand interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial technologies. The high ratio of nickel to iron in 3I/ATLAS distinguishes it from typical comets, raising further questions about its nature.</p>

<p>Loeb has emphasized the importance of maintaining an open mind regarding the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth, coining the term "cosmic modesty" to describe this perspective.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the date of perihelion approaches, astronomers will continue to analyze atmospheric data from observatories to detect any anomalies. Following the close encounters with Venus and Earth, scientists will prepare for the observations by NASA’s Juno spacecraft in March 2026.</p>
