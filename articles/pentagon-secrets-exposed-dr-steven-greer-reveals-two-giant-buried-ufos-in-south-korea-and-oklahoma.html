      <h2>Pentagon Secrets Exposed: Dr Steven Greer Reveals Two Giant Buried UFOs in South Korea and Oklahoma</h2>

<p>UFO researcher Dr Steven Greer has claimed that two massive alien crafts have been recovered and buried in South Korea and Oklahoma. The first craft is reportedly located in the mountains outside Seoul, while the second is beneath a military installation near Fort Sill, Oklahoma. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these claims.</p>

<p>This revelation could significantly alter public understanding of extraterrestrial technology and government secrecy. Authorities have not disclosed further information about investigations or actions taken in response to these claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First craft located outside Seoul, South Korea, reportedly hundreds of feet long.</li>
    <li>Second craft buried beneath a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.</li>
    <li>South Korean whistleblower has eight years of senior investigative experience across eighteen black projects.</li>
    <li>Dr Greer has suggested additional recovered UFOs exist in undisclosed locations.</li>
    <li>Claims raise questions about government transparency regarding extraterrestrial technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Dr Steven Greer has made claims about the existence of two buried UFOs, alleging that one craft lies concealed in the mountains near Seoul and the other under a SCIF at Fort Sill. He cites a whistleblower with extensive investigative experience who provided information about the recovery of these crafts. Greer has suggested that these crafts are too large to move, necessitating their concealment on-site.</p>
<p>The claims have sparked a mix of excitement and skepticism on social media, with users demanding evidence and verification. Critics have accused Greer of exaggeration but also acknowledge that some of his previous disclosures have been validated.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The size of some alien craft makes them almost impossible to transport, which is why these installations were constructed on-site,” Dr Greer stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These installations are a method of keeping large alien technology secure while still allowing investigative and military personnel to study the craft,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Dr Greer's claims come amid ongoing discussions about government transparency in relation to UFOs and extraterrestrial life. In the past, he has assembled military witnesses and advocated for greater disclosure of UFO-related information. His previous disclosures have faced skepticism but have also gained some validation from mainstream sources.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not indicated any immediate plans for investigation or disclosure regarding Dr Greer's claims. The public response may influence future discussions on extraterrestrial technology and government secrecy.</p>
