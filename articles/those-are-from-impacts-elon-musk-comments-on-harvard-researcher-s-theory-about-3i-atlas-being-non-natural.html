      <h2>Elon Musk comments on Harvard researcher’s theory about comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Elon Musk has addressed a theory proposed by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may be a non-natural object. During an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk stated that the characteristics of the comet do not imply an artificial origin.</p>

<p>This discussion is significant as it highlights ongoing debates in the scientific community about the origins of celestial objects. Authorities, including NASA, have confirmed that Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, with its closest approach expected to occur in 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first reported on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Pre-discovery observations date back to June 14, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth is projected at about 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 170 million miles or 270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Expected perihelion is on October 30, 2025, at roughly 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The estimated nucleus size of 3I/ATLAS is between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Nasa has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2025, pre-discovery observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS began. The comet was officially reported on July 1, 2025. During a recent interview on The Joe Rogan Experience, Elon Musk responded to Avi Loeb's theory regarding the comet's composition and potential artificial origins.</p>
<p>Musk emphasized that nickel found in the comet is a product of natural processes, specifically impacts from asteroids and comets. He clarified that such materials can occur naturally and do not indicate artificial construction.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Those are from impacts - you definitely didn't want to be there at the time because anything would have been obliterated,” Musk said during the interview.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There are definitely comets and asteroids that are made primarily of nickel,” he added, highlighting the natural origins of nickel-rich deposits.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has proposed that 3I/ATLAS could be a probe sent by extraterrestrial life. He noted that its composition is mostly nickel with very little iron, which he argues suggests industrial origins. Musk, however, maintains that current evidence points to a natural origin for the comet's nickel-rich content.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue as it follows its hyperbolic trajectory toward perihelion in 2025. NASA and other agencies will monitor the comet's progress and composition closely.</p>
