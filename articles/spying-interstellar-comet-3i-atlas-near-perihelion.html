      <h2>Spying Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Near Perihelion</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has approached perihelion this week, reaching its closest point to the Sun on Wednesday, October 29, 2023, at approximately 11:47 Universal Time (UT). The comet, discovered on July 2, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), is currently about 1.36 Astronomical Units (AU) from the Sun.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the scientific interest surrounding 3I/ATLAS, as it is only the third interstellar comet observed entering the inner solar system. Despite ongoing government shutdowns affecting U.S. space agencies, amateur astronomers have taken up the task of tracking the comet, which exhibits characteristics typical of comets, including a coma and a dust tail. NASA has stated it is not hiding any information about the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 29, 2023, at 11:47 UT.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently 1.36 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It is moving at a speed of 58 kilometers per second relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will become visible from Earth in November.</li>
    <li>The comet passed 0.19 AU from Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 2, 2023, during the ATLAS sky survey. Initial observations noted its high orbital eccentricity, indicating it originated from outside the solar system. The comet passed close to Mars on October 3, 2023. As it approached perihelion, amateur astronomers have actively monitored its progress due to the silence from NASA amid the government shutdown.</p>

<p>As of October 29, 2023, the comet reached perihelion and is expected to become visible from Earth in November, appearing low in the dawn sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Initial detections of the comet showed that it had a condensed coma, with an offset pointing towards the Sun,” said Bryce Bolin, Research Scientist at Eureka Scientific. “However, starting in August-early September, the comet started to evolve an extended anti-solar tail.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The comet appears to have started to turn green due to cometary gases,” Bolin added. “This is due to the emission of diatomic carbon, which gives comets their green color.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third interstellar comet observed, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. It was discovered while still 4.5 AU from the Sun, unlike 1I/Oumuamua, which was only observed on its exit from the solar system. The increased capability of sky-scanning telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin telescope expected to come online in 2025, will aid in future observations of such interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After perihelion, 3I/ATLAS will become visible from Earth in November, providing opportunities for observation with backyard telescopes. The comet is projected to exit the solar system in 2026, moving toward the constellation Gemini.</p>
