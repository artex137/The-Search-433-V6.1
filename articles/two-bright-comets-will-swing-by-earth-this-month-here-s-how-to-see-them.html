      <h2>Two newly discovered comets to pass by Earth this month</h2>
<p>Comets C/2025 A6 Lemmon and C/2025 R2 SWAN are making their closest approaches to Earth on October 21 and October 20, respectively, offering a rare opportunity for sky-gazers to view them.</p>

<p>Both comets, which are composed of ice, frozen gases, and rock, have been detected recently. Researchers emphasize their unique significance, as they provide insights into the early solar system. Observers are encouraged to use binoculars or telescopes during their limited visibility periods.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet SWAN will approach Earth on October 20, coming within <strong>24 million miles</strong> (38.6 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Comet Lemmon will pass on October 21, at a distance of <strong>55 million miles</strong> (88.5 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>SWAN was first detected on September 10, 2023; Lemmon was spotted on January 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>SWAN is expected to fade quickly, while Lemmon may brighten over the coming weeks.</li>
    <li>Both comets are visible in the Northern Hemisphere, though SWAN is primarily observable in the Southern Hemisphere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 3, 2025, researchers at Mount Lemmon Observatory in Arizona discovered Comet C/2025 A6 Lemmon. This discovery was part of the Catalina Sky Survey, aimed at detecting near-Earth objects.</p>
<p>On September 10, 2023, Ukrainian amateur astronomer Vladimir Bezugly detected Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN using images from the Solar Wind ANisotropies instrument aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft.</p>
<p>Both comets have since been studied to understand their composition and behavior as they approach the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This one is spectacular because it may be able to be seen from a dark location with only a regular set of binoculars or even the naked eye at its brightest,” said Carson Fuls, director of the Catalina Sky Survey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When one gets nudged back toward the sun, we’re seeing materials that have barely changed since the solar system’s beginning,” said Carrie Holt, postdoctoral fellow at Las Cumbres Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets like Lemmon and SWAN are classified as long-period comets, with orbits lasting over 200 years. These comets originate from the Oort Cloud, a distant region of icy bodies surrounding our solar system. Their study helps scientists learn about the formation of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Sky-gazers are advised to observe the comets in the coming weeks, particularly during their closest approaches. After November, Lemmon will become visible only in the Southern Hemisphere, while SWAN will not reappear for another 650 to 700 years.</p>
