      <h2>Elon Musk warns of potential threat from comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has issued a warning about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, claiming it could pose a significant threat to human life. Musk made his comments during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast on November 17, 2025.</p>

<p>This warning comes as scientists continue to study 3I/ATLAS, which is currently on a trajectory through our solar system. Experts have expressed uncertainty about the object's origin and composition, with some suggesting it may not be a naturally formed object. Authorities are monitoring its approach, particularly as it is expected to make its closest pass to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>First detected:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Notable experts:</strong> Elon Musk, Avi Loeb, Brian Cox</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by astronomers in July 2025. Since then, experts have debated its nature, with some suggesting it could be an artificial object. On November 17, 2025, Musk expressed his concerns regarding the object during a podcast, stating it could potentially "kill most of human life" if it were to collide with Earth.</p>

<p>Musk's comments followed a series of observations and analyses by scientists, including Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who has suggested there is a possibility the object is not naturally formed. The object is expected to be visible again in early December 2025 as it moves around the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If it goes off course from its plotted Earth fly-by, it could pose a huge collision risk.” 
    <strong>— Elon Musk</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It is entirely natural in origin... Isn’t that wonderful enough?” 
    <strong>— Brian Cox</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Scientists have noted unusual features about this object, including non-gravitational accelerations and the detection of a radio signal that sparked further interest.</p>

<p>Debate continues among experts regarding the object's composition, with some, like Professor Brian Cox, asserting that it is a natural comet made of carbon dioxide and water ices.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are preparing for renewed observations of 3I/ATLAS in early December 2025. They will continue to monitor its trajectory closely as it approaches Earth, assessing any potential risks associated with its fly-by.</p>
