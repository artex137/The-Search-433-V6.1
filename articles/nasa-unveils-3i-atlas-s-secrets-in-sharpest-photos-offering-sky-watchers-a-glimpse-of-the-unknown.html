      <h2>NASA Unveils 3I/ATLAS's Secrets in Sharpest Photos, Offering Sky-Watchers a Glimpse of the Unknown</h2>

<p>NASA has prepared to unveil sharp images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which passed near Mars between 1 October and 7 October 2023. The release of these images, captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera, had been delayed due to the recent US government shutdown. The new images aim to provide concrete data about the object, moving discussions from speculation to evidence.</p>

<p>The upcoming images are significant for astronomers, as they will be the highest-resolution views of 3I/ATLAS to date, surpassing those taken by the Hubble Space Telescope on 21 July 2023. Researchers expect these images will allow them to better understand the object's core and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed Mars from 1 October to 7 October 2023.</li>
    <li>Images were captured by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>The release of the images has been delayed due to a US government shutdown.</li>
    <li>The new images are expected to have a spatial resolution three times better than Hubble's.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently heading towards Jupiter.</li>
    <li>The object has remained intact despite close encounters with the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS passed Mars between 1 October and 7 October 2023. NASA captured images of the object during this time using the HiRISE camera. The release of these images was delayed due to the US government shutdown, which affected various scientific operations. Astronomers have expressed anticipation for the upcoming release, as it may provide critical insights into the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<blockquote>“Science should have been prioritised over bureaucracy,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. “The truth about the nature of 3I/ATLAS will be revealed by the sharing of data, not by the storyline of gatekeepers.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has sparked considerable debate among scientists due to its unusual behaviour, including a distinctive 'anti-tail' that points towards the Sun. This feature has led to discussions about whether the object could be more than just a typical comet. Avi Loeb has previously suggested that the object might have an artificial origin, which has fueled speculation and interest in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey towards Jupiter, NASA's Juno spacecraft and ESA's JUICE mission will monitor its progress. The release of the HiRISE images is expected to occur as early as next week, providing crucial data for ongoing studies of this interstellar visitor.</p>
