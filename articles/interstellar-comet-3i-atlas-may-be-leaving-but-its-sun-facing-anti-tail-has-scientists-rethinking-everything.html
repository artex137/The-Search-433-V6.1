      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS May Be Leaving — but Its Sun-Facing Anti-Tail Has Scientists Rethinking Everything</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is currently leaving our solar system, but its unusual anti-tail is prompting scientists to reassess their understanding of cosmic objects. The comet is receding from view as it moves away from the Sun, and astronomers are studying its unexpected features.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing models of comet behaviour. Researchers are now investigating the comet's anti-tail, which exhibits a rhythmic wobble, to gain insights into the conditions under which it formed and how it behaves when interacting with solar forces.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in June 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached its closest point to Earth on 19 December 2025, approximately 270 million km (168 million miles) away.</li>
    <li>The anti-tail is estimated to stretch up to 620,000 miles (1 million km).</li>
    <li>The wobbling jets of the anti-tail shift every 7 hours and 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of the comet completes one full rotation approximately every 15 hours and 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in June 2025. Its closest approach to Earth occurred on 19 December 2025, sparking significant interest from astronomers. As it neared the Sun, the comet's anti-tail and jet-like features were observed, revealing a unique wobbling behaviour not previously documented in interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The wobbling jets and uncommon anti-tail challenge scientists to refine their understanding of comet behaviour,” a researcher noted, highlighting the importance of this discovery for future studies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>While anti-tails and jet activity have been observed in comets within our solar system, 3I/ATLAS represents the first documented case of such behaviour in an interstellar object. This offers researchers a rare opportunity to test existing models of comet physics and gain insights into the formation of cosmic bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues to fade into space, scientists will analyze the data collected during its passage. Researchers hope to uncover further insights that may enhance understanding of comet formation and behaviour across the galaxy.</p>
