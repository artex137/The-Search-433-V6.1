      <h2>UFO Allegedly Took Control Of Soviet Nukes Aimed At America</h2>

<p>During a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on Tuesday, investigative journalist George Knapp testified that a UFO allegedly took control of Soviet nuclear weapons aimed at the United States in 1982. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this claim.</p>

<p>This testimony raises significant concerns about national security and the potential implications of unidentified aerial phenomena. The House Oversight subcommittee has been investigating UFO sightings and their impact on military operations, as well as public safety.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing held on Tuesday, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Testimony by George Knapp regarding events in October 1982.</li>
    <li>Incident involved an ICBM base with missiles aimed at the U.S.</li>
    <li>UFOs reportedly performed complex maneuvers and entered launch codes.</li>
    <li>Similar incidents reported in 1967 at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 1982, a series of UFO sightings occurred over a Soviet ICBM base. According to Knapp's testimony, these UFOs displayed remarkable agility and capabilities. After a four-hour period, the launch control codes for the ICBMs allegedly activated, indicating a loss of control by Soviet personnel.</p>

<p>Knapp stated that Russian officers experienced panic as the missiles were prepared for launch without their authorization. Following the incident, the UFOs reportedly vanished, and the launch control system returned to normal.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There was an incident in October of 1982 over an ICBM base where UFOs popped up... right at the end of this four-hour period, the launch control codes for the ICBMs lit up.”</blockquote> 
<blockquote>“The missiles were fired up and ready to launch, and they could not shut it down.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This claim is not isolated. In 1967, an unidentified object allegedly deactivated ten nuclear weapons at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The U.S. military has documented multiple instances of unidentified objects interacting with nuclear facilities, raising questions about the security of nuclear arsenals.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The House Oversight subcommittee is expected to continue its investigation into UFO sightings and their implications for national security. Further hearings and testimonies may be scheduled to explore these claims in greater detail.</p>
