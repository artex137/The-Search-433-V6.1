      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Displays Multiple Jets Following Close Passage to Sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, has exhibited multiple jets as it passed closest to the sun on October 29, 2025. The closest approach occurred at 11:47 UTC (6:47 a.m. CDT), when the comet was approximately 1.36 AU (about 126 million miles or 203 million km) from the sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides scientists with an opportunity to study the behavior of interstellar comets during close solar encounters. Observations have already begun, with astrophotographers capturing images of the comet, which is expected to produce more visual data in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the sun:</strong> October 29, 2025, at 11:47 UTC (6:47 a.m. CDT)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the sun:</strong> 1.36 AU (126 million miles or 203 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Next closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (168 million miles or 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Requires at least an 8-inch (20 cm) telescope; not visible to the naked eye</li>
    <li><strong>Observing spacecraft:</strong> ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE)</li>
    <li><strong>Previous close approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025, at 4 UTC</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars at 4 UTC (11 p.m. CDT on October 2), approximately 18 million miles (29 million kilometers) away from the planet. During this period, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express captured images of the comet. TGO successfully imaged the comet, describing it as “a slightly fuzzy white dot” against the starry background.</p>

<p>Following this, on October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest distance to the sun, resulting in the observation of jets streaming from the comet. Images from this event have been shared by astrophotographers, showcasing the changes in the comet's appearance.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object now displays multiple jets, streaming out in all directions,” said an unnamed source involved in the observations of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. Its trajectory suggests it originated from the thin disk of the Milky Way. Previous studies have attempted to trace its path back to its source, but no specific star has been identified as its origin.</p>

<p>In addition to 3I/ATLAS, other comets, such as Comet Lemmon and Comet SWAN, are currently visible in the night sky, providing additional opportunities for observation and study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, researchers anticipate further observations, particularly from the JUICE spacecraft, which is expected to provide data by February 2026. The comet will remain under close observation as it approaches Earth in December.</p>
