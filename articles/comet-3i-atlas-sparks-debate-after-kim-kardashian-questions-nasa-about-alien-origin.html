      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS sparks debate after Kim Kardashian questions NASA about alien origin</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has generated public curiosity after Kim Kardashian questioned NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, about its potential alien origin on October 30, 2025. Duffy responded that there are no aliens or threats to Earth related to the comet.</p>

<p>The comet, detected in July 2025 by the University of Hawaii's ATLAS system, is the third known object to originate outside the solar system. Its upcoming approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles has intensified interest among scientists and the public alike.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Alert System.</li>
  <li>Size estimated up to 5.6 kilometers wide.</li>
  <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred last month.</li>
  <li>Comet will pass within 170 million miles of Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
  <li>Composition includes water, dust, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide.</li>
  <li>Observations indicate high carbon dioxide and nickel content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the University of Hawaii's ATLAS system detected comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet's hyperbolic orbit confirmed its interstellar origin. The closest passage to the Sun occurred in October 2025, where intense brightness was observed. On October 30, Kim Kardashian questioned NASA about the comet's potential alien origin, prompting a response from Sean Duffy.</p>

<p>Since its detection, astronomers have used various telescopes to study the comet's composition and trajectory. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope revealed unique characteristics that differ from typical comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There are no aliens or threats to Earth,” said Sean Duffy, responding to Kardashian's inquiry.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated that the comet could potentially mask alien technology, comparing it to reconnaissance probes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>David Jewitt remarked that all observed features align with natural comets from the solar system.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding comet 3I/ATLAS reflects broader public interest in space exploration and potential extraterrestrial life. Previous incidents have seen similar speculation about unidentified celestial objects. Experts emphasize the importance of distinguishing between possibility and probability in discussions about alien life.</p>

<p>Additionally, the involvement of public figures like Kardashian has highlighted the role of celebrity in scientific communication, potentially expanding interest in NASA's planetary defense initiatives.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations by the James Webb and Hubble Telescopes are scheduled to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS in the coming weeks. This data will refine understanding of the comet's composition and trajectory, aiding in scientific analysis during its December passage.</p>
