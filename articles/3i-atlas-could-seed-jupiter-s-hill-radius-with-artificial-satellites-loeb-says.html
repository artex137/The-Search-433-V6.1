      <h2>3I/ATLAS Could Seed Jupiter's Hill Radius with 'Artificial Satellites', Loeb Says</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, is set to pass near Jupiter's Hill radius on March 16, 2026, according to Harvard scientist Avi Loeb. This close approach, at a distance of 53.445 million kilometres from Jupiter, has raised questions about the potential for the comet to release objects that could be captured by the planet's gravity.</p>

<p>This event matters because it could provide insights into the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory. Current research suggests that if the comet's perijove coincides with Jupiter's Hill radius, it could indicate the presence of "technological devices" released as artificial satellites. This possibility has garnered attention from scientists and space agencies monitoring the comet's approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Distance at perijove: 53.445 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Jupiter's expected Hill radius: 53.502 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Likelihood of coincidence: smaller than 0.00004</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been traveling through the solar system since its discovery. As it nears its perijove, scientists have begun to analyse the implications of its trajectory:</p>
<ul>
    <li>March 16, 2026: 3I/ATLAS will pass 53.445 million kilometres from Jupiter.</li>
    <li>Upcoming months: Spacecraft Juno, Juice, and Psyche will gather more data on the comet and Jupiter's Hill radius.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If at perijove, the rare coincidence between the perijove distance of 3I/ATLAS and the Hill radius materialises, then it could be a sign of technological signature,” said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The rare coincidence will constitute the most remarkable anomaly of 3I/ATLAS,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, initially perceived as a comet, has sparked debate about its origins and nature. Its trajectory through the solar system has led to speculation about potential technological signatures. Previous studies of other celestial bodies have also raised questions about their interactions with larger cosmic objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming months, researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS's approach and gather data from various spacecraft to clarify the relationship between its perijove distance and Jupiter's Hill radius.</p>
