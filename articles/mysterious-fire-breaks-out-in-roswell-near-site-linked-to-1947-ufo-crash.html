      <h2>Mysterious fire breaks out in Roswell near site linked to 1947 UFO crash</h2>

<p>A large fire has broken out at the Roswell Air Center late Thursday, just a few miles from Hangar 84, a site associated with the infamous UFO crash of 1947. Firefighters responded to reports of flames at approximately 19:55 p.m. local time on East Earl Cummings Loop. Authorities have reported no injuries and have not confirmed whether any historically significant objects were affected.</p>

<p>The fire has drawn attention due to its proximity to Hangar 84, which has long been a focal point for UFO enthusiasts. Authorities have expanded the security perimeter and evacuated nearby buildings due to concerns about hazardous materials and oxygen cylinders stored in the vicinity. Firefighters declared the fire under control around 21:45 p.m. on Thursday. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p>
