      <h2>US Congressman Claims Crashed UFO is So Big 'They've Built an Entire Building Around It'</h2>

<p>A US congressman has claimed that a country possesses a UFO so large it has required the construction of an "entire building around it." Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison made the statement during an interview with Rob Finnerty on Newsmax, discussing the alleged crashed alien craft located outside of the US.</p>

<p>This assertion has sparked renewed interest in government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Burlison expressed frustration over his inability to access facilities for personal investigation, citing challenges in obtaining permission for international inquiries. He emphasized his commitment to informing the public if he acquires definitive evidence regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Congressman Eric Burlison claims a UFO is located outside the US.</li>
    <li>He stated the craft is so large that a building has been constructed around it.</li>
    <li>Burlison has faced challenges accessing investigation sites near Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Dr. Steven Greer, a UFO researcher, provided additional details about the craft.</li>
    <li>The US government’s UAP Disclosure Act of 2023 aims to control UFO sighting information.</li>
    <li>A recent Pentagon report identified over 750 new UAP sightings from May 2023 to June 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During a recent interview, Congressman Eric Burlison discussed reports of a crashed alien craft. He refrained from naming the country involved, citing the need to protect classified information. Dr. Steven Greer, who joined Burlison, claimed he had knowledge of a UFO in South Korea and another near Fort Sill, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>In the wake of these claims, former President Barack Obama made comments about the existence of aliens, stating they are real but not being kept at Area 51. Additionally, the US government's UAP Disclosure Act of 2023 has been introduced to manage information related to UFO sightings, citing national security concerns.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If I come under any hard evidence, whether it's physical or video evidence that is absolutely definitive... I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe.” 
    <strong>- Congressman Eric Burlison</strong>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “There is a need to protect America’s nuclear program... credible evidence and testimony indicates that Federal Government unidentified anomalous phenomena records exist that have not been declassified.” 
    <strong>- US government’s UAP Disclosure Act of 2023</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UFOs has surged recently, particularly following public statements from notable figures, including former President Obama. The US government's UAP Disclosure Act of 2023 reflects ongoing concerns about national security and the management of information regarding UFO sightings.</p>

<p>In addition, a Pentagon report indicated that over 750 new UAP sightings had been recorded, highlighting the increasing scrutiny of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congressman Burlison plans to continue seeking access to investigate the alleged crashed UFO while advocating for transparency regarding evidence of extraterrestrial life. The US government is expected to maintain its current policies on UAP information control amid ongoing investigations.</p>
