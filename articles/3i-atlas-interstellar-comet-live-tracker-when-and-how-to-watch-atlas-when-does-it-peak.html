      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet Live Tracker: When and how to watch ATLAS? When does it peak?</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on Wednesday, October 29, at approximately 11:47 Universal Time (UT). The comet will approach to about 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun, just beyond Earth's orbital distance. NASA has reported that the comet will swing just inside Mars’ orbit at its perihelion, which will occur around October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This event matters because 3I/ATLAS is only the third known visitor from beyond the solar system. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates it will not loop back around the Sun, and tracing its trajectory reveals that it originated from deep interstellar space. Scientists anticipate that visibility from Earth will not occur until sometime in November, as the comet will be positioned almost directly opposite Earth on the far side of the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2023, at 11:47 UT</li>
  <li>Distance from the Sun at closest approach: 1.36 astronomical units</li>
  <li>Perihelion date: October 30, 2025</li>
  <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: approximately 1.4 astronomical units (130 million miles or 210 million kilometers)</li>
  <li>Current visibility from Earth: not visible until November 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been identified as an interstellar comet due to its hyperbolic orbit. Its trajectory indicates it has traveled from deep interstellar space. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023, and will not become visible from Earth until November 2023.</p>

<p>As it approaches the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will swing just inside Mars' orbit, marking a significant moment for astronomers and space enthusiasts alike.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is only the third known visitor from beyond the solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Scientists expect it will not become visible from Earth until sometime in November.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows in the footsteps of previous interstellar visitors, including 'Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. Its unique trajectory provides valuable insights into the nature of objects originating from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches its closest point to the Sun, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and prepare for potential visibility in November 2023.</p>
