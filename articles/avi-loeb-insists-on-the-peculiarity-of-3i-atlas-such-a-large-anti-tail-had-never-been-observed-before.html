      <h2>Avi Loeb insists on the peculiarity of 3I/ATLAS: "Such a large anti-tail had never been observed before"</h2>

<p>Harvard professor <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has raised concerns about the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> during a series of discussions over the past few weeks. NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet, but Loeb has expressed skepticism, particularly regarding the object's antitail, which points toward the Sun. He has described the antitail as a "mystery" and noted its unusual size, measuring half a million kilometers.</p>

<p>This debate is significant as it challenges conventional understandings of cometary behavior and raises questions about the object's origins. NASA has maintained that 3I/ATLAS is a comet and poses no threat to Earth, while Loeb suggests the possibility of a technological origin for the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Length of antitail:</strong> 500,000 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Average distance to the Moon:</strong> 384,400 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Speed of material in the antitail:</strong> at least 130 meters per second</li>
    <li><strong>Classification by NASA:</strong> comet</li>
    <li><strong>Potential alternative explanation:</strong> technological thruster</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Over the last few weeks, Avi Loeb has focused on the peculiarities of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its antitail. He first raised concerns about its size and behavior shortly after the object reached perihelion. In his latest observations, he has emphasized that the antitail's length is unprecedented for comets.</p>

<p>Loeb has suggested that the speed of the material in the antitail might indicate a non-gravitational acceleration, leading him to theorize about the possibility of advanced technology being involved. Meanwhile, NASA has consistently reaffirmed its position that 3I/ATLAS is a comet and has dismissed any speculation regarding its origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "To reach a scale of 500,000 kilometers in the last 45 days after perihelion, the speed of the material in the antitail towards the Sun must be at least 130 meters per second with respect to the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "The alternative is a jet from a technological thruster."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nasa has responded, stating, "3I/ATLAS, as interesting as it may be, is a comet" and has reiterated that it poses no danger to Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Avi Loeb has questioned the nature of interstellar objects. His previous claims regarding the potential for extraterrestrial technology have sparked significant debate within the scientific community. The ongoing discourse about 3I/ATLAS reflects broader discussions about the origins and behaviors of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the investigation into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS continues, scientists will further analyze its antitail and the implications of its unusual features. NASA plans to maintain its position on the object while monitoring any new developments.</p>
