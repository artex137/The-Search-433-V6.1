      <h2>Behavior of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS surprises scientists</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has surprised astronomers with a sharp increase in brightness and a change in color. The comet passed its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2023, at a distance of 203 million km. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>The unexpected activity of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it presents an opportunity for scientists to gain insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Currently, although the comet has temporarily disappeared from Earth-based observatories, astronomers are continuing to observe it using spacecraft equipped with coronagraphs, including the SOHO and STEREO-A missions, as well as the GOES-19 satellite.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: 203 million km.</li>
    <li>Significant increase in brightness noted in September–October 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet's brightness increase rate has doubled compared to earlier this year.</li>
    <li>Color change from red to blue observed.</li>
    <li>Research article by astronomers Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams published on arXiv.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September and October 2025, astronomers noted an abnormal surge in brightness from comet 3I/ATLAS. This increase coincided with the comet's perihelion passage on October 29, 2023. Following this event, the comet temporarily became difficult to observe from Earth-based locations.</p>

<p>Despite its disappearance from ground observations, spacecraft such as SOHO and STEREO-A have continued to monitor the comet. Researchers have analyzed images captured by these missions to understand the comet's unusual behavior more thoroughly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The increase in brightness may be caused by a massive release of gas from the comet, which managed to block the reflection of its dust,” said Qicheng Zhang, one of the researchers analyzing the comet's activity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The blue color is characteristic of molecules such as C2 and NH2, which glow intensely when heated by the Sun,” added Karl Battams.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations of 3I/ATLAS have indicated that its dust was red in color, making the recent blue color change particularly surprising. The comet's chemical composition appears to differ from typical comets in our Solar System, containing higher levels of carbon dioxide, more volatile ices, and unusual metals.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists expect to gain more insights into the behavior of 3I/ATLAS in November when it reappears in the Earth’s sky. Given the comet's sharp increase in brightness, it may become visible to amateur astronomers using standard telescopes.</p>
