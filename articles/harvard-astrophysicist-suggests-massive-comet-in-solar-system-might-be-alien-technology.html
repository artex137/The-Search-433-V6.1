      <h2>Harvard Astrophysicist Suggests Massive Comet in Solar System Might Be Alien Technology</h2>

<p>A recently discovered comet, 3I/ATLAS, traveling through the solar system, has sparked intrigue among scientists, with Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggesting it may be an artifact of alien technology. The comet, which weighs over 33 billion tons and measures at least 3.1 miles across, is only the third interstellar object known to visit our solar system, following Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it prompts further investigation into the comet's origins and potential technological implications. Authorities, including NASA, are considering enhanced monitoring and observation strategies to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars, Jupiter, and Venus.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS weighs over <strong>33 billion tons</strong>.</li>
    <li>It stretches at least <strong>3.1 miles</strong> across.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass within <strong>1.67 million miles</strong> of Mars' orbit next week.</li>
    <li>Observations show the comet is shedding large volumes of carbon dioxide and dust.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has called for NASA to use the HiRISE camera for detailed imaging of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered recently, with initial observations suggesting it was a typical interstellar comet. However, further analysis revealed its significant size and mass, leading Loeb to propose it might be of alien origin.</p>

<p>In July, detections indicated that the comet was shedding carbon dioxide and dust, which contributed to a revised understanding of its trajectory and composition.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to approach Mars in the coming week, providing a critical opportunity for scientific observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "We should not judge 3I/ATLAS merely based on surface compositions, similar to the advice not to judge a book by its cover."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing interest in interstellar objects, following the previous sightings of Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These encounters have sparked debates about the nature of such objects and their origins.</p>

<p>Loeb's theory about the comet being an alien probe is part of ongoing discussions in the astronomical community regarding the implications of discovering extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is considering the use of the HiRISE camera on its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for detailed imaging of 3I/ATLAS. The scientific community will continue to monitor the comet as it travels through the solar system.</p>
