      <h2>New Radio Silence and Size Estimate Sharpen the Mystery of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A new analysis of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has revealed significant findings regarding its radio emissions and physical size, according to research published in recent peer-reviewed studies. The research team conducted radio observations on July 2, 2025, using the Allen Telescope Array, and has since narrowed the possibilities surrounding the object's characteristics.</p>

<p>The findings are important as they challenge existing theories about 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited unusual behavior compared to typical comets. Scientists are now focusing on understanding the object's dynamics and its potential origins. This analysis may help refine the understanding of cometary physics and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observations conducted on July 2, 2025, using the Allen Telescope Array.</li>
    <li>Initial detection of nearly 74 million signal hits reduced to 211 credible candidates.</li>
    <li>Upper bound on radio transmission estimated at approximately 10 to 110 watts.</li>
    <li>Independent observations on December 19, 2025, constrained emissions to roughly a tenth of a watt.</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size of 3I/ATLAS is approximately one kilometer in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 2, 2025, researchers collected 7.25 hours of radio data from 3I/ATLAS. They initially identified millions of signal hits, which were filtered down to just over 200 credible signals. In December 2025, additional observations further refined the understanding of possible emissions. These findings confirmed the size estimate of the object, placing it within the range of large comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The current models assume gas outflow at thermal speeds, but prior work suggests that the dominant momentum transfer could instead come from the ejection of icy fragments,” said a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been a subject of interest since its discovery due to its unique characteristics, which differ from typical cometary behavior. The object has shown anomalous non-gravitational acceleration and persistent sunward jets, prompting scientists to explore various hypotheses regarding its origins and physical properties.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS for new data, particularly looking for direct measurements of jet composition and velocity. These observations will be crucial in determining whether the object conforms to existing models of cometary physics or if new models will need to be developed.</p>
