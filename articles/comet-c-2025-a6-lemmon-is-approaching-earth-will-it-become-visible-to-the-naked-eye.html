      <p class="byline">Published 2025-09-08 20:23 UTC</p>

      <h2>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) is on a trajectory to come closest to Earth on October 20, 2025, at a distance of 55.41 million miles (89.16 million km). Astronomers hope it may become visible to the naked eye under optimal viewing conditions.</p>

<p>The Mount Lemmon Survey has been monitoring the comet, which is expected to brighten as it approaches the sun. Authorities encourage skywatchers to prepare for potential sightings, particularly in areas with minimal light pollution.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: October 20, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 55.41 million miles (89.16 million km)</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest point to the sun): November 8, 2025, at 49.25 million miles (79.25 million km)</li>
    <li>Orbital period: Approximately 1,350 years</li>
    <li>Initial discovery: January 3, 2025, by David Fuls</li>
    <li>Expected brightness: Between magnitude +4 and +7.3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) was first detected on January 3, 2025, by astronomer David Fuls, initially misidentified as an asteroid due to its faintness.</p>
<p>Follow-up observations confirmed it as a comet, with additional pre-discovery images found dating back to November 2024. Calculations by Syuichi Nakano of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams have established its orbit.</p>
<p>The comet will pass within 216.6 million miles (348.5 million km) of Jupiter on April 16, 2025, which will affect its orbital path.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Mount Lemmon Survey continues to provide valuable data on near-Earth objects, including comets,” said a representative of the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon has a long orbital history, returning approximately every 1,350 years. It falls into the category of common comets, which are typically only visible through telescopes or binoculars.</p>
<p>The last bright comet visible to the naked eye was C/2024 G3 (ATLAS), observed in January 2025.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers should prepare for opportunities to view Comet Lemmon starting in early October 2025, with the best chances occurring during its closest approach later that month.</p>
