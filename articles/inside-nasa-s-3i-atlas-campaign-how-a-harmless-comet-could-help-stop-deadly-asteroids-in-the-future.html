      <h2>Inside NASA’s 3I/ATLAS campaign: How a harmless comet could help stop deadly asteroids in the future</h2>

<p>NASA scientists have begun monitoring a fast-moving interstellar comet called 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through our solar system. Discovered earlier this year, 3I/ATLAS is not considered dangerous, but the project surrounding it could aid in preventing future space threats to Earth. The comet is expected to exit our solar system between 27 November 2025 and 27 January 2026, according to NASA.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it allows NASA and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) to enhance their capabilities in detecting and predicting the movements of potentially hazardous objects. The comet will not approach Earth closely; its nearest point will be approximately 1.8 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, according to Space.com.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>Discovered: Earlier in 2023</li>
    <li>Expected exit from solar system: 27 November 2025 - 27 January 2026</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: Approximately 1.8 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Registration deadline for citizen scientists: 7 November 2023</li>
    <li>Workshops and teleconferences begin: 10 November 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered earlier in 2023. NASA initiated its monitoring campaign following the discovery, aiming to improve detection methods for hazardous near-Earth objects. The campaign will culminate with the comet's exit from the solar system, projected for late 2025 to early 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The campaign will target comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) to exercise the capability of the observing community to extract accurate astrometry,” the Minor Planet Center stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The IAWN was established after the United Nations recommended an international response to threats posed by near-Earth objects. This campaign represents a critical exercise in planetary defense, testing the coordination and preparedness of global scientific efforts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to gather data from the observations of 3I/ATLAS, refining global systems for detecting potential impact threats as the comet approaches its exit from the solar system.</p>
