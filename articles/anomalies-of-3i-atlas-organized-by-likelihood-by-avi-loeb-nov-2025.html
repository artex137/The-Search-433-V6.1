      <h2>Anomalies of Comet 3I/ATLAS Summarized by Avi Loeb</h2>

<p>On November 22, 2025, astronomer Avi Loeb published an analysis of the anomalies associated with the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The report categorizes these anomalies by their likelihood and suggests potential implications for future research. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</p>

<p>This analysis matters as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory. Authorities in the scientific community are examining these anomalies to understand whether they indicate something extraordinary, such as artificial technology or unusual physical characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to encounter Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The predicted perijove distance is 53.445 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Loeb categorizes anomalies into major and medium likelihoods, with probabilities ranging from P=0.00004 to P=0.006.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has shown a sunward jet and unusual gas compositions.</li>
    <li>The comet is roughly a million times more massive than 1I/'Oumuamua.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July and August 2025, 3I/ATLAS displayed a sunward jet, confirmed by images taken during its closest approach to Mars. On March 16, 2026, it is expected to encounter Jupiter, allowing further observation of its anomalies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The forecasted perijove distance of 3I/ATLAS during its encounter with Jupiter might indicate intentional behavior,” Loeb stated in his analysis. “This raises the possibility that the comet could release technological devices.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This report follows the discovery of other interstellar objects, such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have also sparked interest in the nature of objects entering the solar system. Previous studies have focused on the physical characteristics and origins of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026, with an emphasis on analyzing its trajectory and composition to determine the validity of the anomalies reported by Loeb.</p>
