      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: When will interstellar comet emerge from Sun's glare?</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has become partially visible as it emerges from behind the Sun, with a photo taken by the Lowell Observatory in Arizona on October 31, 2025. The image was shared by Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, who notes that the comet's close encounter with the Sun has provided new insights into its properties and behaviour.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it may reveal anomalies in 3I/ATLAS that challenge existing scientific understanding. Authorities, including the European Space Agency, are preparing to monitor the comet closely, with the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) scheduled to study it from November 2 to 25, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS became visible on October 31, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 64 million kilometres from JUICE during observations.</li>
    <li>JUICE will conduct its first observation on November 4, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has exhibited unexpected brightness and water release near the Sun.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has reported that the comet may have a debris cloud weighing about 5 billion tons.</li>
    <li>The comet may have lost 15% of its mass due to non-gravitational acceleration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 31, 2025, the Lowell Discovery Telescope captured an image of 3I/ATLAS as it emerged from the Sun's glare. This visibility has prompted scientists to investigate the comet's unexpected behaviour, including its sudden increase in brightness and water release. The European Space Agency's JUICE is scheduled to observe the comet from November 2 to 25, 2025, with its first observation planned for November 4.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Without an established physical explanation, the outlook for 3I's postperihelion behaviour remains uncertain,” said Qicheng Zhang of Lowell Observatory. “A plateau in brightness — or even a brief continuation of its preperihelion brightening — appears as plausible as rapid fading past perihelion.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet, meaning it originates from outside the solar system. Its unique properties may differ from typical comets found within the solar system, particularly those from the Oort cloud. Scientists have noted that interstellar travel could have influenced its composition and behaviour, which may provide insights into its planetary origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The upcoming observations by JUICE will be crucial for understanding the anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS. Scientists will analyze data to determine whether the comet exhibits the expected physical characteristics or if it reveals new, unexplained phenomena.</p>
