      <h2>3I/ATLAS: First Video Since Vanishing Raises Fears It's 'Breaking Apart'</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed for the first time since it vanished behind the Sun in late October. On Sunday, 9 November 2025, astronomer Joan Miguel Gonzalez Navarra of the Sabadell Institute captured video footage of the comet drifting through the Solar System. Navarra noted that the comet appeared to be falling apart during a 20-minute observation consisting of 20 exposures, each lasting 60 seconds.</p>

<p>This new footage is significant for scientists and space enthusiasts as it raises concerns about the comet's structural integrity after its close approach to the Sun. The observations may provide insights into the comet's composition and behaviour as it interacts with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: 9 November 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Sabadell Institute</li>
    <li>Duration of video: 20 minutes</li>
    <li>Number of exposures: 20</li>
    <li>Length of each exposure: 60 seconds</li>
    <li>Illumination: 83% illuminated Moon</li>
    <li>Previous observations: Tianwen-1 Orbiter captured images from 30 million kilometres away</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted earlier in 2025. It vanished behind the Sun in late October, leading to a period of uncertainty regarding its condition. On 9 November 2025, Joan Miguel Gonzalez Navarra captured the first video footage of the comet since its disappearance.</p>
<p>Prior to Navarra's observation, the Chinese Tianwen-1 Orbiter took photographs of 3I/ATLAS, allowing scientists to study its features and trajectory as it approached the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We don't have any evidence for the gas coma changing colours,” said Qicheng Zhang of the Lowell Observatory. “Our result just showed that the gas coma is likely still around and contributing substantially to the overall brightness.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Zhang also expressed frustration with conspiracy theories surrounding the comet, stating, “A large fraction of misinformation I've seen floating around can be directly traced back to [Dr. Avi Loeb] misinterpreting, not fully reading the papers or data he comments on.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS has led to various speculations and conspiracy theories about its nature, including suggestions that it might be an alien spacecraft. Scientists, including Zhang, have sought to clarify these misconceptions, emphasizing that the comet's behaviour is consistent with typical cometary activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the video footage and additional observations from other missions, such as the upcoming Tianwen-2 mission, will likely provide more information about 3I/ATLAS and its characteristics as it continues its journey through the Solar System.</p>
