      <h2>SPHEREx Re-Observation of Comet 3I/ATLAS in December 2025</h2>

<p>In December 2025, the NASA SPHEREx spacecraft has re-observed interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, revealing significant post-perihelion activity compared to earlier observations in August 2025. The findings indicate the object is evolving into a cometary body that is fully sublimating its ices.</p>

<p>This re-observation is important for understanding the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. NASA scientists aim to analyze the new data to gain insights into the formation and evolution of comets and other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: December 2025</li>
    <li>Previous observation: August 2025</li>
    <li>Key findings include increased activity and new gas emissions</li>
    <li>Notable gases detected: CN, H<sub>2</sub>O, organic C-H, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CO</li>
    <li>CO<sub>2</sub> gas-coma extended to a 3 arcmin radius</li>
    <li>Study submitted to RNAAS by C.M. Lisse and co-authors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2025, SPHEREx conducted its first observations of 3I/ATLAS prior to perihelion, establishing a baseline for the object's activity. In December 2025, the spacecraft re-observed the object, noting a marked increase in activity and changes in its physical characteristics.</p>
<p>During the December observations, scientists detected gas emissions and dust features that were not present in the August data, indicating a significant transformation in the object's behavior as it continues its orbit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new imaging spectrophotometry shows the object is developing into a fully active comet,” said C.M. Lisse, a lead researcher on the project.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This provides us with valuable information about the processes occurring as interstellar objects approach the sun,” Lisse added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object that has garnered attention since its discovery. The study of such objects helps scientists understand the materials and conditions that exist outside our solar system. Previous observations of other interstellar objects have indicated varying levels of activity based on their proximity to the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA scientists will continue to analyze the data from the December observations, focusing on the implications of the increased activity and the presence of new gas species. Further studies may provide deeper insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
