      <h2>View Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Through NASA’s Multiple Lenses</h2>

<p>NASA has launched an extensive observation campaign to track comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. The comet was first discovered on July 1, and NASA has utilized twelve of its assets to capture images of the comet since its discovery. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This observation campaign is significant because it allows scientists to compare 3I/ATLAS with comets originating from within our solar system. By studying the comet's composition, researchers hope to gain insights into the differences between various solar systems. NASA's ongoing observations will continue as the comet travels through our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: 19 million miles.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023, at 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA assets involved: 12 spacecraft and telescopes.</li>
    <li>Observations from Mars: Conducted by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, and Perseverance rover.</li>
    <li>Observations from heliophysics missions: From September 11 to October 2, and October 15-16, 2023.</li>
    <li>Future trajectory: Passing the orbit of Jupiter in spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observed the comet later that month. In August, both the James Webb Telescope and SPHEREx captured images of the comet. The comet passed Mars on September 8 and 9, where the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN captured imagery. Observations continued from various NASA assets, including the STEREO and SOHO missions in October.</p>

<p>Throughout September and October, NASA’s PUNCH mission observed the comet’s tail, marking the first time that NASA’s heliophysics missions have purposefully tracked an object from another solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By observing the comet from so many locations, NASA has an opportunity to learn about the ways that 3I/ATLAS differs from our solar system’s home-grown comets,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects, following the discovery of other similar bodies in recent years. This observation campaign represents NASA's commitment to expanding our understanding of the solar system and beyond, using advanced technology and collaborative efforts across multiple missions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to observe comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and moves toward the orbit of Jupiter in spring 2026. Further analysis of the collected data will provide insights into the comet's composition and trajectory.</p>
