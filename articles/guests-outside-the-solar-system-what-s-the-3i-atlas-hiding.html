      <h2>Guests Outside the Solar System: What’s the 3i Atlas Hiding?</h2>

<p>Kathmandu has welcomed a new interstellar visitor, the comet 3i Atlas, discovered in July 2025. This object has surprised both scientists and the general public as it approaches the solar system. The comet, which poses no risk of collision, has sparked discussions about its origins and the potential for extraterrestrial life, though no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The arrival of the 3i Atlas is significant for the scientific community. It provides a unique opportunity to study the formation of star systems outside our own and to explore the chemical elements necessary for life. Authorities are now considering future robotic missions to study such interstellar visitors more closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Size: Estimated between 7 to 12 miles (12–20 km)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: End of November 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: Traveling at 1.3 million miles per hour</li>
    <li>Risk of collision: None reported</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the 3i Atlas comet was discovered by Chile’s Atlas Survey Telescope. After traveling billions of years from an outer star system, it made its closest approach to the Sun in late November 2025. Currently, it is moving away from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object is a completely natural, ancient comet, which has nothing to do with alien activity,” scientists have stated, dismissing speculations about extraterrestrial origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of the 3i Atlas marks the third interstellar object to visit our solar system. Past incidents involving similar objects have often led to public speculation about alien life, though the scientific community consistently emphasizes their natural origins. This ongoing narrative highlights the human curiosity surrounding the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, scientists are exploring the possibility of sending robotic missions to study the 3i Atlas and similar objects in greater detail. This exploration could unlock new insights into the origins of water, organic matter, and potentially life on Earth.</p>
