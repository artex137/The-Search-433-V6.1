      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Shows Green Glow</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has recently transitioned from a reddish hue to a greenish glow, according to observations from the ATLAS telescope team on September 7, 2025. The new coloration is believed to be linked to a significant increase in cyanide production, as reported by the Very Large Telescope on August 25, 2025.</p>

<p>This change in color is significant as it may indicate alterations in the comet's composition and behavior as it approaches the Sun. Researchers are closely monitoring the comet's activity and have released data dating back to March 28, 2025, to further understand these developments.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: September 7, 2025</li>
    <li>Initial reddish color observed until recent data</li>
    <li>Increase in cyanide production noted on August 25, 2025</li>
    <li>Data released dating back to March 28, 2025</li>
    <li>Hubble Space Telescope image taken on July 21, 2025</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS's heliocentric distance: varies, currently approaching the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On March 28, 2025, the ATLAS telescope team began collecting data on 3I/ATLAS. By July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images revealing an extension of scattered light towards the Sun. On August 6 and August 8–12, 2025, data from the Webb Space Telescope and SPHEREx space observatory indicated a plume of gas around the comet, primarily composed of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>On August 25, 2025, the Very Large Telescope reported a dramatic increase in cyanide production, leading to the new green glow observed in September.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anomalous evolution from red to green-blue suggests a significant shift in the materials being emitted by 3I/ATLAS,” said a member of the ATLAS telescope team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been noted for its unique characteristics compared to other interstellar objects. Unlike the first interstellar object, 1I/`Oumuamua, which showed no signs of evaporation, or the second, 2I/Borisov, which behaved like a typical comet, 3I/ATLAS exhibits anomalous features that have sparked interest among astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, analyzing its behavior and composition. Further observations and data releases are expected in the coming months to enhance understanding of this unusual comet.</p>
