      <h2>4 Recently Discovered Green Comets Are Racing Through Our Solar System</h2>

<p>Four green comets, including the interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS, are currently traveling through our solar system, with the closest approaches to Earth occurring from late October to mid-December 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This celestial event is significant as it presents a rare opportunity for astronomers and skywatchers to observe multiple comets simultaneously. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring the comets' trajectories and physical properties as they approach the Sun and Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comets:</strong> 3I/ATLAS, LEMMON, SWAN, C/2025 K1 (ATLAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach of Comet LEMMON:</strong> October 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach of Comet SWAN:</strong> October 20, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach of Comet 3I/ATLAS:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 170 million miles or 270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Ejection rate of water from 3I/ATLAS:</strong> 88 pounds per second</li>
    <li><strong>Closest solar approach of 3I/ATLAS:</strong> October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units (about 130 million miles or 210 million kilometers)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet LEMMON was discovered on January 3, 2025, and will make its closest approach to Earth on October 21, 2025. Comet SWAN was discovered in September 2025 and will be closest to Earth on October 20, 2025.</p>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered in May 2025 and is currently brightening as it approaches the Sun. It is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on November 25, 2025.</p>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 and will reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of hydroxyl gas indicates that Comet 3I/ATLAS is ejecting water vapor at a torrential rate of about 88 pounds per second,” according to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event marks a rare occurrence of multiple comets being visible from Earth simultaneously. Previous comet sightings have often occurred in isolation, making this situation unique and noteworthy for both scientists and the public.</p>

<p>The discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS has raised questions about its origins and the significant amount of water it appears to be ejecting, which is unusual for a comet at such a distance from the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor the comets as they approach the Sun and Earth. Observations will focus on understanding the physical properties of 3I/ATLAS and its water ejection phenomenon. The comets will remain visible to ground-based telescopes until at least September 2025.
