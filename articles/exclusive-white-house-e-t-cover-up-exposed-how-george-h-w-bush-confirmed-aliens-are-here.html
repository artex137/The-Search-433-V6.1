      <h2>Former President George H.W. Bush's UFO Encounter Disclosure Revealed</h2>
<p>A new disclosure has emerged regarding former President George H.W. Bush's knowledge of an encounter between U.S. military personnel and extraterrestrial beings at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico over 60 years ago. Dr. Eric Davis, a former member of the Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), asserts that Bush briefed him on this extraordinary event in 2003, a decade after leaving office.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it sheds light on long-standing government secrets about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and extraterrestrial interactions. Authorities are now revisiting historical accounts of UFO encounters and examining the implications of such disclosures on national security and public understanding of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.</li>
    <li>Incident took place in 1964; disclosure made in 2003.</li>
    <li>Dr. Eric Davis claims Bush was informed about the event by military personnel.</li>
    <li>Three UFOs were reported to have buzzed the base, with one landing.</li>
    <li>A non-human entity reportedly deboarded the craft and interacted with personnel.</li>
    <li>Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented on governmental secrecy regarding UFOs.</li>
    <li>Other testimonies in the documentary suggest a secret government UFO retrieval program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1964, three unidentified flying objects were reported near Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. One of these UFOs reportedly landed, and a non-human entity emerged and interacted with military and CIA personnel. In 2003, Dr. Eric Davis claims he received a briefing from George H.W. Bush regarding this encounter. During this conversation, Bush expressed interest in learning more but was informed by his aides that he "did not have a need to know." The documentary "The Age of Disclosure" brings these details to light, highlighting the longstanding secrecy surrounding such incidents.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "A non-human entity deboarded the craft ... and interacted with uniformed Air Force and civilian CIA personnel," Dr. Eric Davis said regarding the encounter.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "There's this assumption that presidents can walk into the Oval Office on day one and say, 'All right, take me to Roswell [New Mexico]… I want to see the whole thing.' I think that really is a naive understanding of how our government works," said Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The bodies recovered are not all the same type," said Hal Puthoff, a quantum physicist and former AATIP member. "Whoever it is, they're here – and they've been operating here for a long time."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This disclosure aligns with a growing trend of transparency regarding UFOs and government investigations into extraterrestrial life. Past incidents, such as the Roswell incident in 1947, have fueled public interest and speculation. The documentary also references a secretive "Legacy Program" investigating extraterrestrial encounters, contributing to the ongoing debate about the government's role in disclosing information about UFOs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into past UFO incidents, including the Legacy Program, are expected to continue as authorities seek to clarify the extent of government knowledge regarding extraterrestrial interactions. Further disclosures may emerge as public interest in UFOs remains high.</p>
