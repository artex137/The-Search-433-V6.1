      <h2>Exclusive: White House E.T. Cover-Up Exposed!</h2>

<p>A new disclosure reveals that former President George H.W. Bush learned about an encounter between U.S. military personnel and extraterrestrial beings at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico over 60 years ago. This information comes from Dr. Eric Davis, a former Pentagon astrophysicist, in the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>.</p>

<p>This revelation raises questions about government transparency concerning UFO encounters. Authorities, including members of Congress, are reassessing the implications of such disclosures on national security and public knowledge of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in 1964 at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.</li>
    <li>George H.W. Bush, who passed away in 2018, reportedly learned of the encounter in 2003.</li>
    <li>Three UFOs were reported to have buzzed the base, with one landing.</li>
    <li>A non-human entity allegedly interacted with Air Force and CIA personnel.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) has investigated such incidents.</li>
    <li>Gary Nolan, a Stanford immunologist, stated he treated soldiers with severe injuries after UFO encounters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1964, three unidentified flying objects were reported at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. One of these UFOs landed, and a non-human entity reportedly disembarked and interacted with military personnel. In 2003, George H.W. Bush briefed Dr. Eric Davis about this encounter. Bush expressed a desire to learn more but was told he did not have a need to know.</p>

<p>In recent years, the Pentagon's AATIP has explored various UFO incidents, including claims of extraterrestrial encounters. The documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> includes testimony from various scientists, including Gary Nolan and Hal Puthoff, discussing their findings and experiences related to these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "A non-human entity deboarded the craft ... and interacted with uniformed Air Force and civilian CIA personnel," said Dr. Eric Davis, referencing Bush's account of the incident.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "There's this assumption that presidents can walk into the Oval Office on day one and say, 'All right, take me to Roswell ... I want to see the whole thing,'" said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, highlighting misconceptions about governmental access to UFO information.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The bodies recovered are not all the same type," stated Hal Puthoff, emphasizing the existence of multiple alien species visiting Earth.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident aligns with ongoing discussions regarding UFOs and government secrecy. Historical events, such as the Roswell incident in 1947, have fueled public interest and speculation about extraterrestrial life. The establishment of the AATIP reflects the U.S. government's acknowledgment of the need to investigate aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UFO encounters are expected to continue, with congressional hearings anticipated. Authorities will likely examine the implications of these revelations on national security and public policy regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
