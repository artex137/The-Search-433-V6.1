      <h2>Mysterious 3I/ATLAS object vanishes and reappears as two spacecraft begin their race to uncover its secrets</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captured the attention of researchers as it currently hides behind the Sun, making it difficult to analyze. The object is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>Scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it becomes nearly ten times brighter while approaching the Sun. The spacecraft GOES-19 and SOHO are tasked with observing the comet to understand its composition, behavior, and potential threats to Earth from similar objects in the future. The object is currently not visible from Earth due to the Sun's glare.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently hidden behind the Sun.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is expected on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>GOES-19 and SOHO are monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet has become nearly ten times brighter as it approaches the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 5.6 kilometers wide, according to the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be about 7.6 billion years old.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to reappear in early December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers have observed that 3I/ATLAS is not currently visible from Earth due to its position on the opposite side of the Sun. However, spacecraft such as STEREO-A, SOHO, and GOES-19 have continued to track the object. The GOES-19 images revealed a large glowing cloud, or coma, around the comet, measuring roughly four arcminutes wide. This brightening is attributed to the Sun's heat causing the comet to release gas and dust.</p>

<p>As the object approaches perihelion, scientists have noted that it appears bluer than the Sun, indicating a significant amount of gas is being emitted. By March 2026, 3I/ATLAS is expected to be near Jupiter, allowing for comparisons with comets from our own solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This brightening behaviour mirrors that of highly active comets within our solar system, but for an interstellar body, it’s extraordinary. We are essentially witnessing material from another star system responding to our Sun for the first time,” said NASA researcher Zhang.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, and its unique characteristics have drawn significant interest from scientists. The object is believed to be the oldest comet ever found, formed three billion years before the solar system. As researchers study its properties, they hope to gain insights into the formation of other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion and reappears in early December 2025. Researchers are eager to gather more data about the comet's composition and behavior, particularly when it becomes visible to telescopes.</p>
