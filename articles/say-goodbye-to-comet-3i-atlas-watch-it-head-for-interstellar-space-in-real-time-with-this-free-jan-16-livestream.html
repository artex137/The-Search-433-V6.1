      <h2>Say goodbye to Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is heading away from the sun on an escape trajectory from the solar system, with a livestream event scheduled for today, January 16, at 5 p.m. EST (2100 GMT) to mark its departure. The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has since become one of the most significant interstellar objects observed.</p>

<p>This event is notable as it provides a unique opportunity for the public to witness the comet in real-time. The livestream, hosted by the Virtual Telescope Project, will feature views from a 14-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain robotic telescope located in Manciano, Italy, weather permitting. Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project, emphasized the rarity of this event, calling it “a very precious opportunity to personally see, in real-time, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event date:</strong> January 16, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream start time:</strong> 5 p.m. EST (2100 GMT)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion (closest approach to the sun):</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Next milestone:</strong> Close pass of Jupiter in March 2026 at approximately 33.4 million miles (53.7 million kilometers)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and quickly confirmed to be the third interstellar object visiting our solar system. It made its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025, during an event known as perihelion. The comet was not visible to observers on Earth during this time as it passed behind the sun.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, passing at a distance of 168 million miles. The livestream event on January 16, 2026, will allow viewers to see the comet as it continues its journey out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a very precious opportunity to personally see, in real-time, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, one of the most important discoveries of the last decade,” said Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is one of the few interstellar objects identified in our solar system. Its trajectory has confirmed that it is not gravitationally bound to our sun, marking it as an alien visitor. The comet has provided insights into the nature of such objects, which are essential for understanding the formation of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its close approach to Jupiter in March 2026, Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey into interstellar space, coasting beyond the outer planets and eventually passing through the Oort cloud over the course of several thousand years.</p>
