      <h2>Steven Spielberg’s Alien Obsession Started With One Night When He Was 10</h2>

<p>Steven Spielberg’s fascination with UFOs began on a night in 1957 in the Arizona desert when his father, Arnold Spielberg, woke him up to watch a meteor shower. The experience has influenced Spielberg’s career and his storytelling, leading to iconic films such as ‘Close Encounters of the Third Kind’ and ‘E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial’.</p>

<p>This early encounter has shaped Spielberg’s approach to filmmaking and his perceptions of extraterrestrial life. Authorities and film historians have noted how this pivotal moment in his childhood has driven his lifelong interest in UFO mythology and storytelling beyond this world.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1957, a young Spielberg witnessed a meteor shower in the Arizona desert, an experience described by his father as a “bright canopy of dust.” This moment ignited Spielberg's fascination with UFOs and the cosmos.</p>
<p>By the age of 16, Spielberg began working on his first film, Firelight, inspired by stories from his Boy Scout peers about UFO sightings. He took the subject seriously, marking the start of his cinematic journey.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, Spielberg wrote a treatment about children encountering UFOs, which Columbia Pictures purchased. His research included consulting astronomer J. Allen Hynek, whose work influenced Spielberg’s approach to UFO narratives.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There have been enough sober reports from very reliable, multiple witnesses,” Spielberg said in 1977 regarding UFO sightings. “Individuals who have all seen these things all over the world.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Spielberg’s early experiences have paralleled a broader cultural fascination with UFOs, particularly in the 1970s when public interest surged due to various sightings and government investigations. His films have helped shape mainstream perceptions of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Despite not claiming to have witnessed a UFO himself, Spielberg has maintained a belief in the validity of those who report such encounters. His work has consistently reflected curiosity rather than certainty.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the conversation around UFOs continues to evolve, Spielberg remains engaged, stating that recent government disclosures about sightings are “fascinating.” He emphasizes the importance of transparency regarding these phenomena and the need for continued exploration of the subject.</p>
