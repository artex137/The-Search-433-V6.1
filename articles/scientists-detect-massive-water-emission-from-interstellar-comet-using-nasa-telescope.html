      <h2>Scientists detect massive water emission from interstellar comet using NASA telescope</h2>

<p>Researchers at Universidade of Auburn have confirmed the significant presence of water in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using data from NASA's Observatório Neil Gehrels Swift. The discovery marks an important advance in the study of celestial bodies from outside the solar system. Observations show that the comet continuously releases water vapor, despite its distance from the Sun.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS has a composition rich in volatiles, preserved throughout its journey through interstellar space. The study provides new insights into the chemical diversity of the galaxy and the formation of stellar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS loses approximately <strong>40 kilograms</strong> of water every second.</li>
    <li>The comet's water emission rate is comparable to a fire hose operating at maximum capacity.</li>
    <li>The detection of water vapor was made using the Swift telescope's ultraviolet equipment between <strong>July and August 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>This is the <strong>third interstellar object</strong> confirmed to cross the solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to become visible again to sensitive instruments in <strong>mid-November 2026</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July and August 2025, researchers used the Swift telescope to observe the spectral signature of hydroxyl, a byproduct of water molecules broken down by sunlight. This allowed them to quantify the mass loss of the comet and model its behavior.</p>

<p>The comet’s activity is notable as it occurs in a region of space where most comets in the solar system remain inactive. The model proposed by researchers indicates that ice and dust particles are released from the comet's nucleus, which heats quickly in weak sunlight, thus maintaining the observed gas cloud.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun in October 2025, after which its brightness decreased significantly, complicating visual tracking by smaller telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of intact volatile ices in 3I/ATLAS indicates that the object managed to avoid intense radiation or excessive heating during its solitary path through the galaxy,” said a lead researcher from Universidade of Auburn.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in the solar system. The first, 1I/’Oumuamua, showed no evidence of water or significant cometary activity, while the second object, 2I/Borisov, exhibited a chemistry dominated by carbon monoxide. The comparative analysis of these objects highlights the diversity in the formation of stellar systems.</p>

<p>The presence of water in 3I/ATLAS suggests that water reservoirs may be common in other planetary systems, providing crucial clues about the environments where these bodies originated millions of years ago.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, with renewed observations expected in mid-November 2026. These observations will allow scientists to verify how the comet’s activity evolved after perihelion and refine data regarding its exit route from the solar system.</p>
