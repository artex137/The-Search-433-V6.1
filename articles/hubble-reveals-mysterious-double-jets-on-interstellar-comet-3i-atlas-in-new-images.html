      <h2>Hubble reveals mysterious double jets on interstellar comet 3I/Atlas in new images</h2>

<p>New images from the Hubble Space Telescope, taken on December 12 and December 27, 2025, have revealed an unusual structure in the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas as it travels away from the Solar System. The comet, which passed near the Sun in October, displays two jets of material, one directed towards the Sun, known as the antitail. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the comet's behavior and potential internal processes. Experts, including astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University, have analyzed the data and presented their interpretations in a report published on December 28. The findings may enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their dynamics as they travel through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>New images taken by Hubble on December 12 and 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet 3I/Atlas passed close to the Sun in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb's analysis was published on December 28, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations used long exposures of 170 seconds with the WFC3 UVIS camera.</li>
    <li>Significant brightness variations were observed between the two imaging dates.</li>
    <li>Two jets have been identified, with one stronger than the other.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2025, comet 3I/Atlas passed close to the Sun, initiating its journey out of the Solar System. Observations using the Hubble Space Telescope began in July, revealing a narrow jet of material. By December 12 and 27, images captured the unusual double jets structure, leading to further analysis by astronomers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "We have two main hypotheses for the twin jets. The first considers emissions from opposite sides of the nucleus, while the second suggests both jets are from the illuminated side, but with different materials." </blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb emphasized, "While there is a speculative possibility of a technological origin, we must consider rare natural processes as the main explanation." </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of comet 3I/Atlas provides a unique opportunity to study interstellar material. Previous observations of comets have shown various jet structures, but the dynamics of 3I/Atlas may offer new insights into their formation in other systems. The presence of two jets suggests complex internal thermal conditions within the comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations are planned as comet 3I/Atlas continues to move away from the Solar System. Researchers will analyze spectroscopic data to measure the speed and composition of the jets, which may provide additional insights into their origins and behavior.</p>
