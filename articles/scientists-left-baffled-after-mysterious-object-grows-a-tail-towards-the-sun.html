      <h2>Scientists left baffled after mysterious object grows a tail towards the Sun</h2>

<p>Researchers have observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS developing a tail directed towards the Sun while traveling through the solar system. This unusual phenomenon has puzzled scientists since its discovery in July 2023, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>The significance of this observation lies in the fact that comet tails typically form in the opposite direction of the Sun due to solar radiation and wind. Authorities, including astronomers from various institutions, are investigating the comet's characteristics to better understand this anomaly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023.</li>
<li>It has displayed unusual characteristics, including a tail pointing towards the Sun.</li>
<li>The Keck II telescope in Hawaii observed the comet in August.</li>
<li>The comet is expected to make a close approach to Jupiter next month.</li>
<li>Nasa’s Juno spacecraft and the European Space Agency’s Juice spacecraft will observe the comet during this approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023, marking it as the third interstellar object identified within our solar system. By August, astronomers using the Keck II telescope in Hawaii noted the comet's tail pointing towards the Sun, which contradicts typical comet behaviour.</p>
<p>As researchers continued to analyze data from the Keck observations, they reported evidence of cyanide and nickel outgassing, further complicating the comet's classification.</p>
<p>The comet is set to approach Jupiter in the coming month, providing further opportunities for observation by space agencies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Most remarkably, the white light image of 3I/ATLAS does not show evidence for a familiar cometary tail, as expected for dust which scatters sunlight and is pushed away from the Sun by solar radiation pressure,” said Harvard professor Dr. Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“With a rotating comet nucleus… ejecta from a spot can come off with heliocentric velocity that puts it either in front of or behind the nucleus,” noted planetary astronomer Michael Busch from the University of California, Los Angeles.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks only the third time an interstellar object has entered our solar system. Previous theories about such objects have ranged from being alien probes to potential seeds for new planets.</p>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its anti-tail, challenge existing classifications of comets and may prompt a reevaluation of our understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter next month, with plans for Nasa's Juno and ESA's Juice spacecraft to gather further data on the comet's composition and behaviour.</p>
