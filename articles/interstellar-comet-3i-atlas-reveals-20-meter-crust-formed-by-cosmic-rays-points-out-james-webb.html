      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas reveals 20-meter crust formed by cosmic rays, points out James Webb</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has been observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, revealing a crust estimated to be between 15 and 20 meters deep, formed by cosmic rays. This discovery comes as researchers from the Real Instituto Belga and Aeronomia Espacial analyze data collected in August 2025, when the comet was approximately 445 million kilometers from Earth.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it offers insights into the long-term effects of cosmic radiation on celestial bodies traveling through deep space. The research provides a better understanding of how interstellar objects differ from those formed in our solar system. The analysis has prompted further studies to compare the comet's characteristics with those of local comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>It is traveling at a speed of 210,000 km/h and follows a hyperbolic trajectory.</li>
    <li>The crust detected is formed over billions of years due to exposure to galactic cosmic rays.</li>
    <li>Data were collected when the comet was 445 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Analysis indicates a CO2 to water (H2O) ratio of 7.6, the highest ever recorded for a comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system, located in Chile. In August 2025, detailed observations were conducted when the comet was 445 million kilometers from Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope revealed the comet's crust, formed over billions of years due to cosmic ray exposure. On October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, resulting in the sublimation of its surface crust and the release of gases and dust.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The crust detected on 3I/Atlas is a record of accumulated effects over galactic timescales,” said a researcher from the Real Instituto Belga. “This study enhances our understanding of how these cosmic travelers are shaped by their environment.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, interstellar comets had not been studied in detail regarding their chemical composition and structural changes due to cosmic radiation. Comets from our solar system typically possess more primitive materials due to the protective effects of the heliosphere, which filters cosmic radiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/Atlas to compare its data with that of local comets. Further studies aim to enhance the understanding of cometary evolution in different cosmic environments, especially following the changes observed after perihelion.</p>
