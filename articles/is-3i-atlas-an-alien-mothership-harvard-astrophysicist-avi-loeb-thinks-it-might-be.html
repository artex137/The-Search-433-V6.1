      <h2>Harvard Astrophysicist Proposes Extraterrestrial Origin for Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be an extraterrestrial "mothership" capable of sending smaller probes to Earth and other planets. The comet was discovered by NASA on July 1, 2025, and is currently approaching its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2025, at a distance of approximately 203 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This hypothesis is significant as it challenges conventional views of cometary bodies. Authorities, including the Galileo Project, are actively monitoring 3I/ATLAS for any signs of anomalous activity that could support Loeb's claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at perihelion: 203 million kilometers (1.36 astronomical units)</li>
    <li>Expected perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Width of 3I/ATLAS: approximately 12 miles</li>
    <li>Speed: exceeds 130,000 mph (58 km/s)</li>
    <li>Significant emissions detected: 1420 MHz signal resembling a Fibonacci pattern</li>
    <li>No collision risk to Earth as of October 29, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by NASA on July 1, 2025. Since then, it has been monitored for irregularities in its trajectory and composition. The comet is set to reach its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025. Observations have shown several anomalies, including a lack of a visible tail and unusual emissions.</p>
<p>On October 14, 2025, NASA's PUNCH satellites analyzed spectral data to assess the comet's composition. Ongoing monitoring includes efforts from the Galileo Project and other space agencies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “These features align with an engineered craft rather than a natural phenomenon,” said Loeb, who leads the Galileo Project dedicated to searching for extraterrestrial technology.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Loeb has criticized the U.S. government's silence on such phenomena, noting that the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office has reported no extraterrestrial evidence despite substantial defense funding.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The hypothesis surrounding 3I/ATLAS comes amid ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and potential extraterrestrial technology. Loeb's position highlights a perceived lack of transparency regarding such phenomena, especially in light of claims regarding recovered alien crafts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Real-time observations will continue to evaluate Loeb's theories against natural explanations. The comet is expected to become visible in the eastern sky before dawn around November 11, 2025, and large telescopes will be required for detailed viewing.</p>
