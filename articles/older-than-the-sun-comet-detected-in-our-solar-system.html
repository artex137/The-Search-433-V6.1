      <h2>'Older than the sun' comet detected in our solar system</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has been confirmed as an interstellar object and was discovered in July. This marks its detection in our solar system, with significant interest from the scientific community.</p>

<p>The comet is the fourth interstellar object identified and is one of the fastest, travelling at approximately 58 kilometres per second. Scientists believe it is billions of years old, prompting various theories about its origins. Authorities are currently conducting research to better understand its composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It travels at around 58 kilometres per second.</li>
    <li>It is the fourth interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
    <li>Scientists estimate the comet is billions of years old.</li>
    <li>Theories about its origins include speculation about extraterrestrial life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered. Following its detection, scientists confirmed it as an interstellar object, adding it to a short list of similar findings. The comet's unusual speed and age have prompted extensive analysis by researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is believed to be billions of years old, and we are eager to learn more about its origins,” said Associate Professor Michael Brown from Monash University's School of Physics and Astronomy.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of interstellar objects is rare, with 3I/ATLAS being only the fourth recorded. Previous findings have sparked interest in the potential for extraterrestrial life and the study of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze comet 3I/ATLAS to uncover more details about its composition and trajectory, with further studies expected in the coming months.</p>
