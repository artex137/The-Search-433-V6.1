      <h2>Norwich named one of the UK’s top UFO hotspots</h2>

<p>Norwich has been identified as one of the UK's leading UFO hotspots, according to new data released this week. The city ranked second in the country for reported UFO sightings per 100,000 residents, with a score of 89.3 over the last decade.</p>

<p>This ranking is significant as it highlights the prevalence of UFO sightings in urban areas. Authorities and researchers are now examining the data to understand the patterns of these reports and their implications for local communities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Norwich has reported a total of 128 UFO sightings in the last decade.</li>
    <li>The city scored 89.3 sightings per 100,000 locals.</li>
    <li>Six sightings were reported to the National UFO Reporting Centre (NUFORC).</li>
    <li>Three sightings were reported to the UFO Identified Group.</li>
    <li>117 sightings were reported on the Enigma Labs app.</li>
    <li>Llandudno, Wales, had the highest sightings per 100,000 people.</li>
    <li>Only one UFO sighting has been reported to Norfolk Constabulary since 2009.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Data was gathered from three platforms: NUFORC, the Enigma Labs app, and the UFO Identified Group over the past ten years. The findings were compiled and ranked by Casino.org.</p>
<p>Norwich’s 128 reported sightings placed it above major cities like Manchester, Leeds, and London, which ranked third, ninth, and 58th respectively.</p>
<p>In a separate inquiry, a Freedom of Information request to Norfolk Constabulary revealed that only one UFO sighting has been reported to police since 2009, occurring in Great Yarmouth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The data shows a surprising trend in urban areas, with Norwich standing out among its peers,” said a spokesperson from Casino.org regarding the findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This ranking comes amid a growing interest in UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena worldwide. The collection of sightings from various platforms indicates a shift in public engagement with such reports, suggesting that more people are willing to document their experiences.</p>
<p>Previously, local authorities have reported minimal engagement with UFO sightings, as evidenced by the single report to Norfolk Constabulary since 2009.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and researchers are expected to continue analyzing the data to better understand the factors contributing to the high number of sightings in Norwich and other urban areas.</p>
