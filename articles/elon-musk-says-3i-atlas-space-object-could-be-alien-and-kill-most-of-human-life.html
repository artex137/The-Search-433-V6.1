      <h2>Elon Musk says 3I/ATLAS space object 'could be alien' and 'kill most of human life'</h2>

<p>Elon Musk has stated that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is approaching Earth, 'could be alien' and poses a significant collision risk. The object is expected to come closest to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of 170 million miles.</p>

<p>This statement has raised concerns among scientists and space agencies, prompting them to closely monitor the object's trajectory. 3I/ATLAS has bewildered researchers since its discovery on July 1, 2023, and its unusual characteristics have sparked speculation about its origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth at Closest Approach:</strong> 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 130,000 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Observations:</strong> Non-gravitational accelerations detected</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Visitors:</strong> 1I/'Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System identified 3I/ATLAS as it traveled through the Solar System. Since then, scientists have monitored its trajectory and behavior. On October 30, 2023, researchers observed the object making non-gravitational accelerations as it reached its closest point to the Sun. In the following months, discussions about its potential origins have intensified, particularly after Musk's comments on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "It could be alien - I don't know," Musk said during the podcast, cautioning that the object must be monitored closely. "If it struck Earth it would like obliterate a continent type of thing. Maybe worse. Probably kill most of human life. If not all of us."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    Professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the object's anomalies indicate it "might" be an extraterrestrial spaceship, emphasizing that it is an object "meriting attention."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unusual behavior has led to increased interest in the study of interstellar visitors and their implications for humanity. The ongoing monitoring of 3I/ATLAS reflects a growing concern about potential threats posed by celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Space agencies will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as its closest approach date nears. Researchers plan to observe any changes in its trajectory and behavior leading up to December 19, 2023.</p>
