      <h2>'Other Atlas' turns GOLDEN following trip to the Sun that should have shredded it to pieces</h2>

<p>C/2025 K1 (ATLAS), a comet discovered in May by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), has turned golden after a close encounter with the Sun on October 8. The comet, which was not expected to survive this solar approach, remains intact and has transformed into a striking golden ribbon.</p>

<p>This unexpected survival and transformation of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is significant for astronomers, as it challenges existing knowledge about comet behaviour during solar encounters. Observations from multiple astrophotographers have confirmed the comet's unusual colour change, prompting further investigation into the chemical composition of comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> C/2025 K1 (ATLAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> May 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Close Encounter with the Sun:</strong> October 8, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Point to Earth:</strong> November 25, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> 9 (not visible to the naked eye)</li>
    <li><strong>Photographers:</strong> Dan Bartlett (California), other unnamed photographers in California and Arizona</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered by ATLAS in May 2023. On October 8, it made a close approach to the Sun, coming within 50 million kilometres. Despite expectations that the Sun's gravitational pull would destroy the comet, it emerged intact and displayed a golden hue. On October 29, Dan Bartlett took a photograph of the comet from June Lake, California, showcasing its distinct golden glow and long tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet was not supposed to survive its October 8th perihelion, but it did,” said astrophotographer Dan Bartlett. “It is now displaying a red/brown/golden colour rarely seen in comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Typically, comets appear white due to the sunlight they reflect, which contains all wavelengths of visible light. However, C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is exhibiting a rare golden colour. Astronomer David Schleicher noted that the comet lacks carbon-bearing molecules, which may contribute to its unique appearance. Past incidents involving comets, such as 12P/Pons-Brooks and C/2022 E3, have shown colour changes due to specific chemicals in their comas.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) will continue as it approaches Earth on November 25. Astronomers are expected to study its composition further to understand the reasons behind its unusual colour change.</p>
