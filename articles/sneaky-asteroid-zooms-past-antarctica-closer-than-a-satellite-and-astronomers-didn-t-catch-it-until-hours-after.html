      <h2>Sneaky asteroid zooms past Antarctica closer than a satellite</h2>

<p>A small asteroid named 2025 TF passed within 428 kilometers of Earth on Tuesday, September 30, at 8:47 p.m. EDT, surprising astronomers who did not detect it until hours later. No injuries or fatalities have been reported as a result of the asteroid's close approach.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has reported that the roughly giraffe-sized asteroid flew over Antarctica at a distance closer than some satellites. The event underscores the challenges astronomers face in tracking smaller near-Earth objects, as this asteroid posed no significant threat but could have interfered with spacecraft operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Asteroid 2025 TF passed Earth at 8:47 p.m. EDT on September 30 (0047 GMT on October 1).</li>
    <li>The asteroid reached a distance of 428 kilometers above Earth's surface.</li>
    <li>It measures between 1 to 3 meters wide (3.3 to 9.8 feet).</li>
    <li>No spacecraft were reported to be in the asteroid's path.</li>
    <li>This asteroid is not expected to return until April 2087.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 30, at 8:47 p.m. EDT, asteroid 2025 TF flew past Earth, undetected at the time of its approach. Astronomers from the Catalina Sky Survey, a NASA-funded initiative, first observed the asteroid hours later.</p>
<p>The ESA has since monitored the asteroid and confirmed its close approach, noting that it flew at an altitude similar to that of the International Space Station.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Astronomers at ESA's Planetary Defence Office observed the asteroid shortly after it was discovered,” ESA officials stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “NASA has paused all public communications during the ongoing U.S. government shutdown,” a NASA representative said, noting that updates will be provided when possible.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Asteroid 2025 TF is significantly smaller than the threshold for "potentially hazardous" asteroids, which must measure at least 140 meters in diameter and come within 7.48 million kilometers of Earth. This event highlights the ongoing efforts by space agencies like NASA and ESA to track near-Earth objects, even those that are not considered a threat.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to update its records regarding asteroid 2025 TF as more observations are made. The next close approach of this asteroid is not anticipated until April 2087. Meanwhile, astronomers continue to monitor other near-Earth objects for potential risks.</p>
