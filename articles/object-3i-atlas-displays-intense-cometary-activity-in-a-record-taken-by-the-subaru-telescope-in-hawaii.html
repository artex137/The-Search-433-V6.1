      <h2>Object 3I/ATLAS displays intense cometary activity in a record taken by the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii</h2>

<p>Astronomers at Observatório Subaru in Hawaii have reported significant cometary activity from the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS. The detailed observations were captured in mid-December 2025, when the object was approximately 27 million kilometers from Earth.</p>

<p>The findings are important as they classify 3I/ATLAS not merely as an inert asteroid but as a comet-like body, enhancing the understanding of the formation of distant star systems. The observations were made using high-precision instruments, which revealed a tail of dust and gas emanating from the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observations conducted by Observatório Subaru on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.</li>
    <li>Data capture occurred in mid-December 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was approximately 27 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
    <li>Object reached its maximum approach to Earth shortly after the observations.</li>
    <li>Confirmed to have a hyperbolic trajectory with an eccentricity greater than 1.</li>
    <li>Estimated to cross Jupiter's orbit in March 2026.</li>
    <li>Dust particles ejected at speeds of 22 meters per second for small particles and 2 meters per second for larger ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS took place in July 2025, detected by the ATLAS warning system in Chile. Following its initial identification, astronomers monitored the object closely as it approached the Solar System. Observations in mid-December 2025 confirmed its active behavior, revealing significant cometary features.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion—its closest point to the Sun—in October 2025, maintaining a safe distance of 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun. The object continues on a hyperbolic course, expected to cross Jupiter's orbit by March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The clarity of these images was critical to determining the dynamics of material ejection from the object’s surface,” said an astronomer involved in the observations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins a select group of interstellar visitors, including ‘Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov, which have been observed in recent years. Unlike ‘Oumuamua, which displayed no visible activity, 3I/ATLAS exhibits traditional cometary behavior, providing valuable insights into its composition.</p>

<p>The observations are part of a broader effort involving international collaboration, including contributions from the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA. This collective approach ensures comprehensive monitoring of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS. Further studies may yield insights into the formation of alien planetary systems and enhance understanding of interstellar objects as detection technologies improve.</p>
