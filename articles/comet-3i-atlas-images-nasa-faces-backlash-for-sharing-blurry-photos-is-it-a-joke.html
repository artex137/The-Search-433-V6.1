      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Images: NASA Faces Backlash For Sharing Blurry Photos; Is It A Joke?</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, a comet believed to be older than the solar system, sparking criticism for the quality of the visuals. The images were shared on X on Thursday, after being captured by eight different spacecraft, satellites, and telescopes, but many users have described them as low-quality.</p>

<p>The backlash highlights public frustration with NASA's handling of the comet's images. Critics have pointed out that the blurry photographs do not meet expectations set by the agency, especially given the advancements in astronomical imaging technology. NASA has stated that it will continue to capture images of 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA released images of 3I/ATLAS on X on Thursday.</li>
    <li>The comet was first spotted on July 1 by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The closest images were taken from 19 million miles away by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>NASA has used 12 of its assets to capture images of 3I/ATLAS since its discovery.</li>
    <li>Critics have compared NASA's images unfavourably to those taken by amateur astronomers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. Following its discovery, NASA began capturing images of the comet using various spacecraft and telescopes. The latest images were released on X on Thursday, prompting immediate backlash from users who criticized their quality.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "By observing the comet from so many locations, NASA has an opportunity to learn about the ways that 3I/ATLAS differs from our solar system’s home-grown comets and give scientists a new window into how the compositions of other systems may differ from our own," NASA said in a blog post.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The release of the images comes amid ongoing discussions about the quality of astronomical photography and the expectations placed on major space agencies. In recent years, various amateur astronomers have used advanced equipment to capture clearer images of celestial bodies, raising questions about the effectiveness and efficiency of government-funded space missions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, with additional images expected in the coming weeks. The agency aims to provide more detailed observations to enhance scientific understanding of the comet.</p>
