      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Enters Solar System</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, reported the discovery of comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, which has entered our Solar System from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. The comet is currently about 670 million kilometres away from Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers, as 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet, considered a primordial sample that can provide insights into the formation of distant star systems. Authorities have mobilized various powerful space telescopes to study the comet’s characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 670 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Estimated at 20 kilometres wide</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Travelling at about 60 km/s relative to the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> Expected around 30 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 1.4 AU (approximately 210 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Expected to be observable until September 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first reported by the ATLAS survey telescope on 1 July 2025. Following its discovery, astronomers began reviewing older data from various telescopes, including the Zwicky Transient Facility in California, to find pre-discovery observations as far back as 14 June 2025.</p>
<p>In July 2025, the Gemini North Telescope conducted observations that provided critical early characterization of the comet. By early August, the Hubble Space Telescope captured sharp images, revealing a dust plume and tail. Later in August, the SPHEREx mission and the James Webb Space Telescope confirmed the presence of water ice and carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sensitivity and scheduling agility of the International Gemini Observatory has provided critical early characterization of this interstellar wanderer,” said Martin Still, NSF program director for the International Gemini Observatory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Combining these observations... could be a unique chance to study its composition and behaviour as it warms up while approaching the Sun,” said Franck Marchis, Senior Astronomer at the SETI Institute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet poses no threat to Earth,” according to NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS are rare visitors to our Solar System. They are thought to be remnants from the formation of distant star systems, providing valuable data about the conditions in those environments. This discovery follows a trend of increased observation efforts by both professional astronomers and citizen scientists using advanced telescopes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, with observations planned until September 2025. After passing too close to the Sun for observation, the comet will reappear by early December 2025 for further study.</p>
