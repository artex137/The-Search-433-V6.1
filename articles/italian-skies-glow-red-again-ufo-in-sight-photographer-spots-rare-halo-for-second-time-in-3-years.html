      <h2>Italian skies glow red again - UFO in sight? Photographer spots rare halo for second time in 3 years</h2>

<p>A bright halo of red light has appeared over Possagno, Italy, on 17 November 2023, at approximately 10:45 p.m. local time. Nature photographer Valter Binotto captured the phenomenon, which is a rare atmospheric event known as an ELVE, or “emission of light and very low-frequency perturbations due to electromagnetic pulse sources.” This marks the second time in three years that such an appearance has been documented in the area.</p>

<p>The occurrence of ELVEs is significant as they are fleeting and often go unnoticed by the naked eye. According to reports from Spaceweather, the latest halo was slightly dimmer than the one Binotto photographed in March 2023. Authorities and meteorologists continue to study these phenomena to understand their causes and implications better.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of latest ELVE: 17 November 2023</li>
    <li>Time of appearance: 10:45 p.m. local time</li>
    <li>Photographer: Valter Binotto</li>
    <li>Distance from lightning strike: Approximately 300 km south of Possagno</li>
    <li>Size of ELVE: Spanned roughly 320 km in diameter, hovering about 160 km above Earth's surface</li>
    <li>Current of lightning strike: -303 kilo-ampères</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 17 November 2023, at 10:45 p.m. local time, Valter Binotto captured a red halo over Possagno. The phenomenon was caused by a powerful negative lightning strike originating from a storm in Vernazza, approximately 300 km to the south. This lightning generated an electromagnetic pulse that excited nitrogen molecules in the ionosphere, resulting in the ELVE's appearance.</p>

<p>This incident follows a similar event in March 2023, when Binotto photographed another ELVE in the same region. The previous occurrence was caused by a storm near Ancona, about 280 km away from Possagno.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I didn't capture any sprites, but fortunately, I managed to capture this Elve!" – Valter Binotto, in an email to Space.com.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The ELVE was generated by a powerful negative lightning strike in a storm in Vernazza about 300 km south of me." – Valter Binotto, in a statement to Spaceweather.com.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>ELVEs are rare atmospheric phenomena that occur during intense lightning storms. They last for only one-thousandth of a second, making them difficult to observe without specialized camera equipment. The previous incident in March 2023 also took place above Possagno, highlighting the area as a notable location for such rare occurrences, although no unique local conditions have been identified that would cause them.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and meteorologists are expected to continue monitoring atmospheric phenomena like ELVEs to better understand their formation and implications for weather patterns. Further studies may lead to enhanced predictive capabilities regarding such rare events.</p>
