      <h2>Celestial events that could be visible in the night sky</h2>

<p>An exciting celestial event will occur on Wednesday, October 8, as the Draconid meteor shower peaks across the entire United States. The meteor shower is associated with the comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner and will be active from October 6 to October 10.</p>

<p>This event matters as it offers a rare opportunity for skywatchers to observe meteors, with the potential for up to ten meteors per hour. NASA encourages the public to look toward the sky just after sunset for the best chance to see the meteors. The shower may produce bursts of meteors, with historical instances of over 100 meteors per hour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Draconid meteor shower</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Peaks on October 8, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Active period:</strong> October 6 - October 10</li>
    <li><strong>Meteors per hour:</strong> Up to 10, with potential bursts</li>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 21P/Giacobini-Zinner</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Visible throughout the U.S.</li>
    <li><strong>Next comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS, closest approach at 170 million miles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Draconid meteor shower is an annual event that occurs as Earth travels through the debris left by comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner. The meteors are expected to peak on October 8, 2023, after being active since October 6.</p>
<p>In addition, a newly-discovered comet, 3I/ATLAS, is noted for being the third known object from outside the solar system to pass through the vicinity of Earth. Its closest approach to Earth will be approximately 170 million miles.</p>
<p>This comet will not be observable until it emerges on the other side of the sun by early December 2025, when it can be viewed with ground-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known object from outside our solar system to be discovered passing through our celestial neighborhood,” according to NASA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Draconid meteor shower has been a notable event for astronomy enthusiasts, providing opportunities for public engagement with celestial phenomena. The historical records indicate instances where the shower produced significant meteor activity, capturing the interest of skywatchers.</p>
<p>The discovery of comets from outside the solar system, such as 3I/ATLAS, enhances the understanding of celestial bodies and their movements within our galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to prepare for the Draconid meteor shower on October 8 and to monitor updates regarding the visibility of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December 2025.</p>
