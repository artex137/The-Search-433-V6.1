      <h2>Mysterious bright light over Ireland’s skies sparks UFO theories</h2>

<p>An unusual bright light has been observed in the skies across Ireland on Wednesday night, prompting speculation of UFOs. The light, reported to be moving from west to east and positioned lower in the sky than the moon, has been linked to a SpaceX rocket launch, according to various sources.</p>

<p>This incident has drawn significant attention on social media, with many users sharing their observations and theories. The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has been contacted for comments regarding the sighting.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: Wednesday night</li>
    <li>Location: Visible across Ireland</li>
    <li>Rocket launch: SpaceX Falcon 9 launched 29 Starlink satellites</li>
    <li>Launch time: Approximately 4:35 PM Irish time</li>
    <li>Reported by: Alan O’Reilly of Carlow Weather</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Wednesday evening, a bright light appeared in the sky across Ireland, leading to widespread speculation about its nature. Alan O’Reilly from Carlow Weather noted that the light was too high for a helicopter and silent in nature. Following its appearance, social media users began to share their observations, including photos and videos from various counties.</p>

<p>O’Reilly expressed confidence that the phenomenon was related to SpaceX’s recent rocket launch, which took place earlier that day at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It was the whole island, really,” O’Reilly told The Irish Times. “It lit up the whole sky.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What we saw was the frozen fuel and the ice crystals reflecting the light,” he explained. “It matched the time and direction perfectly.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous sightings of bright lights in the sky have often sparked similar UFO speculation. The phenomenon is typically linked to rocket launches or atmospheric conditions. SpaceX has been active in launching satellites for its Starlink project, contributing to increased visibility of such events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Irish Aviation Authority is expected to provide comments regarding the incident, and further investigations may be conducted to confirm the nature of the sighting.</p>
