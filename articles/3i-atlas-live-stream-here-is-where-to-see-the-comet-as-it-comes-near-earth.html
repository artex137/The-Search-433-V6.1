      <h2>3I/ATLAS live stream: Here is where to see the comet as it comes near Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of 270 million kilometres. This event is significant for astronomers who have been observing the comet as it travels through the solar system. The comet is expected to provide a spectacular view for those who wish to see it via live stream or telescope.</p>

<p>Authorities and astronomers are preparing for the event, as the comet will not pass particularly close to Earth, being nearly twice the average distance between the planet and the sun. Nevertheless, the approach marks an important moment for scientific observation and public interest in astronomy. The Virtual Telescope Project will host a live stream of the comet's flyby, allowing viewers to see the comet in real-time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will be 270 million kilometres away during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project will livestream the event starting at 11 pm EST on December 18, 2023.</li>
    <li>Observers need a telescope of 8 inches or larger to view the comet directly.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to fly by Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's Juice probe has already scanned the comet and sent back partial data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been visible to astronomers for several weeks, providing opportunities for observation and astrophotography. The comet's approach to Earth is a culmination of months of tracking since it was first discovered. Following its closest approach, it will begin its exit from the solar system.</p>

<p>The Virtual Telescope Project previously hosted a livestream of 3I/ATLAS in November, showcasing its trajectory and appearance. Observations from NASA's Juno spacecraft will occur after the comet's flyby of Jupiter in 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a remarkable opportunity for both scientists and the public to observe an interstellar visitor,” said an official from the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet documented in our solar system, following previous discoveries that have sparked interest in the study of celestial bodies from outside our solar system. The data collected from 3I/ATLAS will contribute to our understanding of cometary behavior and interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey out of the solar system. Observations from the European Space Agency's Juice probe will provide more data in the coming months, with complete findings expected to reach Earth by February 2024.</p>
