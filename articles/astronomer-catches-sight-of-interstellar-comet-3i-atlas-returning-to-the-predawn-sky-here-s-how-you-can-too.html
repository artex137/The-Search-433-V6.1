      <h2>Astronomer catches sight of interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS returning to the predawn sky</h2>

<p>Amateur astronomers can now view interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS in the predawn sky after it briefly moved out of sight during its close approach to the sun on October 30. The comet is currently visible in the constellation Virgo close to the eastern horizon, according to Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, has been confirmed as the third interstellar object known to have visited our solar system. Scientists have been analyzing the comet's light to learn more about its origins and the environment from which it came.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1</li>
    <li><strong>Close Approach to Sun:</strong> October 30</li>
    <li><strong>Current Visibility:</strong> Morning twilight in early November</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Constellation Virgo, near the eastern horizon</li>
    <li><strong>Observer:</strong> Qicheng Zhang, Lowell Observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1 and confirmed as an interstellar object shortly thereafter. It made a close approach to the sun on October 30, becoming less visible during this time. On November 1, Qicheng Zhang captured images of the comet as it re-emerged in the predawn sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The comet is now a fairly easy target in the morning for anyone with a camera on even a small telescope with clear skies and a low eastern horizon," Zhang said. "It currently doesn't look like much, just a blob that's slightly fuzzier than the stars around it, but it should rapidly become more visible over the next few days/weeks."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. Previous interstellar visitors have provided valuable insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues to move away from the sun, it may become less visible. Observers are encouraged to use telescopes or cameras to capture images of the comet, as its visibility may change unpredictably in the coming weeks.</p>
