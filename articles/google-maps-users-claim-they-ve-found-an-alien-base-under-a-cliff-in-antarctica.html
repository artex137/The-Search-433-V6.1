      <h2>Google Maps users claim they've found an 'alien base' under a cliff in Antarctica</h2>

<p>Google Maps users have reported discovering what they believe to be a crash-landed alien spaceship beneath a cliff in Antarctica. The coordinates for the alleged object are 66°16'24.5"S 100°59'03.5"E, approximately 90 miles from the coast and near the A. B. Dobrowolski Polar Station, a Polish research base.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked considerable interest and concern among conspiracy theorists and UFO enthusiasts on social media. Meanwhile, experts have weighed in, stating that the object is likely a natural formation rather than an extraterrestrial craft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Coordinates of the object: 66°16'24.5"S 100°59'03.5"E</li>
    <li>Distance from Mill Island: about 45 miles</li>
    <li>Distance from A. B. Dobrowolski Polar Station: about 6 miles</li>
    <li>First noted by users on Reddit in 2021</li>
    <li>Claimed to be a UFO by Scott C. Waring, a ufologist</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2021, users on Reddit began discussing the object, referring to it as a 'UFO crash site'. In 2023, Scott C. Waring reiterated claims about the object, suggesting it might be hidden on purpose.</p>

<p>Experts have since examined the object. Professor Bethan Davies, a glaciologist from the University of Newcastle, has stated that it is a 'small lake in a rock basin'. Laura Gerrish, a mapping specialist at the British Antarctic Survey, confirmed this assessment, noting the area is known for its ice-free regions and small lakes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "There is a small patch of snow and the warmer lake water has a lower albedo so it absorbs more solar radiation. This is melting the snow, giving it the semicircular arc - not a UFO." 
    — Professor Bethan Davies, University of Newcastle
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "This area is called the Bunger Hills, which is a largely ice-free region along the Knox Coast in Antarctica - and it has lots of small lakes and ponds." 
    — Laura Gerrish, British Antarctic Survey
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Google Maps has become a platform for numerous conspiracy theories, with users claiming to find evidence of extraterrestrial life. Previous claims have often been debunked by experts, who attribute such findings to natural formations or human-made structures.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are no current investigations regarding the object, as it has been identified by experts as a natural feature. Further discussions among the public and conspiracy theorists are likely to persist online.</p>
