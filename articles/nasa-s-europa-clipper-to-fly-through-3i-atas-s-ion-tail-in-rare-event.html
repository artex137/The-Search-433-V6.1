      <h2>NASA's Europa Clipper to fly through 3I/ATAS's ion tail in rare event</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper is set to fly through the ion tail of comet 3I/ATLAS on October 29, 2025, as part of its mission to study the icy moon of Jupiter. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This flyby is significant as it marks a rare opportunity for scientific observation of the ion tail of an interstellar comet. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has indicated that the spacecraft is equipped with the necessary instruments to potentially collect data from the tail, unlike the European Space Agency’s Hera spacecraft, which lacks the required tools. Officials are monitoring conditions leading up to the event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Spacecraft:</strong> NASA's Europa Clipper and ESA's Hera</li>
    <li><strong>Distance to Sun:</strong> 126 million miles (minimum distance)</li>
    <li><strong>Study Period for Hera:</strong> October 25 to November 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments:</strong> Europa Clipper has suitable instruments; Hera does not</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The trajectory of both NASA's Europa Clipper and ESA's Hera has been aligned to intersect with comet 3I/ATLAS's ion tail. This alignment has been confirmed through recent studies. The flyby is expected to occur on October 29, 2025, during a peak in the comet's activity due to its proximity to the Sun.</p>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper, designed for studying Jupiter's moon Europa, is anticipated to utilize its instruments for potential analysis of the ion tail. In contrast, ESA's Hera, which is on a mission to the binary asteroid Didymos and Dimorphos, will not be able to collect data from the tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“My understanding is that because Hera is not equipped with any in-situ instruments, there is no opportunity to measure any properties of the comet’s tail as it passes through,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, is the third interstellar visitor identified in our solar system. Comets typically exhibit two tails, a dust tail and an ion tail, but 3I/ATLAS has not previously shown an ion tail. Its close approach to the Sun may enhance its activity and visibility.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor solar wind conditions leading up to the flyby between October 30 and November 6, 2025. While the mission's success in collecting data from the ion tail is not confirmed, it remains a focus for ongoing research and observation.</p>
