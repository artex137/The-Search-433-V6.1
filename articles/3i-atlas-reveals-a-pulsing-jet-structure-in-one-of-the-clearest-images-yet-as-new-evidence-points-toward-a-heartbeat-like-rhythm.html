      <h2>3I/ATLAS Reveals Pulsing Jet Structure in New Image</h2>

<p>Astrophysicists have captured a new image of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS on November 28, 2025, from KalopaStars in Hawaii, revealing its jets behave in a structured, pulsing manner. The image is considered one of the clearest photographs of the comet to date, showcasing a jet extending from its nucleus and raising questions about its nature.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about comet behavior. Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist, has noted that the jets appear to pulse every 16.16 hours, suggesting a potential internal mechanism that could redefine our understanding of interstellar objects. Scientists are conducting further observations as 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest pass to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Image captured on November 28, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: KalopaStars, Hawaii</li>
    <li>Pulse cycle: 16.16 hours</li>
    <li>Nucleus size: 2.8 kilometers</li>
    <li>Jet ejection speed: ~440 meters per second</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 28, 2025, astronomers released a new image of 3I/ATLAS that displayed a clear, structured jet extending from its nucleus. This image prompted further investigation into the object's behavior and characteristics.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb analyzed the data and noted that early observations indicated periodic brightness changes every 16.16 hours. He suggested that these changes are due to pulsing jets rather than the shape of the nucleus.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The periodicity over 16.16 hours is not directly associated with the shape of the nucleus but rather with the collimated jets coming from it out to much larger distances.” — Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery builds on previous observations of 3I/ATLAS, which have shown unusual characteristics compared to typical comets. The object exhibits non-gravitational acceleration, a feature not commonly seen in natural comets.</p>
<p>The implications of this research could alter how scientists interpret the behavior of interstellar visitors, particularly if the jets are found to be controlled or engineered.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its behavior and gather more data. Observations in the coming weeks will help determine whether the pulsing jets are a result of natural processes or indicative of a technological origin.</p>
