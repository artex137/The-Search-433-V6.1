      <h2>3I/ATLAS pulses every 16.16 hours — could this affect Jupiter and Callisto?</h2>

<p>On December 10, 2025, scientists have reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting a brightening and dimming pattern every 16.16 hours. This phenomenon has raised questions about its potential effects on Jupiter and its moon, Callisto, although experts have stated there is no danger.</p>

<p>The unique pulsing pattern of 3I/ATLAS has intrigued researchers and sparked discussions online. Authorities, including NASA, have emphasized that the comet's behavior does not pose any risk to other celestial bodies. “Nothing dangerous is going on, and this pulse does not have any influence on Jupiter, Callisto, or any planet whatsoever; it is just a different way the comet reflects the sun,” a NASA spokesperson said.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS displays a brightening and dimming cycle every 16.16 hours.</li>
    <li>First observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is the third interstellar object ever discovered.</li>
    <li>Researchers are using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope to study the comet.</li>
    <li>Claims of danger to Jupiter and Callisto have been dismissed by experts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025. Since then, it has been under careful observation by telescopes worldwide. The comet's brightness has been noted to fluctuate in a regular pattern, prompting further investigation into the causes of these changes.</p>
<p>Recent data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has indicated that the brightness changes are primarily due to the comet's coma, rather than its solid surface. Researchers are now exploring the possibility of jet activity as a contributing factor to the observed pulsing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet’s pulse does not change its mass or path. It is not releasing dangerous radiation or pushing anything toward the planets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object discovered, following previous findings that have helped scientists understand celestial objects from outside our solar system. The regular pattern observed in 3I/ATLAS is a unique characteristic that distinguishes it from other comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue observing 3I/ATLAS for extended periods to confirm the consistency of the brightening pattern when the same section of the comet faces the Sun. This ongoing study aims to validate the jet activity theory and further enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
