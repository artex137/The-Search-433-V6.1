      <h2>Lucky cosmic hit: NASA probe could taste ion tail of 3I/ATLAS this week</h2>

<p>A U.S. spacecraft may have the opportunity to sample the ion tail of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun between October 30 and November 6, according to two European researchers. This event is significant as it offers a rare chance to collect data from interstellar visitors without leaving the solar system.</p>

<p>This alignment could allow NASA's Europa Clipper to capture particles from the comet, enhancing scientific understanding of interstellar comets and their origins. Researchers have noted that the spacecraft's instruments must be operational during the brief alignment window, which could be complicated by a potential U.S. government shutdown. The success of the sampling also depends on favorable space weather conditions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion on October 29 at approximately 126 million miles from the sun.</li>
  <li>Europa Clipper is currently about 186 million miles from the sun.</li>
  <li>The alignment for potential sampling occurs between October 30 and November 6.</li>
  <li>The European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft may also encounter wind streams from the comet between October 25 and November 1.</li>
  <li>Europa Clipper carries instruments for detecting charged particles and magnetic fields.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 25, the European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft may begin to cross wind streams that interacted with comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet reaches perihelion on October 29, allowing it to shed dust and gas due to solar heating. Between October 30 and November 6, Europa Clipper will be in position to possibly sample ions from the comet's tail.</p>

<p>Researchers Samuel Grant and Geraint Jones have used their Tailcatcher code to model the paths of solar wind particles and determine the likelihood of them reaching the spacecraft during this period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have virtually no data on the interior of interstellar comets and the star systems that formed them,” said Samuel Grant of the Finnish Meteorological Institute. “Sampling the tail in this way is the closest we can currently get to a direct sample of such an object, and thus a different part of the galaxy.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We study cometary bodies because they act as time capsules, sealing in material from their formation billions of years ago,” Grant added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, making the opportunity to study them particularly valuable for scientists. Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its potential to provide insights into materials from beyond the solar system, as they can carry information about the early solar system's environment.</p>

<p>Previous missions have encountered challenges in collecting data from comets, highlighting the importance of the current alignment for the Europa Clipper mission.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will monitor space weather conditions leading up to the alignment window to assess the feasibility of sampling cometary ions. The operational status of Europa Clipper's instruments will also be critical for the success of this mission.</p>
