      <h2>NASA caught a view of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from Mars</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, captured by various agency robots and probes. The comet, which was first detected in July, has drawn global interest as astronomers have tracked its transformation from an ice ball into a luminous object. NASA had not commented on the comet for over a month due to the recent government shutdown, which fueled speculation about its nature among celebrities and conspiracy theorists. With the shutdown now over, NASA has shared its latest images during a press conference this week.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it offers scientists a rare opportunity to study an ancient interstellar object. NASA officials have emphasized the importance of understanding 3I/ATLAS and its implications for the study of other solar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet passed Mars at a distance of 19 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA utilized the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), MAVEN, and the Perseverance rover to capture images.</li>
    <li>European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter tracked the comet for about a week in October.</li>
    <li>NASA's PUNCH, STEREO, and SOHO missions observed the comet as it passed behind the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023. Over the following months, astronomers tracked its path as it approached the Sun. On October 30, 2023, it made its closest approach to the Sun. Prior to this, it passed by Mars at a distance of 19 million miles. Various NASA missions, including MRO, MAVEN, and Perseverance, captured images of the comet during its journey.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We think the universe is a magical place,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya during the press conference. “We want very much to find signs of life in the universe. But 3I/ATLAS is a comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The images MAVEN captured truly are incredible,” stated Shannon Curry, MAVEN’s principal investigator at the University of Colorado Boulder.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’m really excited about tracking it to the very end,” said Nicky Fox, Associate Administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered. Its study may provide insights into the makeup and history of other solar systems. The recent government shutdown hindered NASA's ability to communicate about the comet, leading to a surge of speculation and theories about its nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its outward journey from the solar system, astronomers will have additional opportunities to study it. The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to be the last observatory able to observe the comet before it fades from view.</p>
