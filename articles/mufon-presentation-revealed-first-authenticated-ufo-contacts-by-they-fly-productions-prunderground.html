      <h2>MUFON Presentation Reveals First Authenticated UFO Contacts</h2>

<p>On January 6, 2026, in Sedona, Arizona, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) presented findings that include the first authenticated UFO contacts, as revealed by UFO expert Michael Horn. The presentation showcased previously unverified photographs and video footage of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that have now been confirmed by independent scientists to be of extraterrestrial origin.</p>

<p>This presentation marks a significant shift in the perception of UFOs, transitioning from a fringe topic to a subject of serious scientific inquiry. With involvement from notable institutions such as NASA, USGS, and IBM, authorities are now examining the implications of this evidence on the ongoing discussions about extraterrestrial life and technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: January 6, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: Sedona, Arizona</li>
    <li>Presenter: Michael Horn, UFO expert with 47 years of research experience</li>
    <li>Evidence includes over 617 UFO photos and an 8mm video</li>
    <li>Photographs taken by Billy Meier, a Swiss man, over 84 years of ongoing contacts</li>
    <li>Independent verification by scientists from NASA, USGS, and others</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>For almost 60 years, MUFON has researched UFO sightings without definitive scientific proof. This changed during Horn's recent presentation, where he revealed authenticated evidence of UFOs. The photographs, taken by Billy Meier, were shown alongside video clips that highlighted predictions made by Meier decades earlier.</p>

<p>Horn detailed how the analysis of these photos revealed unprecedented details confirming their authenticity. The implications of these findings have garnered attention from the scientific community and the public, as well as renewed interest in the ongoing investigation of UFO phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The clear and often close-up photos, including some of multiple craft, represent a small sampling of 617 of Meier’s remaining photos,” Horn stated during the presentation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Horn emphasized, “I have made all the documentation, including over 250 of Meier’s predictions and the UFO evidence, freely available on my blog.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent MUFON presentation contributes to a growing trend of serious discourse around UFOs, which has included military whistleblowers and government hearings in the United States. The involvement of recognized scientific institutions adds credibility to the claims being made and suggests a shift in how such evidence is perceived.</p>

<p>Previous incidents involving UFO sightings have often been met with skepticism, but this latest evidence appears to be changing that narrative, as scientists and authorities begin to take these reports more seriously.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<pAuthorities and researchers continue to investigate the implications of this authenticated evidence. Michael Horn has made documentation available for public review, allowing individuals to assess the findings themselves and contribute to the ongoing conversation about the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>
