      <h2>3I/ATLAS, the third comet from outside the Solar System, arrives close to Earth in 2025</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object detected in the Solar System, will reach its closest proximity to Earth on December 19, 2025. The North American space agency has confirmed that the comet will pass 270 million kilometres from the planet, a distance nearly twice that between Earth and the Sun. This passage follows perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, recorded on October 29, and does not pose any threat to humanity.</p>

<p>Astronomers from various countries are monitoring the event to gather data on the comet's composition and origin from outside our stellar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass 270 million kilometres from Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Initial designation was A11pl3Z; later named C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) and 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Initial observations revealed a coma of gas and dust extending up to 350,000 kilometres.</li>
    <li>The comet's speed exceeds 210,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile first detected comet 3I/ATLAS, initially designating it as A11pl3Z. The following day, analyses confirmed its interstellar nature, leading to its naming as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) and 3I/ATLAS. Initial observations indicated a coma of gas and dust extending up to 350,000 kilometres. On July 21, Hubble images captured the nucleus of the comet at a distance of 445 million kilometres from Earth. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, and is set to pass Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Astronomers are eager to study 3I/ATLAS as it provides a unique opportunity to learn more about interstellar objects,” said a spokesperson from the North American space agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the Solar System, following Oumuamua and Borisov. Its arrival highlights the growing interest and capability of astronomers to detect and study celestial bodies from outside our solar neighbourhood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will continue to monitor it closely, collecting data that may provide insights into its origins and characteristics. Further observations are planned as it passes near Earth in December 2025.</p>
