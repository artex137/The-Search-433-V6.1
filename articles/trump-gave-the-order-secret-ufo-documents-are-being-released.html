      <h2>Trump orders release of classified UFO documents</h2>

<p>On February 20, 2026, U.S. President Donald Trump directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other agencies to release classified files related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and potential extraterrestrial life. This order follows recent comments made by former President Barack Obama about aliens.</p>

<p>Trump's decision highlights a significant shift in the U.S. government's approach to transparency regarding UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities are now tasked with initiating a process for the identification and publication of all relevant information, although specific details about the files to be released remain unclear.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of order: February 20, 2026</li>
    <li>Involved parties: President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth</li>
    <li>Context: Following statements from former President Barack Obama regarding aliens</li>
    <li>Focus: Classified documents on UFOs and extraterrestrial life</li>
    <li>Previous findings: A 2024 Pentagon report found no verified evidence of extraterrestrial life</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 20, 2026, President Trump issued an order to release classified UFO documents. This directive came shortly after Obama made remarks concerning aliens, prompting increased public interest.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has been compiling reports on UFO sightings for several years. In 2024, a report indicated that investigations into these sightings had not confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Trump's order signifies a potential new phase in the U.S. administration's efforts to disclose information on UFOs and UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I have instructed the relevant agencies to begin the process of identifying and publishing all relevant information regarding UFOs,” Trump stated in a post on his social media platform.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this order, the U.S. government had been cautious in its handling of information related to UFOs. The 2024 Pentagon report was part of ongoing efforts to investigate UAP sightings, but it concluded without confirming any extraterrestrial presence.</p>
<p>This recent directive from Trump reflects a growing public curiosity and a push for transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Agencies involved are expected to commence the identification and publication process of classified UFO documents, although specific timelines and details remain undisclosed.</p>
