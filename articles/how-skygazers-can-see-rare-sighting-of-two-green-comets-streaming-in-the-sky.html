      <h2>Skywatchers Can See Two Green Comets in Northern Hemisphere</h2>
<p>Skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere can observe two bright green comets, Comet Lemmon and Comet SWAN, as they streak across the sky this week. Comet SWAN is expected to have its closest approach to Earth on Monday, while Comet Lemmon will follow on Tuesday.</p>

<p>This rare opportunity allows amateur astronomers and enthusiasts to witness two comets simultaneously without special equipment. According to Carson Fuls, director of a sky survey at the University of Arizona, this phenomenon is “rare, but not unprecedented.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet SWAN closest approach: Monday, [exact date not disclosed]</li>
    <li>Comet Lemmon closest approach: Tuesday, [exact date not disclosed]</li>
    <li>Visibility: Just after sunset in the northern sky for Comet Lemmon; southwest for Comet SWAN</li>
    <li>Potential visibility with binoculars through the end of the month</li>
    <li>Comet Lemmon designation: C/2025 A6; discovered in January</li>
    <li>Comet SWAN designation: C/2025 R2; discovered in September</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon was discovered in January by a telescope searching for near-Earth asteroids. Comet SWAN was identified in September by an amateur astronomer using data from a NASA and European Space Agency spacecraft. Both comets are now visible in the night sky, with their closest approaches occurring this week.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Spotting two comets simultaneously without special equipment is rare, but not unprecedented,” said Carson Fuls, director of the University of Arizona-based sky survey that spotted Comet Lemmon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Experts aren’t yet sure how bright they'll remain,” said astronomer Valerie Rapson of the State University of New York at Oneonta.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are ancient remnants from the solar system's formation, heating up as they approach the sun and releasing gases, which give them their green colour. Earlier this year, a green comet broke up during its approach to the sun, disappointing observers. Notable past comets include Tsuchinshan-Atlas in 2024, Neowise in 2020, and Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake in the 1990s.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to observe both comets this week. Astronomers will continue to monitor their brightness and visibility as they travel away from the sun.</p>
