      <h2>New images show an interstellar comet that will soon make its closest approach to Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on March 1, 2024, as new images reveal details about the interstellar object. The comet, which was first discovered in 2019, is currently traveling through the solar system at a speed of 100,000 km/h.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers and space enthusiasts, as it provides a rare opportunity to study an object from outside our solar system. Observatories around the world are preparing to observe the comet during its close approach, which will allow for detailed analysis of its composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Name: 3I ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest Approach Date: March 1, 2024</li>
    <li>Speed: 100,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Discovered: 2019</li>
    <li>Current Location: Near the orbit of Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS was first discovered in 2019. Since then, it has traveled through the solar system, and astronomers have tracked its trajectory. As it approaches Earth, observatories have begun preparing for its closest approach on March 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Recent images of the comet have been released, providing valuable data for scientists studying its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a unique opportunity to observe an object from outside our solar system,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “We encourage the public to look up and enjoy this celestial event.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar comets, making its study particularly important for understanding the formation and evolution of celestial bodies. Previous interstellar comets, such as `Oumuamua, have sparked significant interest in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories worldwide will continue to monitor Comet 3I ATLAS leading up to its closest approach. Scientists will analyze data collected during this time to gain insights into the comet's origins and properties.</p>
