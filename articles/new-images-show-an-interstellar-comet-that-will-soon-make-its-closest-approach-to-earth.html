      <h2>New images show an interstellar comet that will soon make its closest approach to Earth</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer have captured new images of Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest distance to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet, which originated outside of our solar system, was discovered in July 2023 and is only the third interstellar object ever observed in our celestial neighborhood.</p>

<p>This close approach is significant for astronomers, who have directed multiple missions to study the comet. Observations have provided critical insights into its trajectory and composition, particularly from gases that have sublimated during its previous close pass by the sun in October 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will come within <strong>167 million miles (270 million kilometers)</strong> of Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Hubble last observed the comet on <strong>November 30, 2025</strong>, when it was <strong>178 million miles (286 million kilometers)</strong> away.</li>
    <li>The Juice mission observed the comet from about <strong>41 million miles (66 million kilometers)</strong> away at the beginning of November 2025.</li>
    <li>The Juice spacecraft was launched in <strong>April 2023</strong> and is expected to arrive at Jupiter in <strong>July 2031</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits two tails: a plasma tail and a faint dust tail.</li>
    <li>Data from the Juice mission regarding the comet's flyby is expected to arrive on Earth between <strong>February 18 and 20, 2026</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 while traveling through the solar system. Hubble first observed the comet shortly after its discovery, providing detailed imagery of its teardrop shape. The comet made a close pass by the sun in October 2025, which contributed to the sublimation of gases that helped scientists analyze its composition.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2025, Hubble captured a clearer image of the comet, while the Juice mission observed the comet in early November from a distance of 41 million miles. The spacecraft utilized five scientific instruments to study the comet's activity.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches Earth in December, it will not pose any risk, as it will be on the opposite side of the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The newly released image shows a coma surrounding the comet, as well as two tails: a plasma tail and a faint dust tail,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This activity is typical for comets approaching the sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object recorded in the solar system, following previous discoveries. The study of such comets helps scientists understand the origins and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will analyze data from the Juice mission in February 2026, which is expected to include high-resolution images and composition data that could shed light on the comet's origins and characteristics.</p>
