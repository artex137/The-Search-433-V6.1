      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches its closest point to the Sun this Wednesday, the 29th</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its perihelion on October 29, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun, which is approximately 210 million kilometers. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the closest point of 3I/ATLAS to the Sun, affecting its visibility and characteristics. Authorities, including NASA, have been monitoring the comet since its detection in July and will continue to observe it as it passes through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Date:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
  <li><strong>Distance from Sun:</strong> 1.4 astronomical units (210 million kilometers)</li>
  <li><strong>Detection:</strong> Confirmed by NASA in July 2023</li>
  <li><strong>Observations:</strong> Images captured by the Gemini South telescope on August 27</li>
  <li><strong>Trajectory:</strong> Moving toward Mars</li>
  <li><strong>Type:</strong> Third confirmed interstellar object in the solar system</li>
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Fastest recorded among interstellar objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected by NASA in July 2023 while traveling on a hyperbolic trajectory. The comet's characteristics, including its ice and dust composition, were confirmed through observations made by the ATLAS system.</p>
<p>On August 27, the Gemini South telescope in Chile captured detailed images showing the formation of the comet's coma and tail. These images were processed to highlight the comet's movement against a frozen stellar background.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches perihelion on October 29, it is expected to release gas and dust due to solar heating, potentially increasing its brightness in November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The 3I/ATLAS is the oldest observed interstellar object, and its trajectory confirms it originated from outside the solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its detection and characteristics provide valuable insights into the formation of celestial bodies in distant star systems.</p>
<p>The comet's approach allows astronomers to study its composition and behavior as it travels through the solar system, contributing to ongoing research in astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ground and orbital telescopes will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS after its perihelion, focusing on changes in brightness and tail extension. The comet is expected to depart the solar system in the coming months, and no return to the solar system is anticipated.</p>
