      <h2>3I/ATLAS, third interstellar comet, shows cracks under intense solar heat</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of fragmentation due to intense solar heat as it approaches perihelion in 2026. Discovered in 2023 by the ATLAS project, the comet is currently monitored by astronomers from observatories in Hawaii and Chile.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it offers insights into the behavior of interstellar objects under solar influence. The collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) is coordinating monitoring efforts, with recent observations indicating accelerated gas release and cracks in the comet's core.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> 2023 by the ATLAS project</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Agencies:</strong> NASA and ESA</li>
    <li><strong>Observatories Involved:</strong> Hawaii and Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Fragmentation Signs:</strong> Accelerated release of gases and cracks</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Beyond the solar system, possibly outside the Oort cloud</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2023 as part of the ATLAS project. Since then, it has been monitored closely due to its unique trajectory and composition. As the comet approaches perihelion in 2026, observations have intensified, revealing accelerated sublimation of ice and the emergence of jets of gas from its core.</p>
<p>Ongoing data collection includes weekly updates on the comet's brightness and structural integrity, helping scientists understand the effects of thermal and gravitational pressures on interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The accelerated sublimation of ice and the rapid expansion of fissures are critical to understanding the comet's behavior,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are observing variations in brightness and material ejections that will contribute to our models of interstellar dynamics,” noted an astronomer from one of the collaborating observatories.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet observed, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique characteristics and high speed confirm that it does not orbit the Sun, with its region of origin remaining unknown. Previous studies of interstellar objects have highlighted variations in composition and behavior compared to local comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring will continue with increased surveillance from both land and space observatories. Researchers expect partial fragmentation of the comet, and will focus on jets and ejecta to refine their understanding of interstellar dynamics.</p>
