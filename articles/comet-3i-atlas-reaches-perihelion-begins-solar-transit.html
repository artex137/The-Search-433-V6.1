      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion, begins solar transit</h2>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its perihelion on October 30, 2025, as it approaches the Sun during its brief passage through the solar system. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This milestone is significant as it marks the closest point of 3I/ATLAS to the Sun, which will allow scientists to gather critical data on the comet's chemical composition and behavior. Authorities, including NASA and ESA, have initiated a multi-mission observation campaign to monitor the comet and its activity as it interacts with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach distance: 1.4 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun (approximately 130 million miles or 210 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Observation missions involved: Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, SPHEREx, PUNCH, TESS, Psyche, Lucy, Europa Clipper, Perseverance, and Curiosity rovers</li>
    <li>Notable observations: Hydroxyl detected at distances typically insufficient for water vapor release</li>
    <li>Expected visibility from Earth: Mid-November 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 4, 2025, the Psyche spacecraft performed its closest approach to 3I/ATLAS. Subsequently, on October 3, the comet passed near several Martian orbiters, including NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which successfully captured images of the comet's coma. The next notable event is the close approach by ESA's Juice spacecraft on November 4, 2025.</p>

<p>As of late September 2025, 3I/ATLAS has become temporarily unobservable from Earth due to solar glare. However, the comet is still being monitored by a fleet of space missions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is our only opportunity to study this unique interstellar visitor,” the authors of a paper intended for submission to New Astronomy stated, highlighting the importance of the current observation campaign.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its origin from outside the solar system. Previous observations have revealed unexpected activity, including water vapor release at distances from the Sun where such activity is not typical. This makes its study crucial for understanding interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its perihelion passage, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey, passing Jupiter in March 2026 before heading back into interstellar space. Observations will continue as spacecraft gather data on the comet's behavior and composition during this unique event.</p>
