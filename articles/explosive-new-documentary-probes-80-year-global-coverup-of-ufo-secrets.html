      <h2>Explosive new documentary probes '80-year global coverup' of UFO secrets</h2>

<p>Director Dan Farah has unveiled a new documentary titled "The Age of Disclosure," which investigates an alleged 80-year cover-up regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and non-human intelligent life. The film features interviews with 34 senior members of the U.S. government, military, and intelligence community. It is set to be released on November 21, 2023, in select theaters in New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, and will also be available worldwide on Amazon Prime Video.</p>

<p>The documentary matters as it highlights ongoing congressional interest and government efforts to uncover truths about UFOs, often dismissed or classified. Farah asserts that recent whistle-blowers have prompted senior members of Congress and the administration to pursue answers about UFO encounters and their implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: "The Age of Disclosure"</li>
    <li>Director: Dan Farah</li>
    <li>Release date: November 21, 2023</li>
    <li>Locations of release: New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles</li>
    <li>Available on: Amazon Prime Video</li>
    <li>Interviews conducted: 34 senior U.S. officials</li>
    <li>Key interviewee: Secretary of State Marco Rubio</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>For decades, numerous reports of UFO sightings have emerged from military pilots, radar operators, and civilians. Despite these reports, officials have often dismissed or classified the information. In recent years, congressional hearings and government task forces have attempted to address these issues, but clarity remains elusive.</p>
<p>Farah has spent over three years developing "The Age of Disclosure," interviewing officials with direct knowledge of the phenomena. He asserts that the film reveals a secret race among world powers, including the U.S., China, and Russia, to reverse-engineer technology of non-human origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For a very long time, the public, Congress and even the president have been kept out of the loop on this subject,” said Dan Farah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every single person I interviewed made it very clear that it was no longer a question of whether this was a real situation,” Farah added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities, and it's not ours,” said Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come,” remarked Jay Stratton, former director of the UAP Task Force.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary arrives amid renewed interest in UFOs, particularly after congressional hearings in the past few years. The U.S. government has faced mounting pressure from officials and the public to disclose information regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs).</p>
<p>Farah emphasizes the importance of credible on-the-record interviews, particularly in an era where misinformation is prevalent. The film seeks to provide the evidence that many believe is lacking.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the release of "The Age of Disclosure" approaches, further investigations into UAPs are expected from Congress and the administration. Farah anticipates that the documentary will spark discussions about the implications of non-human intelligence and the need for transparency from government officials.</p>
