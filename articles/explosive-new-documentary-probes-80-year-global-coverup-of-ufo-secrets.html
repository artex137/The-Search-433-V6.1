      <h2>Explosive new documentary probes '80-year global coverup' of UFO secrets</h2>

<p>Director and producer Dan Farah has released a new documentary, "The Age of Disclosure," which alleges an 80-year cover-up of non-human intelligent life by the U.S. government. The film features interviews with 34 senior U.S. officials and is set to premiere on November 21, 2023, in select theaters in New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>This documentary aims to shed light on the longstanding mystery surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). According to Farah, the film highlights a secret race among world powers to reverse-engineer technology of non-human origin. The documentary has sparked renewed interest and scrutiny from Congress and the public regarding the government's transparency on UFO-related incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: "The Age of Disclosure"</li>
    <li>Director: Dan Farah</li>
    <li>Number of officials interviewed: 34</li>
    <li>Film release date: November 21, 2023</li>
    <li>Theaters: New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles</li>
    <li>Available for rental on: Amazon Prime Video</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>For decades, military pilots, radar operators, and civilians have reported sightings of strange objects in the sky. Despite numerous congressional hearings and government task forces, clarity on these sightings remains elusive.</p>
<p>In recent years, whistle-blowers have prompted senior members of Congress and the administration to pursue the truth regarding UAPs. This has led to increased scrutiny and calls for greater transparency from government officials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For a very long time, the public, Congress and even the president have been kept out of the loop on this subject,” said Dan Farah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every single person I interviewed made it very clear that it was no longer a question of whether this was a real situation,” said Farah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities, and it's not ours,” said Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come,” said Jay Stratton, former Defense Intelligence Agency official.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary addresses a growing concern regarding UAPs and their potential implications for national security. Previous incidents have raised alarms, including reported encounters with UAPs near nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>Farah emphasizes that the issue has been moved away from presidential oversight, with defense contractors controlling access to information. This has fueled skepticism and demands for accountability from government officials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the documentary approaches its release date, it is expected to reignite discussions in Congress regarding transparency on UFO encounters and government actions. Farah hopes the film will serve as a significant piece of evidence in the ongoing debate about non-human intelligence.</p>
