      <h2>3I/ATLAS: JUICE spacecraft's NavCam spots two tails on interstellar visitor, reveals European Space Agency</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s JUICE spacecraft has captured an image of the interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS using its NavCam, revealing hints of two tails. The image was taken on November 2, 2023, just two days before the comet's closest approach to the Sun on November 4, when it was approximately 66 million kilometers away.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it sheds light on the comet’s activity as it approaches the Sun. Scientists are eager to analyze the full data from JUICE’s five instruments, which is expected to be available in February 2026. The findings could enhance understanding of the comet’s properties, including its size, composition, and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Image capture of comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of image:</strong> November 2, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> November 4, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> Approximately 66 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Data release:</strong> Full dataset expected in February 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments used:</strong> JANUS, MAJIS, UVS, SWI, and PEP</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 3, 2023, JUICE performed a Venus flyby to gain speed for its journey to Jupiter. Following this maneuver, the spacecraft used its NavCam to capture an image of 3I/ATLAS on November 2, 2023. The closest approach to the Sun occurred on November 4, 2023.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approached perihelion in October, its plasma tail grew noticeably longer. This is a typical reaction to solar radiation, which causes ices to sublimate.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Scientists were surprised to see clear signs of activity as the Sun heated it,” said a representative from ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is believed to be a comet, with its closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 2023 and to Jupiter in March 2024. Despite extensive observations from various telescopes, many questions about the comet remain unanswered, particularly regarding its size and composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will analyze the full data from JUICE's instruments when it becomes available in February 2026, which may lead to further insights about 3I/ATLAS.</p>
