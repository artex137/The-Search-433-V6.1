      <h2>Joseph Kosinski says his UFO disclosure film is science fact, not science fiction</h2>

<p>Joseph Kosinski has announced plans for a UFO disclosure-themed film, stating it is “science fact, not science fiction.” The film, developed in collaboration with producer Jerry Bruckheimer, is in the early stages of production after Apple Original Films invested “dozens of millions of dollars” in the project. Kosinski has indicated that the film will explore the topic of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) in a manner similar to the 1976 political thriller “All the President’s Men.”</p>

<p>This project is significant as it reflects a growing mainstream interest in UAPs, previously dismissed as conspiracy theories. Kosinski's film aims to shed light on government involvement in UAP research, a topic that has gained traction following recent congressional hearings and declassified military footage.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Director: Joseph Kosinski</li>
    <li>Producer: Jerry Bruckheimer</li>
    <li>Screenplay: Zach Baylin</li>
    <li>Executive Producer: David Grusch, a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer</li>
    <li>Budget: “Dozens of millions of dollars” from Apple Original Films</li>
    <li>Film concept: A conspiracy thriller about recovering and reverse-engineering crashed UAPs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, David Grusch publicly claimed that the U.S. government had been secretly recovering non-human craft, which sparked renewed interest in UAPs. In the same year, Apple Original Films invested heavily in Kosinski's UFO-themed project. Kosinski has confirmed that he is working closely with experts on the topic to ensure an accurate representation in the film.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Kosinski stated the film is a “very exciting project” that he hopes to complete as soon as possible. He emphasized the importance of the conversations he has had with those involved in UAP research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’ve got something I’m working on with Jerry Bruckheimer about these UAPs, these unidentified aerial phenomena. So we’re working with two people who are at the very center of the topic. So, you know, the conversations with them are just fascinating.” - Joseph Kosinski</blockquote>

<blockquote>“You think it’s science fiction, but I think we’re finding out it’s science facts. So that’s what the film is about, and I think it’s one of those things that everyone will want to go see.” - Joseph Kosinski</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UAPs has transitioned from fringe conspiracy theories to mainstream discussion in recent years. This shift followed the 2017 revelation of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program by the New York Times, which confirmed the government's investigation into UAPs. Subsequent congressional hearings in 2022 and 2023 have further legitimized the discussion, with officials highlighting national security concerns.</p>

<p>David Grusch’s assertions regarding government recovery efforts have intensified public interest, creating a backdrop for Kosinski's film project.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Kosinski and Bruckheimer are working to finalize the film's development, with the screenplay currently being written by Zach Baylin. Further details regarding casting and production timelines have not been disclosed.</p>
