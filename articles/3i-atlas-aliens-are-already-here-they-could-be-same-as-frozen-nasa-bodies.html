      <h2>Aliens on 3I/ATLAS Comet Could Be on Earth, Claims Uri Geller</h2>

<p>Uri Geller has claimed that aliens travelling on the 3I/ATLAS comet could already be on Earth. The comet is set for its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023. Geller, a spoon-bending magician known for his controversial statements, made these claims in an interview with the Daily Star last week.</p>

<p>This assertion has sparked public interest and speculation about the potential implications of extraterrestrial life visiting Earth. Authorities and scientists are monitoring the comet's trajectory, but no official statements have confirmed the existence of aliens associated with it.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth, with the closest approach on December 19, 2023.</li>
  <li>Uri Geller claims to have seen frozen alien bodies in a NASA facility 50 years ago.</li>
  <li>Geller believes these aliens are part of a "Galactic Federation."</li>
  <li>He suggests that extraterrestrials could help humanity avoid self-destruction.</li>
  <li>No scientific evidence has been presented to support Geller's claims.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Uri Geller has made claims regarding aliens on board the 3I/ATLAS comet leading up to its closest approach on December 19, 2023. In an interview last week, Geller recounted experiences from 50 years ago where he allegedly saw frozen alien bodies at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre. He has connected these past sightings with the current approach of the comet.</p>

<p>As the comet nears, Geller has intensified his assertions about the potential for extraterrestrial contact, stating that these beings could arrive with a message of peace.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Galactic Federation is very real and I want to believe that whatever is on board the 3I/ATLAS is part of it,” Geller stated. “Perhaps they are already here – we just don’t know.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If they land on Earth, it’s not going to be like the film Independence Day. I don’t believe they are here on a hateful mission,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Uri Geller has a long history of making controversial statements about extraterrestrial life and paranormal phenomena. His claims regarding alien bodies at NASA have circulated for decades, but have not been substantiated by credible evidence. The 3I/ATLAS comet has drawn attention from both the scientific community and the public as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the 3I/ATLAS comet approaches, scientists will continue to monitor its path and study its composition. No official investigations into Geller's claims have been announced, and the scientific community remains focused on gathering data from the comet.</p>
