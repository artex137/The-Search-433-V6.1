      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Signals a Possible Interstellar Message</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest after reports of a mysterious pulse sequence detected at 1420 MHz. Observations have indicated that this signal matches a Fibonacci-like pattern, leading some experts to suggest it could indicate intelligent design. The object is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery has prompted scientists and authorities to investigate the nature of 3I/ATLAS, as they seek to determine whether it is a natural comet or an artificial craft. Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has proposed that 3I/ATLAS may act as a "mothership" deploying smaller probes, igniting discussions about the implications of such technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected a signal resembling a Fibonacci pattern.</li>
    <li>The signal was transmitted at 1420 MHz, a frequency used by SETI.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 12 miles wide and travels at over 130,000 mph (58 km/s).</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is scheduled for October 29, 2025, at 11:47 UT.</li>
    <li>The object emits four grams of nickel per second but contains no iron.</li>
    <li>NASA discovered 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA announced the discovery of 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025. The object is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system. As it approaches its perihelion on October 29, observatories are actively monitoring its trajectory and composition.</p>
<p>Reports of the mysterious pulse sequence emerged shortly after the object's discovery, capturing the attention of both scientists and the public. Dr. Loeb has been vocal about his theories regarding the object's potential artificial origins, suggesting it could release smaller probes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The pulses are stable and deliberate, unaffected by the object’s rotation,” according to an online X handle that reported the signal detection.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Avi Loeb commented, “Take a vacation before that date,” referring to the close approach of 3I/ATLAS and the potential for unpredictable cosmic events.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, “A zebra is known for its stripes; comets are identified by their tails. 3I/ATLAS does not have one.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussions surrounding 3I/ATLAS have renewed interest in unidentified aerial phenomena and the transparency of the US government regarding such observations. Dr. Loeb criticized officials for their lack of clarity, despite significant funding for defense and research.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have also prompted speculation about alien technology and the nature of cosmic anomalies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, NASA's Psyche and ESA's JUICE spacecraft will gather more data. Observatories will analyze its light spectrum and material composition, aiming to clarify whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural formation or an engineered object.</p>
