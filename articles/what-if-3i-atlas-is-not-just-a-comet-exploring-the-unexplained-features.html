      <h2>What if 3I/ATLAS is not just a comet? Exploring the unexplained features</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed unusual features in comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, as it travels through the solar system. The comet, which is the third known object from another star system, displays atypical speed and path characteristics, prompting closer examination by researchers.</p>

<p>This investigation matters because understanding 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into the formation of planetary systems beyond our own. Various scientific agencies, including NASA, are monitoring the comet's behaviour and composition as it approaches the Sun and Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness change:</strong> Became much brighter and turned blue around October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Notable gases emitted:</strong> Carbon dioxide, cyanide, atomic nickel, cyanogen, and ammonia</li>
    <li><strong>Observation tools:</strong> NASA's STEREO-A, SOHO, GOES-19, Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope</li>
    <li><strong>Next observations:</strong> Scheduled for December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, scientists discovered 3I/ATLAS. As it approached the Sun, the comet exhibited unexpected brightness and a blue glow around October 29, 2025. Researchers have since focused on the comet's unusual speed and composition, which deviates from typical solar system comets.</p>
<p>NASA's spacecraft and telescopes have tracked 3I/ATLAS closely, collecting data on its characteristics and behaviour. Observations are planned for December 2025, which aim to shed light on the comet’s mysteries.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of such chemicals suggests the comet formed far from its original star, in a very cold environment. This makes it very valuable for understanding how other planetary systems form,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is the third known interstellar object, following Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unusual properties have sparked discussions in the scientific community regarding the nature of interstellar objects and their potential implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, with further observations scheduled for December 2025. After its close passes, the comet will head back to interstellar space, providing a unique opportunity to learn about materials from other star systems.</p>
