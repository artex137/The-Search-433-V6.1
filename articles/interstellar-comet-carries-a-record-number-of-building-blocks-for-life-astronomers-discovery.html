      <h2>Interstellar comet carries a record number of building blocks for life: astronomers' discovery</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered a remarkable concentration of methanol and hydrogen cyanide in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, the third such object identified by scientists. This finding, published on the arXiv platform, reveals that 3I/ATLAS contains significantly more of these crucial compounds than any comet in the Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as methanol and hydrogen cyanide are important elements for the formation of life, specifically DNA and RNA. Researchers have noted that the unique chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into the origins of life on Earth and the role interstellar objects may play in delivering essential compounds.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS contains extraordinarily high concentrations of methanol.</li>
    <li>The comet emits about 40 kg of gaseous methanol per second.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS produces between 250 to 500 grams of hydrogen cyanide per second.</li>
    <li>These levels are four times higher than typical figures for Solar System comets.</li>
    <li>This comet is currently leaving the boundaries of our planetary system.</li>
    <li>Nasa has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, not an artificial probe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed as an interstellar object, and researchers have noted its unusual characteristics, including its atypical chemical composition. Observations from the ALMA radio telescope have provided crucial data on the comet's emissions and chemical makeup. As of now, 3I/ATLAS is moving away from the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We were extremely surprised when we found such high concentrations of methanol and hydrogen cyanide in the nucleus and coma of 3I/ATLAS—levels never observed in comets of the Solar System,” researchers stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The new information supports the hypothesis that objects of this type may have delivered the building blocks of life to Earth billions of years ago,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This finding adds to a growing body of research on the potential for interstellar objects to contribute to the emergence of life on Earth. Previous studies have suggested that similar compounds found in comets could have played a role in the development of organic molecules in our planet's early history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gain further insights into its composition and the implications for understanding the origins of life in the Universe. Future observations from telescopes like the James Webb will enhance our knowledge of interstellar objects.</p>
