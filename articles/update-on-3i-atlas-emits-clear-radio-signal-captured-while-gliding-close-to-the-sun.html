      <h2>Update on Comet 3I/ATLAS – Emits Clear Radio Signal, Captured While Gliding Close to the Sun</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected a clear radio signal from comet 3I/ATLAS, which was captured by a telescope in South Africa on October 24, 2025, as it approached the sun. The comet, discovered by the ATLAS system in Chile on July 1, 2025, is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for the space science community because 3I/ATLAS has a unique chemical composition that differs from typical solar system comets. Authorities are now monitoring its chemical activity and water production rate in real-time, which will enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>The radio signal was captured on October 24, 2025, by a telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its closest approach to the sun (perihelion) on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of approximately 60 km/s when outside the sun's influence.</li>
    <li>Scientists date the comet to be around 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass close to Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
    <li>It will leave the region of the giant planets by the early 2030s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile. On October 24, 2025, astronomers in South Africa captured a radio signal from the comet. The comet reached its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is the first time that an interstellar object has left such a clear radio trail,” said a spokesperson from the space science community.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The water activity of comet 3I/ATLAS places it squarely within the realm of natural celestial objects,” noted an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects have been detected: asteroid 1I/’Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its chemical signature, have prompted intrigue about its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are awaiting new spectroscopic observations and high-resolution images from the HiRISE (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) to further investigate comet 3I/ATLAS and its properties.</p>
