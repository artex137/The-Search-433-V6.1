      <h2>NASA Warns: You Need a Telescope to See Comet 3I/ATLAS in December Skies</h2>

<p>The Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles (over 700 times the distance between Earth and the moon). This high-speed interstellar comet is the third object from outside our solar system to be discovered within our solar system.</p>

<p>The rarity of Comet 3I/ATLAS makes it a significant target for scientific study. NASA is actively observing the comet using various spacecraft and telescopes to gather data on its composition and trajectory. The comet is expected to reach a magnitude of 11 to 15 during its closest approach, making it too dim to see with the naked eye and requiring a telescope with a minimum aperture of 30 centimetres for observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>It will be about 170 million miles away during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>Observers can look for it in the pre-dawn hours between 02:00 and 07:00 local time.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be between 320 metres and 5.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>It is only the third interstellar object confirmed to enter our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed as it travels through our solar system. NASA has utilized various telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, to study its characteristics and trajectory.</p>
<p>The comet's closest approach is scheduled for December 19, 2023, which is considered the best opportunity for observation before it exits our solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS poses absolutely no threat to Earth,” NASA has stated, emphasizing its safe distance from our planet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is a unique celestial object, providing a rare opportunity for scientists to study material from outside our solar system. This discovery highlights the importance of ongoing observation of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS until it exits the solar system, gathering as much data as possible to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
