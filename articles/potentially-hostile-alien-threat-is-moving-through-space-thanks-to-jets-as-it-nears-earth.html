      <h2>'Potentially hostile alien threat' is moving through space thanks to 'jets' as it nears Earth</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported that comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth and is expected to complete its closest flyby within days. The comet was discovered in July 2023 and has garnered attention due to its unusual features and a claim by physicist Avi Loeb that it could represent a "potentially hostile alien threat." No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the comet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to enter our solar system. Scientists have been closely monitoring its trajectory and characteristics, aided by images from the Hubble Space Telescope. Authorities are studying its acceleration patterns, which are attributed to non-gravitational forces rather than traditional orbital mechanics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is expected to complete its closest flyby to Earth in the coming days.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be around 375 metres in diameter.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is experiencing a non-gravitational acceleration of approximately half a micron per second squared.</li>
    <li>Observations have been made using the Hubble Space Telescope and other orbiting telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered, marking it as the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. Over the following months, scientists have monitored its trajectory and physical characteristics. Recent studies have focused on its acceleration due to outgassing, as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS nears Earth, researchers have shared updated images and findings, contributing to ongoing discussions about its potential risks and unique features.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The acceleration we are observing is not due to gravitational forces but rather due to the release of material from the comet,” said a representative from the research team monitoring 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects that have entered the solar system. Previous objects, such as 'Oumuamua', have prompted extensive scientific inquiry and speculation regarding their origins and potential implications for Earth. The study of these objects is crucial for understanding the dynamics of our solar system and the materials that exist beyond it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and gather data on its behavior. Further studies will aim to clarify the implications of its non-gravitational acceleration and its potential impact on future interstellar research.</p>
