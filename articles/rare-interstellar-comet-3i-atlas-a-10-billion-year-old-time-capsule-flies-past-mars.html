      <h2>Rare Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Flies Past Mars</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) has passed approximately 30 million kilometers from Mars between October 1 and October 7, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile, it is the third known interstellar object to enter our Solar System, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>This comet is significant because it serves as a unique window into the early universe, potentially offering insights into the conditions that existed before the formation of our Solar System. Authorities, including the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, have mobilized numerous instruments to study 3I/ATLAS as it behaves like a typical comet, venting gas and dust that can be analyzed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile.</li>
    <li>Flyby distance from Mars: Approximately 30 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Speed: About 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size: 5–6 kilometers across.</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>CO₂-to-H₂O ratio: Approximately 8:1.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: Approximately 1.8 AU (270 million kilometers).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected moving through the outer Solar System in June 2025. By July 2025, the Minor Planet Center designated it as the third interstellar object discovered. The comet's trajectory confirmed it was unbound to the Sun, indicating it was on a one-way trip.</p>

<p>In early October 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars, allowing ESA’s ExoMars TGO and Mars Express orbiters to capture images of the comet. The images revealed a faint coma, which was notably dim compared to typical targets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You wait ages for an interstellar comet to arrive and then three come along at once,” said science writer Ian Sample.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Michael Küppers, ESA’s Comet Interceptor project scientist, noted, “These objects are the first building blocks we can observe from [other stellar] systems… They tell us about the conditions in the stellar system where they formed.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the most “comet-like” interstellar visitor to date, exhibiting active venting of gas and dust. Previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, did not display such behavior, making 3I/ATLAS a valuable subject for study. Researchers aim to understand its composition and the implications for planet formation beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its Mars flyby, scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion in late October 2025. ESA’s Juice probe is set to study the comet, providing further insights into its composition and behavior during this active phase.</p>
