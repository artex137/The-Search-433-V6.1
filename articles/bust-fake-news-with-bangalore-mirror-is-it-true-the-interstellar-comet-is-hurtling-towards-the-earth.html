      <h2>Bust Fake News With Bangalore Mirror: Is it true the interstellar comet is hurtling towards the Earth?</h2>

<p>A recent online frenzy has emerged regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which NASA's ATLAS telescope discovered earlier this year. Despite widespread concern, both NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention due to various conspiracy theories circulating on social media, particularly following a September 29 article from the New York Post that suggested the comet could be alien technology. Authorities are working to clarify the facts surrounding 3I/ATLAS to combat misinformation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by NASA’s ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>It was first observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently traveling at almost 210,000 km/h (130,500 mph).</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth occurred on July 21, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers (167.8 million miles).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor to be observed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Following this, on July 21, the comet passed at a safe distance of 270 million kilometers from Earth. The online speculation began on September 29 when the New York Post published an article suggesting the comet could be larger than previously thought and possibly linked to alien technology.</p>
<p>On September 30, U.S. military leaders met, prompting further online theories about the comet's potential threat. Various users on social media began sharing sensational claims about the comet, leading to a significant increase in public concern.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet’s path never came close to Earth or any other planet,” NASA stated in response to the growing concerns.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is not a doomsday threat; it is a one-of-a-kind opportunity for science,” the ESA confirmed.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time that the discovery of a comet has sparked public anxiety. Previous incidents have often led to misinformation regarding potential threats from space objects. The scientific community continues to emphasize the importance of accurate information to counteract sensational claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and provide updates as necessary, ensuring that the public remains informed about the comet's status and any scientific opportunities it presents.</p>
