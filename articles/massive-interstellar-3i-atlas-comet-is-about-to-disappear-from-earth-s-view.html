      <h2>Massive interstellar 3I/Atlas comet is about to disappear from Earth's view</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/Atlas, the third discovered interstellar visitor to our solar system, will soon become too close to the Sun to be observed from Earth. The comet was first detected by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile on July 1. Astronomers have been studying the comet since its discovery, but it is expected to dip behind the Sun's glare this week.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers as it limits ground-based observations of the comet until its reappearance in early December. During this period, NASA and other space agencies, including the European Space Agency (ESA), will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas using spacecraft far from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was observed for the first time on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, at a distance of about 209 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to weigh about 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is 3 to 5 times larger than previous interstellar objects 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and other spacecraft are tracking the comet during its time out of view.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile detected comet 3I/Atlas. Since then, astronomers have conducted more than 4,000 observations to study its characteristics. The comet will be visible to ground-based observatories until the end of September 2023, after which it will be obscured by the Sun. It is set to make its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2023, before reappearing for further observations in early December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, Baird Professor of Science and Institute director at Harvard University, stated, "Is 3I/ATLAS an unusually massive comet with an unusual chemical composition on an unusually rare trajectory or alien technology?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also remarked, "We should not decide about the nature of 3I/ATLAS based on the chemical composition of its skin, for the same reason that we should not judge a book by its cover."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object tracked through our solar system, following 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its discovery adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar objects and their properties. Previous studies have indicated that these objects may have unique chemical compositions, which contribute to ongoing discussions in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/Atlas moves out of view, NASA and ESA will continue to gather data using spacecraft. Anticipated observations from NASA’s HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in October and from NASA’s Juno spacecraft in March 2026 may provide insights into the comet’s unusual characteristics.</p>
