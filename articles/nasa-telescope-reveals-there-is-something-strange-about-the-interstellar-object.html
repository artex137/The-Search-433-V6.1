      <h2>Nasa telescope reveals strange characteristics of comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA’s James Webb Telescope has identified unusual features of the interstellar object known as comet 3I/ATLAS, which is travelling at speeds exceeding 210,000 kilometres per hour. The comet is on a flat and straight trajectory, according to observations reported by Live Science.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS has one of the highest ratios of carbon dioxide (CO2) to water (H2O) recorded for a comet. If confirmed, this finding could indicate that the comet has "mysterious origins" beyond our solar system, researchers have stated.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is travelling at speeds over <strong>210,000 km/h</strong>.</li>
  <li>The object is estimated to be <strong>3.5 miles</strong> in diameter.</li>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is believed to be approximately <strong>3 billion years old</strong>.</li>
  <li>It was first discovered in <strong>July 2023</strong> by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile.</li>
  <li>This is only the <strong>third time</strong> an object has been observed entering our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, the ATLAS telescope in Chile first detected comet 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Since then, astronomers have conducted further observations using the James Webb Telescope and have noted its unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>Recent studies have indicated that the comet has a high CO2 to H2O ratio, suggesting it may have formed in conditions different from those of Solar System comets. Researchers are currently analyzing data to understand more about its origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No one knows where the comet came from,” said David Jewitt, an astronomer at UCLA and science team leader for the Hubble observations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It’s like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second. You can’t project that back with any accuracy to figure out where it started on its path,” Jewitt added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Alternatively, 3I/ATLAS could be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy, and the dust emitted from its frontal surface might be from dirt that accumulated on its surface during its interstellar travel,” said Professor Dr Avi Loeb, a Harvard physicist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its speed and trajectory but also for the ongoing debate surrounding its origins. Previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, have raised similar questions about extraterrestrial life and the nature of objects entering our solar system.</p>

<p>The high CO2 to H2O ratio observed in 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into the conditions in which it formed, possibly shedding light on the early solar system and its formation processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further observations are expected to clarify its composition and trajectory, as well as the validity of claims regarding its potential as an artificial object.</p>
