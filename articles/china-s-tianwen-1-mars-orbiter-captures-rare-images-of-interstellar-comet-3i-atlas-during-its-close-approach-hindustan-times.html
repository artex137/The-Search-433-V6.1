      <h2>China’s Tianwen 1 Mars orbiter captures rare images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its close approach</h2>

<p>China’s Tianwen 1 spacecraft has captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed near Mars between October 1 and October 4, 2023. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) released the images this week, marking a significant event in the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>This observation matters as it contributes to the growing record of material originating outside our solar system. According to CNSA, the capture of 3I/ATLAS provides crucial data that can enhance understanding of the comet’s composition and trajectory. Various agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency, have coordinated efforts to gather data on the comet during its close approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 5.6 kilometers wide.</li>
    <li>The comet was traveling at about 129,800 mph (58 km/s).</li>
    <li>Images were taken by Tianwen 1 between October 1 and October 4, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was located tens of millions of kilometers from Tianwen 1 during its observation.</li>
    <li>Tianwen 1 has been active since its launch in 2020 and entered Mars orbit in February 2021.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 1-4, 2023, Tianwen 1 captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its close pass by Mars. The CNSA reported that the orbiter used its High-Resolution Imaging Camera (HiRIC) to track the comet's motion.</p>
<p>Prior to this observation, astronomers had confirmed only two other interstellar objects: ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. This highlights the rarity of such events.</p>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency repositioned their Mars orbiters and surface instruments to collect data on 3I/ATLAS as it approached the planet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The processed data shows a nucleus and a surrounding coma, which spans several thousand kilometers,” CNSA stated. “This operation serves as a technical extension of the mission, testing Tianwen 1’s capabilities beyond standard Mars imaging.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects are extremely rare, and only three have been confirmed to date. The observations of 3I/ATLAS add valuable information to the scientific understanding of such objects and their origins.</p>
<p>Tianwen 1 continues to operate around Mars, while the rover Zhurong, which landed in Utopia Planitia, is currently inactive after approximately 12 months of operation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>CNSA plans to utilize the experience gained from imaging 3I/ATLAS to inform future missions, including Tianwen 2, which launched in May 2023 and aims to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid.</p>
