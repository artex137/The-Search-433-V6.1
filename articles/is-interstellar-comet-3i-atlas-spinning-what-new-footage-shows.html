      <h2>Is Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Spinning? What New Footage Shows</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn attention as new amateur videos suggest it may be spinning. The footage has surfaced ahead of a live event from NASA scheduled for 3 PM EST on Wednesday, where new images of the comet are expected to be revealed.</p>

<p>This development is significant because it raises questions about the comet's characteristics and composition. NASA and other space agencies continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Observers are eager for official confirmation regarding the potential spinning motion of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at speeds exceeding <strong>210,000 kilometres per hour</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun in late October, passing <strong>29 million kilometres</strong> from Mars.</li>
    <li>New footage was shared by amateur astronomer Ray's Astrophotography at <strong>9 PM EST</strong>.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft is observing 3I/ATLAS until November 25.</li>
    <li>Scientific results from these observations are expected early next year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, as part of the University of Hawaii’s program. It is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. In late October 2025, the comet made its closest approach to the Sun, passing approximately 29 million kilometres from Mars. Observations from NASA's spacecraft orbiting Mars began, although no spinning motion has been confirmed yet. On November 24, 2025, amateur videos suggesting a spinning structure were shared online.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new footage clearly shows a spinning structure, similar to what was captured by ESA’s ExoMars Orbiter,” said Ray from Ray's Astrophotography.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We should wait for official scientific analysis to confirm these features,” astronomers cautioned regarding the circulating claims about the comet's motion.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant because it appears to be rich in carbon dioxide, a feature common in comets from distant star systems. Studying this comet offers scientists a unique opportunity to learn about material from outside our solar system and gain insights into the formation of other planetary systems. Previous interstellar objects include 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to release new images of 3I/ATLAS during the live event on Wednesday. Observers are keen to see if these images confirm the spinning motion suggested by recent footage.</p>
