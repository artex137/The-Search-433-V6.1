      <h2>Did Aliens Watch Our Nuclear Tests? Scientist Links 100,000 UFOs to Atomic Blasts in Chilling Report</h2>

<p>A study by Swedish astrophysicist Dr. Beatriz Villarroel has prompted viral claims that aliens monitored Cold War nuclear tests. The report, which focuses on the investigation of vanishing stars, has sparked renewed interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) as it circulates online.</p>

<p>The VASCO Project, led by Dr. Villarroel at Stockholm University and the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics, examines historical images of the sky. While the report identified nine light sources that disappeared between the 1950s and today, it does not mention extraterrestrial involvement. Experts have cautioned that misinterpretations of the data may contribute to the spread of UFO folklore.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Over 100,000 archival sky plates have been scanned.</li>
    <li>The claim of '100,000 UFOs' refers to images reviewed, not objects detected.</li>
    <li>The identified disappearances are likely due to instrument artefacts or brief flares.</li>
    <li>Dr. Villarroel emphasizes the need for careful study before extraordinary interpretations.</li>
    <li>Her findings resurfaced online in October 2025 amid misrepresentations of her work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2021, Dr. Villarroel and her team reported nine transient light sources identified on 1952 Palomar plates that later vanished. They attributed these disappearances to potential natural or technical causes, including instrumental artefacts.</p>

<p>In October 2025, social media accounts misrepresented her research, claiming she had recorded '100,000 UFOs.' The actual number pertains to the extensive review of sky images, not unidentified flying objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We must study each case carefully before any extraordinary interpretation,” Villarroel stated in her 2021 paper.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The VASCO Project is part of a broader scientific effort to analyze historical astronomical data for unexplained transients. The project employs artificial intelligence tools to filter out false positives and encourages amateur astronomers to assist in confirming genuine events. Despite the viral narrative, there is no peer-reviewed evidence linking Villarroel's findings to nuclear testing.</p>

<p>Experts have warned against conflating astrophysics with Cold War conspiracies, stating that historical UFO cases are often grounded in classified aircraft tests.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Dr. Villarroel’s research aims to uncover rare cosmic phenomena and improve methods for detecting transient astrophysical events. The project continues to invite further investigation and collaboration from the scientific community and amateur astronomers.</p>
