      <h2>China’s Tianwen-1 probe photographs interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on unprecedented approach to Mars</h2>

<p>The Chinese probe Tianwen-1 has captured high-resolution images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from its orbit around Mars in October 2025. This marks the first time an interstellar object has been photographed from another planet, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA).</p>

<p>This achievement represents a significant milestone in planetary science and astronomy. The data collected by Tianwen-1 will aid the global scientific community in studying the composition and trajectory of objects originating outside the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> Approximately 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter of comet 3I/ATLAS:</strong> About 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Speed of comet:</strong> 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Comet trajectory:</strong> Sharp hyperbolic orbit</li>
    <li><strong>Coma diameter:</strong> Thousands of kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Tail length:</strong> Approximately 56,000 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Tianwen-1 probe has been operational since it entered Mars' orbit in February 2021. The mission, which includes an orbiter, lander, and rover, has focused on mapping the Martian surface and conducting scientific analysis. In October 2025, the probe successfully observed and photographed comet 3I/ATLAS during its approach to Mars.</p>
<p>The high-resolution imaging was facilitated by the HiRIC (High Resolution Imaging Camera) onboard Tianwen-1, which was originally designed for mapping Mars. The engineering team adapted the camera for tracking the fast-moving comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observation of comet 3I/ATLAS represents a leap forward in our understanding of interstellar objects,” said a spokesperson from the CNSA. “The data we have gathered will be invaluable for future studies.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following the detection of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The unique trajectory of 3I/ATLAS, characterized by its hyperbolic orbit, indicates that it is passing through the Solar System rather than originating from it. The study of such comets provides insights into the formation of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing analysis of the data collected from the images is expected to continue. Scientists aim to further understand the chemical and physical composition of 3I/ATLAS, with preliminary analyses suggesting the presence of water ice and carbon dioxide. NASA, ESA, and other agencies will continue collaborating to enhance the scientific understanding of this rare cosmic visitor.</p>
