      <h2>3I/ATLAS Asteroid Not Alien? Michio Kaku Shuts Down Avi Loeb's Alien Claims</h2>

<p>The asteroid 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), has sparked debate over its origins, with theoretical physicist Michio Kaku disputing claims made by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb that it could be an alien probe. Kaku has stated that the evidence suggests 3I/ATLAS is likely a natural object rather than a technological one.</p>

<p>The debate over 3I/ATLAS is significant as it highlights the importance of scientific scrutiny in interpreting astronomical phenomena. Authorities and scientists are continuing to analyze the asteroid as it approaches its closest pass to the Sun, or perihelion, on 29 October 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>First observed by the ATLAS survey.</li>
    <li>Perihelion date is 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Travels at approximately 58 kilometres per second.</li>
    <li>Inclined about five degrees to the ecliptic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey. Early observations noted the object’s lack of a distinct comet-like tail, raising questions about its nature. On 21 July 2025, a Hubble image captured a faint glow, contradicting typical cometary features. In the following months, as the asteroid approaches perihelion, astronomers will monitor changes in brightness and dust emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a very old object, perhaps 7 billion years old, and in 7 billion years, there's been plenty of time to accumulate garbage,” said Michio Kaku, emphasizing the likelihood of a natural origin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“All evidence points to this being an ordinary comet rather than a spacecraft,” stated NASA, reinforcing the consensus among space agencies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS is not new; claims of extraterrestrial origins for celestial objects often surface, but they require substantial evidence to gain acceptance in the scientific community. Many scientists argue that extraordinary claims necessitate extraordinary evidence, and the absence of propulsion signatures or radio emissions in the case of 3I/ATLAS weakens Loeb's hypothesis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS nears its perihelion on 29 October 2025, astronomers will closely observe its behaviour. If it demonstrates typical cometary activity, such as outgassing and dust shedding, it will support the theory of a natural origin. Any anomalies, however, could reignite discussions regarding its origins.</p>
