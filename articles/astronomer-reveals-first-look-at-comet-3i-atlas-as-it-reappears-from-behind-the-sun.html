      <h2>Astronomer reveals first look at Comet 3I/ATLAS as it reappears from behind the sun</h2>

<p>An astronomer has captured images of Comet 3I/ATLAS using the Lowell Observatory's Discovery Telescope in Arizona, marking the first optical observations of the comet since it disappeared behind the sun. Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at the observatory, took the photos on Halloween, October 31, 2023. The comet is now visible to amateur astronomers across much of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insights into the comet's activity after it reached perihelion on October 29, when it came within 1.4 astronomical units (130 million miles or 210 million kilometers) of the sun. Zhang noted that the comet could continue to brighten as it moves away from the sun, offering researchers a chance to learn more about its composition during this period.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed on October 31, 2023.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at speeds over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>The comet is now visible from the Northern Hemisphere using standard amateur telescopes.</li>
    <li>Qicheng Zhang captured images when the comet was approximately 16 degrees from the sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third recorded interstellar object, was discovered in July 2020. The comet moved into the sun's shadow, reaching perihelion on October 29, 2023. On October 31, astronomer Qicheng Zhang captured the first optical images of the comet since its perihelion, using both the Discovery Telescope and a smaller telescope.</p>

<p>On October 28, Zhang and a colleague published a study indicating that the comet underwent rapid brightening and exhibited a bluer hue prior to perihelion. This suggests that gas emissions contributed significantly to its visible brightness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All you need is a clear sky and a very low eastern horizon,” Zhang said. “It won’t look very impressive, it’s just a smudge, but it will be an increasingly visible smudge over the next few days.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The comet is rapidly rising from the sun,” Zhang added. “I think in one week it’s going to be something like 25 or 30 degrees away from the sun, by which point there will be a large number of other big telescopes around the world that will also be able to start to follow it up.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of only three interstellar objects recorded to date. Its trajectory through the solar system has provided scientists with valuable data about its composition and behavior. Preliminary research suggests that prolonged exposure to space radiation may have altered the comet's surface, complicating efforts to determine its origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues to rise in the sky, astronomers expect increased visibility and activity. Researchers will likely conduct further observations to study the comet's characteristics and behavior in the coming weeks.</p>
