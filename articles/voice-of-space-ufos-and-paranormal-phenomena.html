      <h2>Voice of Space: UFOs and Paranormal Phenomena Exhibition Opens at The Drawing Center</h2>

<p>The exhibition "Voice of Space: UFOs and Paranormal Phenomena" has opened at The Drawing Center in New York, showcasing nearly forty works that explore the psychological and cultural significance of UFOs. The exhibition, curated by Olivia Shao, aims to offer a new perspective on the phenomenon, which has intrigued humanity for decades.</p>

<p>This exhibition matters as it challenges the conventional understanding of UFOs, suggesting they represent more than just unexplained sightings. According to Shao, the works included reflect humanity's search for meaning and stability amid modern chaos. The exhibition seeks to explore the intersection of collective anxiety, spiritual longing, and speculative belief, urging viewers to reconsider their perceptions of the unknown.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1959, Carl Jung published a treatise discussing the psychological reality of flying saucers, proposing that these sightings reflected humanity's quest for understanding in a chaotic world. The current exhibition at The Drawing Center builds upon this idea, presenting works that serve as vessels for psychological projection rather than literal spacecraft.</p>

<p>Opening the exhibition is Alexandru Chira’s "Installation for Invoking Rain and Rainbow - Colorful Project," which sets the tone for the blend of rationality and mysticism present throughout the works. Other notable pieces include Howardena Pindell’s "Astronomy: Northern Hemisphere" and Stephen Willats’s "Travelling with the Good Connector," which illustrate the complex relationship between empirical investigation and metaphysical exploration.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We must understand UFOs not just as a material phenomenon but as a reflection of our collective psyche,” said curator Olivia Shao.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The exhibition challenges viewers to consider how our beliefs and fears shape our understanding of the cosmos,” Shao added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The fascination with UFOs dates back decades, with cultural references appearing in literature, film, and art. Carl Jung's 1959 treatise remains a significant touchstone, suggesting that these phenomena are tied to deeper psychological needs. The exhibition aims to expand this conversation by including works that blend scientific inquiry with mystical interpretation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The exhibition is set to run for an undisclosed period. Curator Olivia Shao plans to host discussions and events to further explore the themes presented in the exhibition, engaging the public in dialogues about the intersections of belief, perception, and the unknown.</p>
