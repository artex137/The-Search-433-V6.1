      <h2>NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet after weeks of speculation</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, ending weeks of speculation about its origins. The comet was first observed on July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile, as it sped through our solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with its passage.</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it clarifies misconceptions surrounding 3I/ATLAS, which some speculated could be an artificial object. NASA officials have assured the public that the comet poses no threat to Earth, as it will be approximately 1.8 astronomical units (AU) away during its closest approach, nearly twice the distance between Earth and the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA used over 20 telescopes and spacecraft to study the object.</li>
    <li>The comet is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass about 1.8 AU from Earth.</li>
    <li>Scientists have detected unusual gases, including carbon dioxide and nickel vapour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, NASA engaged in extensive observations using over 20 telescopes and spacecraft to analyze the comet's characteristics. On a recent briefing, NASA officials confirmed its status as a natural comet and dismissed theories suggesting it was artificial.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This object is a comet … it looks and behaves like a comet,” said Amit Kshatriya from NASA.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There are no signs of technology, no signals, and nothing that would suggest it was made by intelligent life,” added Nicky Fox, another NASA scientist.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Knowing this comet may contain material from before our Sun was even born gives me goosebumps,” commented NASA scientist Tom Statler.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The confirmation of 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet is notable within the context of interstellar objects. It joins the ranks of other known interstellar visitors, contributing to our understanding of celestial bodies from beyond our solar system. Previous instances have sparked similar public interest and speculation, often leading to theories about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches, utilizing powerful telescopes like Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope to gather more data about its composition and origins.</p>
