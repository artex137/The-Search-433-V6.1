      <h2>The Remarkable Large-Scale Structure of Anti-Tail and Tail Jets from 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Researchers have reported a significant image of the interstellar object **3I/ATLAS**, showcasing its large-scale jet structures. The image was captured by Frank Niebling and Michael Buchner using two telescopes between **5:08 and 5:22 UT** on **November 9, 2029**. The findings reveal two anti-tail jets extending towards the Sun and a longer tail jet moving away from it.</p>

<p>This discovery is important for future astronomical observations, as it provides a unique target for the **Hubble** and **James Webb** telescopes. 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on **December 19, 2025**, at a distance of **269 million kilometers**. The scale of the jets is significantly larger than previously observed, raising questions about their origins and implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently **326 million kilometers** from Earth.</li>
    <li>Jets extend **10 arcminutes** sunward and **30 arcminutes** outward.</li>
    <li>Tail jet is **2.85 million kilometers** long; anti-tail jets are **0.95 million kilometers** long.</li>
    <li>The mass loss rate is estimated at **50 billion tons per month**.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be at its closest approach on **December 19, 2025**.</li>
    <li>Closest distance during approach will be **269 million kilometers**.</li>
    <li>NASA’s **Juno** spacecraft will encounter 3I/ATLAS on **March 16, 2026**, from **53 million kilometers** away.</li>
    <li>ESA’s **Juice** spacecraft is currently **64 million kilometers** from 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On **July 21, 2025**, initial observations of 3I/ATLAS were made using the **Hubble Space Telescope**, noting its glowing halo. The recent image captured on **November 9, 2029**, revealed the extensive jet structures. The next significant event will occur on **December 19, 2025**, when 3I/ATLAS reaches its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>Following this, the **Juno** spacecraft will conduct its flyby on **March 16, 2026**, allowing for further investigation of the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The multi-jet structure constitutes a remarkable target for future observations,” said Frank Niebling, highlighting the potential for further astronomical study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed, following **1I/`Oumuamua** and another unnamed object. The mass of 3I/ATLAS is significantly larger, estimated at **50 billion tons**, compared to **1I/`Oumuamua**, which raises questions about the frequency and size of interstellar objects entering the solar system. The rarity of such large objects has been noted, with expectations of their occurrence estimated at once every **10,000 years**.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Upcoming spectroscopic observations will aim to determine the velocity, mass flux, and composition of the jets from 3I/ATLAS. These results will help clarify the origins of the object and whether it is of natural or technological origin.</p>
