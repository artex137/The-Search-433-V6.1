      <h2>UFO Disclosure? Karoline Leavitt Quashes Rumors of Donald Trump’s Extraterrestrial Speech</h2>

<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed speculation regarding a potential speech by President Donald Trump on extraterrestrial life during a briefing on Wednesday, February 18, 2026, in Washington, D.C. Leavitt’s comments came after a reporter questioned whether such a speech exists, prompting laughter from the press corps.</p>

<p>This exchange highlights the ongoing public interest in UFOs and government transparency regarding extraterrestrial matters. Leavitt's remarks reflect the administration's stance as it navigates between public curiosity and official denials about potential government knowledge of alien life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: February 18, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: White House, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Press Secretary: Karoline Leavitt</li>
    <li>Key claim: Lara Trump stated that a speech on aliens exists and is prepared.</li>
    <li>Context: Former President Barack Obama confirmed that aliens are "real" during a podcast.</li>
    <li>Public opinion: A 2025 poll indicated nearly half of Americans believe the government is hiding evidence of UFOs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2026, former President Barack Obama commented on a podcast that aliens are "real," igniting widespread speculation.</p>
<p>Following Obama’s remarks, Lara Trump claimed to a columnist that President Trump has a prepared speech on extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>During a press briefing on February 18, 2026, Karoline Leavitt was asked about the existence of this speech, leading to her surprised response.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Well, a speech on aliens would be news to me,” Leavitt said. “That sounds very exciting, though. I’ll have to check in with our speechwriting team.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That would be of great interest to me personally, and I’m sure all of you in this room,” Leavitt added, addressing the press corps.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent discussion around UFOs has gained momentum, particularly following public hearings in 2024 where former intelligence officials testified about alleged secret recovery programs for non-human craft. These events have intensified public interest and speculation about government knowledge of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Area 51 has long been a focal point of mistrust, with decades of government denial about its activities fueling conspiracy theories about hidden alien technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The White House has not disclosed any further information regarding the existence of a speech on extraterrestrial life. Future statements from the administration may address ongoing public interest in UFOs and government transparency.
