      <h2>October 29: The day of reckoning for 3I/ATLAS - Scientist warns of historic shift</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb has announced that October 29 marks a significant date for interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which will move behind the Sun, potentially altering its trajectory towards Earth. Loeb, a Harvard scientist, has raised concerns, suggesting that the object could be more than just a comet, possibly an "alien mothership" targeting not only Earth but also other planets in the solar system.</p>

<p>This situation is critical as authorities and scientists monitor 3I/ATLAS closely. Its trajectory currently poses no immediate threat to Earth; however, Loeb warns that changes could occur after October 29, leading to a new trajectory that might bring it closer to our planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of significance:</strong> October 29</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> October 3</li>
    <li><strong>Expected speed:</strong> 200,000 km/h (60,000 km/s)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated mass:</strong> Over 33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>Projected diameter of nucleus:</strong> Greater than 5 kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Reappearance:</strong> Early December</li>
    <li><strong>Closest distance to Earth:</strong> 273 million kilometres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Mars on October 3. Following this, it will move behind the Sun, rendering it invisible from Earth. This period is crucial as it may allow the object to alter its trajectory using the Sun's gravity. Loeb has indicated that significant changes may occur after October 29, despite the current trajectory posing no risk to Earth.</p>

<p>In early December, 3I/ATLAS is expected to reappear after being hidden from view by the Sun's glare.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "If it is a piece of alien technology coming with the intention to probe us, it might use the hideout time to implement its plan and swing towards Earth." </blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further emphasized, "The chances of it being a natural object are tiny because, before finding such a huge interstellar object, we should have found thousands of much smaller space rocks."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest within the astronomical community. While most scientists classify it as a comet, Loeb's claims suggest unusual attributes that could indicate it is an artificial object. The lack of a cometary tail until recently and the peculiar trajectory have led to debates about its true nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists and government agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely as it approaches its critical date. Preparations are underway to assess any potential changes in its trajectory after October 29.</p>
