      <h2>Obama Walks Back ‘Aliens Are Real’ Statement on Podcast</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has clarified his comments about extraterrestrial life made during an appearance on Bryan Tyler Cohen's podcast on February 14, 2023. In the podcast, Obama stated, "They’re real but I haven’t seen them," leading to various interpretations regarding his beliefs on the existence of aliens.</p>

<p>Obama's initial remarks have sparked discussions about UFOs and the government's stance on extraterrestrial life. Following the release of the podcast, he took to Instagram on February 15 to provide further context, emphasizing that his belief in aliens is based on statistical probabilities rather than personal experience.</p>
