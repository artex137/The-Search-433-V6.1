      <h2>Declassified Video Shows US Trying to Shoot Down UFO</h2>

<p>A missile reportedly struck a mysterious orb off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024, as captured in video footage presented during a congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) on Tuesday. The incident involved an MQ-9 Reaper drone tracking the object before a second drone fired a Hellfire missile, sending fragments tumbling around it. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The video is now undergoing independent review, according to Republican Congressman <strong>Eric Burlison</strong> of Missouri, who stated the footage came from a whistleblower. This hearing, titled "Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection," highlights concerns over national security implications related to UAPs, also referred to as UFOs. Lawmakers argue that decades of secrecy have hindered public understanding of issues that could impact both science and security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on October 30, 2024.</li>
    <li>The video was presented at a hearing on UAPs.</li>
    <li>The MQ-9 Reaper drone tracked the orb during the missile strike.</li>
    <li>Footage shows the orb deforming and releasing smaller fragments.</li>
    <li>Independent review of the video is ongoing.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon reported 510 UAP incidents, with only 21 requiring further analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone captured video footage of a high-speed object, presumed to be a missile, hitting a mysterious orb off the coast of Yemen. This incident was later presented during a congressional hearing on UAPs.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Congressman Eric Burlison revealed the video had come from a whistleblower and stated that it is currently undergoing independent review. Burlison also shared the footage publicly on X.</p>

<p>Testimony from U.S. Air Force veteran <strong>Dylan Borland</strong> added context, recounting a prior UAP sighting in 2012 at Langley Air Force Base.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’m not going to speculate what it is, but the question is why are we being blocked from this information?” - Eric Burlison, Republican Congressman</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I don’t really know what is true, I don’t know, on this subject, but I do know when we’re being lied to and we are definitely being lied to, there’s just no doubt about that.” - Jared Moskowitz, Democratic Representative</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The craft interfered with my telephone, did not have any sound, and the material it was made of appeared fluid or dynamic.” - Dylan Borland, U.S. Air Force veteran</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon's November 2024 report on UAPs indicated that many sightings are misidentified objects, such as balloons, birds, or drones. Of 510 reported incidents, only 21 warranted further analysis. The Defense Department's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has found no evidence of extraterrestrial technology or advanced foreign capabilities.</p>

<p>Lawmakers have expressed concerns about UAPs as a potential national security issue, particularly with rising military tensions in Yemen following Houthi rebel attacks on commercial ships.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers have emphasized the need for transparency and further investigation into UAPs. The ongoing review of the Yemen video and other whistleblower reports will play a significant role in shaping congressional oversight and public disclosure efforts regarding UAPs.</p>
