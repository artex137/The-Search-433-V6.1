      <h2>Hawaii Telescope Captured Earliest Spectrum of 3I/ATLAS 12.5 Hours After Discovery</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers in Hawaii has captured the earliest spectrum of comet 3I/ATLAS, only **12.5 hours** after its discovery. The object was detected moving through our solar system, and it is the third interstellar object ever identified. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this discovery.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to change our understanding of planet formation. Researchers are now analyzing the data collected from this comet to gain insights into the building blocks of other solar systems. This opportunity is rare and could provide valuable information about the origins of our own solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Time of spectrum capture: **~12.5 hours** after discovery</li>
    <li>Telescope used: University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope</li>
    <li>Key elements detected: Nickel (Ni) and Cyanogen (CN)</li>
    <li>Pre-perihelion approach range: **4.4 - 2.5 astronomical units (au)**</li>
    <li>Wavelength of spectral observations: **< 3800 A**</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered recently, prompting an immediate response from the global scientific community. Astronomers quickly mobilized to gather data from the object as it sped through space.</p>
<p>Within **12.5 hours** of its detection, researchers used the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph on the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope to capture its earliest spectrum. The analysis confirmed cometary activity and revealed the presence of Nickel and Cyanogen.</p>
<p>The ongoing observations will continue to provide insights as the comet approaches perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The ongoing post-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS will provide further insight into its potentially extreme composition,” a member of the research team stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following 'Oumuamua and 'Borisov'. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS exhibits active cometary behaviour, shedding material as it heats up. This makes it a unique subject of study in understanding the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The international team of researchers plans to conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS to analyze its composition and behaviour as it continues its journey through the solar system. This ongoing research may lead to significant revelations about the origins of planetary systems, including our own.</p>
