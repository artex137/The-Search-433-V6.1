      <h2>Interstellar Visitor 3I/Atlas Makes Surprise Appearance in NASA’s Punch Observations</h2>

<p>NASA's Punch mission has recorded the unexpected appearance of interstellar visitor 3I/Atlas, during its monitoring of Comet C/2025 R2 (Swan) in space. The sighting occurred near the end of the monitoring timeline, which lasted nearly 40 days and provided high-frequency images of the comet every four minutes.</p>

<p>This observation is significant for scientists studying comet behavior and the dynamics of interstellar objects. The mission team has explained that the data set now offers an opportunity to compare the rapid changes of Comet Swan with the swift passage of 3I/Atlas, enhancing the understanding of how different celestial bodies interact with the solar environment.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation period: Nearly 40 days</li>
    <li>Imaging frequency: Every four minutes</li>
    <li>Comet Swan's discovery: By amateur astronomer Vladimir Bezugly</li>
    <li>Closest approach of Comet Swan to the Sun: One day after its discovery</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Punch mission began monitoring Comet Swan as it approached the Sun. Images captured during this period showed the comet's coma growing brighter and changing shape, indicating active outgassing from the nucleus. Near the end of the observation timeline, 3I/Atlas entered the frame, moving quickly beneath Comet Swan.</p>

<p>Scientists noted that the appearance of 3I/Atlas was a coincidence of timing, allowing for a unique comparison between the behavior of an interstellar object and a solar system comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects pass quickly, and capturing one in routine imaging is rare,” said a mission scientist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The sighting added context to the dataset and helped show how different bodies react to the solar environment,” another team member explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Punch mission’s observations are considered among the most frequent ever collected for a comet. Scientists have linked the changes observed in Comet Swan to its reaction to solar energy, which causes ice to turn into gas and creates the tail of the comet.</p>

<p>Previous studies of comets have focused on their behavior as they approach the Sun, but the appearance of 3I/Atlas provides a new angle on how interstellar objects behave in similar conditions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The mission team will continue to analyze the collected data, focusing on the implications of the findings regarding interstellar objects and their interactions with solar system bodies.</p>
