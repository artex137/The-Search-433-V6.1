      <h2>Never-before-seen video of missile fired at mystery 'orb' shown at UFO hearing</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON — A House committee hearing has featured never-before-seen video that purportedly shows a missile strike on an unidentified object described as "an orb" off the coast of Yemen. The footage, revealed by Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., during the Oversight Committee hearing on October 30, 2024, has sparked renewed interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), also known as UFOs. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the incident.</p>

<p>The significance of this hearing lies in its exploration of transparency and whistleblower protection concerning UAPs. This event marks the third congressional hearing following alarming testimonies in July 2023, where a whistleblower claimed that the U.S. government is hiding a long-standing program to retrieve and reverse-engineer UFOs. The Pentagon has refuted these allegations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of video: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location of incident: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Type of drone used: MQ-9 Reaper</li>
    <li>Type of missile fired: Hellfire missile</li>
    <li>Congressman revealing footage: Eric Burlison, R-Mo.</li>
    <li>Panelist commenting on video: Air Force Veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, Rep. Eric Burlison presented video footage during a House Oversight Committee hearing. The video allegedly shows a missile launched from an MQ-9 Reaper drone striking an object off the coast of Yemen. The footage reportedly depicts the object deflecting and partially disintegrating upon impact.</p>

<p>This hearing is part of an ongoing investigation into UAPs, building on testimonies from July 2023, where a whistleblower suggested the government has concealed information regarding UFO retrieval and reverse-engineering programs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We stand at a pivotal moment in history. The question is no longer whether these events are real, but whether we have the courage to face them. True leadership requires vision, a willingness to confront the unknown with transparency and resolve, so I ask the Congress to help we the people, enact this vision,”</blockquote>
<p>— Air Force Veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing follows a series of congressional discussions aimed at increasing transparency around UAPs. Previous allegations from whistleblowers have raised concerns about government secrecy regarding the existence and study of UFOs. The Pentagon has consistently denied claims related to the recovery and reverse engineering of unidentified flying objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the claims surrounding UAPs are expected as Congress considers the implications of the newly revealed footage. The committee may pursue additional hearings or funding for independent research into UAPs.</p>
