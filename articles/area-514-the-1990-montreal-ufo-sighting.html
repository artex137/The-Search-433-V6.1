      <h2>Area 514: The 1990 Montreal UFO sighting</h2>

<p>On November 7, 1990, an American tourist reported a UFO sighting while swimming at the rooftop pool of the Hotel Bonaventure in downtown Montreal. Witnesses described the object as a massive round metallic shape adorned with green, amber, and yellow lights, hovering above the hotel for nearly three hours. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the event.</p>

<p>This sighting has prompted ongoing interest and investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena. Authorities, including local police, the RCMP, and NASA, have examined the incident, which remains unexplained more than three decades later.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: November 7, 1990</li>
    <li>Location: Hotel Bonaventure, downtown Montreal</li>
    <li>Duration of sighting: Approximately three hours</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At approximately 7 p.m. on November 7, 1990, the American tourist observed the UFO while swimming in the heated rooftop pool. The sighting quickly attracted the attention of other guests and hotel staff. Lifeguard François Lippé contacted hotel security, prompting the arrival of police.</p>

<p>Upon investigation, police commander Robert Masson ordered that all downtown spotlights be turned off to rule out any optical illusions. Despite these efforts, the UFO remained visible. Radar checks by local airport and military services indicated no flights in the vicinity, further raising questions about the object's nature.</p>

<p>By 9 p.m., media outlets had begun reporting on the incident, drawing public attention to the unusual event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Neither the airport nor the closest military radar outpost had anything on radar,” said Commander Robert Masson, who was among the first responders to the scene.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The object was about the size of five full football fields,” Masson estimated, based on its positioning above a cargo plane visible on radar.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
