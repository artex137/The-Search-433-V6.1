      <h2>3I Atlas: Scientist says Interstellar Object did not change color, decodes mystery behind Blue-Green claims</h2>

<p>A new analysis of the interstellar object 3I ATLAS has revealed that it did not change color as previously claimed, according to Dr. Marco Micheli from the European Space Agency. This finding comes after extensive observations of the object, which has been studied since its discovery in 2019.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it addresses misconceptions about the physical properties of 3I ATLAS. Researchers have been investigating the object's characteristics to understand its composition and behavior better. Dr. Micheli's insights aim to clarify previous reports that suggested the object exhibited a blue-green hue during its flyby of the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery: 2019</li>
    <li>Analysis by: Dr. Marco Micheli, European Space Agency</li>
    <li>Claim of color change: Refuted</li>
    <li>Current status: Ongoing research</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS was first discovered in 2019, marking it as one of the few known interstellar objects to pass through our solar system. Initial observations led to claims of a color change during its approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>Research continued over the following months, culminating in Dr. Micheli's analysis, which concluded that the object maintains a consistent appearance throughout its journey.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our observations indicate that 3I ATLAS has not changed color as previously suggested,” said Dr. Marco Micheli. “This clarification is crucial for our understanding of interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this analysis, other interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, have sparked discussions regarding their physical properties and behaviors. The study of such objects helps scientists learn more about the formation and evolution of the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing research will focus on further observations of 3I ATLAS and similar interstellar objects to enhance our understanding of their characteristics and origins.</p>
