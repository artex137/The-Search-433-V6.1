      <h2>NASA’s planetary defense is triggered by radio signals from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense protocols in response to radio signals detected from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The signals were received on February 5, 2026, prompting immediate action from the agency.</p>

<p>This activation is significant as it marks the first time NASA has responded to signals from an interstellar object. The agency is mobilizing its resources to analyze the signals and assess any potential threats posed by the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: February 5, 2026</li>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Agency Involved: NASA</li>
    <li>Type of Signals: Radio signals</li>
    <li>Response: Activation of planetary defense protocols</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 5, 2026, NASA detected radio signals from the comet 3I/ATLAS. This prompted the agency to activate its planetary defense systems to investigate the source and nature of the signals.</p>
<p>The detection marks a pivotal moment for NASA, as it is the first instance of the agency responding to communications from an interstellar object, showcasing advancements in both technology and planetary defense strategies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The signals from 3I/ATLAS represent a historic moment for planetary defense," said a NASA spokesperson. "We are committed to understanding the implications of this discovery."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>NASA has developed its planetary defense systems to monitor and respond to potential threats from near-Earth objects. The detection of signals from 3I/ATLAS highlights the evolving capabilities in tracking and analyzing interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the signals received from 3I/ATLAS and assess any implications for planetary defense. Further updates are expected as the agency gathers more data.</p>
