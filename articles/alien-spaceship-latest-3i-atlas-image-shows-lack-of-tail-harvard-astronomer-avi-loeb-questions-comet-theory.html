      <h2>Alien spaceship? Latest 3I/ATLAS image shows lack of tail; Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb questions comet theory</h2>

<p>A new image of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has raised questions about its classification as a comet. The image, captured by the R Naves Observatory in Spain, shows that the object lacks a prominent cometary tail, which should have been visible after its recent perihelion passage in late October 2023. This development has sparked renewed speculation about the object's true nature, with claims ranging from it being an exotic comet to a piece of alien technology.</p>

<p>The significance of this finding lies in its potential to challenge established theories about 3I/ATLAS. NASA and other space agencies have described the object as a comet, but the lack of a tail contradicts typical comet behaviour. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has been a vocal critic of the comet theory, suggesting that the object's characteristics indicate it could be an advanced probe from another civilization.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, third known interstellar visitor to our Solar System.</li>
    <li>Observation date: Late October 2023, during perihelion.</li>
    <li>Location: R Naves Observatory, Spain.</li>
    <li>Key figure: Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist.</li>
    <li>Key observation: Lack of cometary tail in the latest image.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2022 and has since been a subject of intense scrutiny. Following its perihelion in late October 2023, scientists anticipated that solar heating would cause sublimation, resulting in a visible tail characteristic of comets. The latest image from the R Naves Observatory has brought this expectation into question.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb has highlighted that the absence of a tail contradicts the behaviour expected from a comet, especially given earlier data indicating non-gravitational acceleration. This has led to renewed discussions about the object's possible origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The lack of a prominent tail adds to the anomalies we have observed with 3I/ATLAS,” said Avi Loeb. “If it were indeed a comet, we would expect to see significant outgassing and a visible tail.” 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar visitors, such as 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov, have been classified based on observable characteristics. However, 3I/ATLAS exhibits behaviour that does not fit typical comet models, leading to speculation about alternative explanations. Loeb has pointed out that the object is significantly larger and faster than its predecessors, further complicating its classification.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and analyses are needed to determine the true nature of 3I/ATLAS. Scientists will continue to monitor the object and gather data to assess its composition and behaviour, while discussions about its classification as a comet or something else remain ongoing.</p>
