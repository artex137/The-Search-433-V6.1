      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth for Historic Flyby</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is set to reach its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2025. NASA has reported that the comet will still be approximately 1.8 astronomical units away, equating to about 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) from our planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Scientists emphasize the importance of observing the comet while it is still within range, as it will continue its journey outward after the flyby.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles / 270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Comet classification: Interstellar comet, active with a coma</li>
    <li>Initial observation date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of initial observation: Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Viewing recommendation: Best seen early pre-dawn, looking east to northeast</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's ATLAS program first reported observations of 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025, from Río Hurtado, Chile. Following this, astronomers refined its orbit using earlier observations from multiple ATLAS sites and Caltech’s Zwicky Transient Facility. This confirmed that the comet is indeed from outside our solar system. The comet has been traveling toward Earth since its initial detection, and it will reach its closest point on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS looks and behaves like a comet,” NASA stated. “We have not seen evidence suggesting otherwise.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as a comet due to its active icy nucleus, which produces a coma. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun, distinguishing it from typical comets. Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the composition of other planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, astronomers will continue to observe it using various telescopes and instruments. The data collected during this close encounter will enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>
