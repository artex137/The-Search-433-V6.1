      <h2>Interstellar object Comet 3I/ATLAS passes Earth on Friday</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 AU (168 million miles or 270 million km). The comet, which made its closest pass of the sun on October 29, 2025, is now heading out of the solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have been closely monitoring its trajectory and characteristics. The comet is currently traveling at a record speed of 130,000 miles per hour (210,000 kph), the highest velocity ever recorded for a solar system visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 1.8 AU (168 million miles or 270 million km)</li>
    <li>Closest pass of the sun: October 29, 2025, at 11:47 UTC (6:47 a.m. CDT)</li>
    <li>Speed: 130,000 miles per hour (210,000 kph)</li>
    <li>Monitoring agencies: NASA, ESA</li>
    <li>Visibility: Not visible to the naked eye; requires a telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars at 4:00 UTC (11:00 p.m. CDT on October 2). At that time, it was approximately 18 million miles (29 million kilometers) from Mars.</p>
<p>NASA held a press conference on November 19, 2025, to present images of Comet 3I/ATLAS collected by various space missions. Scientists have observed the comet's non-gravitational acceleration due to outgassing, a common behavior of comets as they approach stars.</p>
<p>As of now, the comet is visible in the eastern predawn sky for telescope users, with the best viewing expected in late November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This interstellar object is indeed a comet, and nothing related to extraterrestrial life,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA Associate Administrator, during the press conference.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system. Its journey has generated significant interest among astronomers and the public, particularly regarding its origin and characteristics. Previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov, have also sparked discussions about the nature of these celestial visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it heads out of the solar system. Data from the ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) is expected to be received in February 2026, providing further insights into the comet’s behavior and characteristics.</p>
