      <h2>Do aliens exist? Barack Obama says yes but rules out hidden Area 51 conspiracy</h2>

<p>Former US President Barack Obama has stated in a podcast interview that aliens are “real,” while dismissing conspiracy theories about extraterrestrials being hidden at Area 51. Obama made these remarks during a conversation with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen on February 16, 2026.</p>

<p>Obama's comments have reignited discussions about extraterrestrial life and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Officials and experts are now examining the implications of his statements on public interest and government transparency regarding UFO sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> February 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Podcast interview with Brian Tyler Cohen</li>
    <li><strong>Key statement:</strong> Obama claims aliens are “real” but denies existence of hidden extraterrestrial technology at Area 51</li>
    <li><strong>Area 51:</strong> A classified US Air Force facility in Nevada associated with UFO conspiracy theories</li>
    <li><strong>Previous statements:</strong> Obama has acknowledged unexplained aerial sightings in past interviews</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2021, Obama confirmed the existence of military footage showing unidentified aerial objects that defy easy explanation. He stated, “There’s footage and records of objects in the skies that we don’t know exactly what they are.”</p>
<p>On February 16, 2026, during a podcast, Obama discussed the vastness of the universe and the likelihood of extraterrestrial life, while clarifying that he saw no evidence of alien contact during his presidency. He also addressed conspiracy theories regarding Area 51.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them,” Obama said regarding aliens.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“They’re not being kept in Area 51, there’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States,” he added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low,” Obama wrote on Instagram.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has long been linked to claims of recovered extraterrestrial technology. US officials have consistently denied these allegations, stating that the facility is used for testing experimental aircraft and defense technologies. Recent interest in UFOs has surged due to military disclosures of videos showing unidentified aerial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating UAP sightings and may release more information to the public as interest in extraterrestrial life grows.</p>
