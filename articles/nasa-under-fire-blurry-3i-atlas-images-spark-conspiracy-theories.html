      <h2>NASA Under Fire: Blurry 3I/ATLAS Images Spark Conspiracy Theories</h2>

<p>NASA has faced criticism over blurry images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile. The object, officially classified as the third known interstellar visitor to the Solar System, is currently the focus of a two-month global planetary defence campaign that began on November 27, 2025.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it serves as a large-scale exercise for Earth's planetary defence systems, despite the object posing no threat to Earth. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) is monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point, approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometres) from Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First spotted:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 170 million miles (270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign start date:</strong> November 27, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring agency:</strong> International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 1, 2025: The ATLAS telescope in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile, first detects 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>November 19, 2025: NASA holds a press conference to present images of 3I/ATLAS but faces backlash for the low quality of the images.</p>
<p>November 27, 2025: The global planetary defence campaign officially commences, focusing on 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and high interest to the scientific community,” the IAWN stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent interest in 3I/ATLAS has been heightened by claims from Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who suggests the object may be an extraterrestrial craft. He has noted multiple anomalies in the object's behaviour since its discovery, including its cometary tail pointing in an unusual direction.</p>
<p>Despite these claims, both NASA and the United Nations have classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet, maintaining that the current monitoring is a part of standard protocol.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will continue to track 3I/ATLAS until January 2026 as part of this exercise, refining methods for identifying and locating potential threats to Earth. The scientific community remains engaged in ongoing discussions regarding the nature of the object.</p>
