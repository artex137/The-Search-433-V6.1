      <h2>Is comet 3I/Atlas a spaceship? What to know about Harvard professor's theory</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar object, 3I/Atlas, is approaching the sun and is expected to reach its closest point, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2025. While some viral claims suggest it may be an artificial spacecraft, experts, including those at NASA, assert that it is a natural comet showing unusual chemical activity.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/Atlas lies in its status as the third interstellar object ever discovered in our solar system. As it nears the sun, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has proposed a controversial theory that the comet could be an alien object. NASA experts have reassured the public that there is no threat to Earth from 3I/Atlas.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Expected perihelion: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest distance to Earth: 267 million kilometers on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Notable theorist: Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li>NASA's position: Comet is natural, no threat to Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025. As it approaches perihelion on October 29, speculation about its nature has increased, especially following Avi Loeb's claims about its potential artificial origins. On December 19, 2025, the comet is expected to be 267 million kilometers from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "For a spacecraft, perihelion is the optimal time for either acceleration or deceleration by an impulse from an engine, thanks to the gravitational assist from the sun," said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The object appears to be a natural interstellar comet," said experts at NASA, dismissing claims of it being an artificial object.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object confirmed to pass through the solar system, following previous discoveries. Its unusual chemical patterns have sparked interest in comet activity, especially as it approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the comet's chemical activity are ongoing, with astronomers monitoring its trajectory and behavior as it nears perihelion.</p>
