      <h2>Europa Clipper probe captures interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in ultraviolet at 164 million km</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper probe has captured images and data of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on November 6, 2025, from a distance of approximately 164 million kilometers. The probe's Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph (Europa-UVS) recorded the comet in ultraviolet light for seven hours, providing a unique view of its coma and tails.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it occurred while terrestrial telescopes faced challenges due to the position of the Sun. The Europa Clipper, which was launched in October 2024 and is en route to Jupiter, took advantage of its location to gather critical information about this interstellar visitor. Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile, is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 6, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 164 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Comet speed: approximately 246,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Perihelion distance: approximately 203 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet's age: possibly over 7 billion years</li>
    <li>Instrument used: Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph (Europa-UVS)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS system in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Shortly after its detection, astronomers identified it as an interstellar comet due to its hyperbolic trajectory.</p>
<p>The comet reached perihelion in October 2025, coming within approximately 203 million kilometers of the Sun. On November 6, 2025, the Europa Clipper probe successfully captured images and data of the comet, which provided insights into its composition and structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The unique position of Europa Clipper allowed us to observe 3I/ATLAS when it was hidden from ground-based observatories,” said a NASA spokesperson.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This data enriches our understanding of rare interstellar objects and their similarities to solar comets,” the spokesperson added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object confirmed to pass through the Solar System, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicates that it originated outside the Solar System, and its highly eccentric orbit confirms it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun.</p>
<p>The comet's composition, rich in water and volatiles, suggests similarities to solar comets while also highlighting potential differences that may reveal insights into galactic variations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS to compare its composition with local comets. The Europa Clipper is scheduled to arrive at the Jovian system in 2030, where the Europa-UVS instrument will be used to study the atmosphere and surface of Europa, an icy moon believed to have a subsurface ocean.</p>
