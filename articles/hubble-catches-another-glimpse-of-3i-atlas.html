      <h2>Hubble Catches Another Glimpse of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On November 30, 2025, astronomers observed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope as it approaches Earth. The comet, which was first detected on July 1, 2025, is currently making its closest approach to Earth, expected to occur on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides valuable data about the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. The European Space Agency (ESA) has mobilized multiple observatories globally to monitor 3I/ATLAS, enhancing our understanding of such celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Hubble viewed the comet on November 30, 2025, from a distance of about 286 million km.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million km.</li>
    <li>Observations have shown high carbon dioxide levels and low water concentrations in the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to cross Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.</li>
    <li>It will be out of range of Hubble and JWST by the end of 2028.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, prompting astronomers at the ESA to begin observations. In early November 2025, the comet re-emerged from behind the Sun, leading to a series of observations including those by Hubble on November 30. The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These observations have revealed some unusual features, including a composition that is rather high in carbon dioxide and low in water,” ESA astronomers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following previous discoveries that have sparked interest in the study of celestial bodies from outside our Solar System. The ongoing observations aim to enhance our understanding of their characteristics and trajectories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its outbound trajectory, astronomers will maintain observations until it passes beyond the reach of Hubble and JWST by late 2028. Further data may be gathered as it crosses Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.</p>
