      <h2>New Images Of Nasa Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Emerge As It Sets To Make Historic Closest Approach To Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. First detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, this comet is only the third known visitor from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to provide insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Various observatories have recently captured images as the comet approaches Earth, and NASA continues to analyze its data. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has raised questions about its nature, suggesting it may not be entirely natural, but NASA officially classifies it as a comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of discovery: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth on December 2, 2025: 280 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet's nucleus surrounded by a coma extending roughly 40,000 km</li>
    <li>Anti-tail reaches nearly 60,000 km</li>
    <li>Images captured by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and ESA's Juice spacecraft</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, NASA and other space agencies began collecting data on the comet. On November 30, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured new images of the comet from a distance of 286 million kilometers. Two days later, on December 2, amateur astronomers in Namibia took a stunning ground-based image of 3I/ATLAS. On December 4, the European Space Agency shared an image from its Juice spacecraft, which detected dual tails of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As more observations come in, scientists hope to unlock even more clues about this rare interstellar visitor,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist involved in the analysis of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object identified to date, following the detection of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its approach presents a unique opportunity for scientists to study the behavior and composition of celestial objects from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to release further data from its observations of 3I/ATLAS in the coming months, with full results expected in February 2026 from the ESA's Juice spacecraft. Scientists will continue to analyze the comet's behavior as it approaches Earth.</p>
