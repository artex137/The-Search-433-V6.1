      <h2>Elon Musk questions origin of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas in public alert</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, detected in July 2025, has drawn global attention due to its speed exceeding <strong>255,000 km/h</strong> and its hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its origin outside the Solar System. Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, has raised concerns about NASA's silence regarding the comet's unusual properties in a recent post.</p>

<p>This discovery, made at the ATLAS telescope in Chile, is significant as it represents the third recorded interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Scientists are investigating the comet's ability to release water vapor at a rate of <strong>40 kg per second</strong>, even at a distance from the Sun. NASA is actively monitoring the comet, which will reach perihelion on October 30, 2025, at <strong>1.4 astronomical units</strong> from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas detected on July 1, 2025, with pre-discovery observations from June 14, 2025.</li>
    <li>Speed exceeds <strong>255,000 km/h</strong>; trajectory is hyperbolic.</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: between <strong>440 meters</strong> and <strong>5.6 km</strong>.</li>
    <li>NASA's TESS telescope detected early activity in May 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet will reach perihelion on October 30, 2025, at <strong>1.4 AU</strong> from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Comet passed <strong>1.8 AU</strong> from Earth, with no collision risk.</li>
    <li>International Astronomical Union activated a global monitoring network until January 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2025, pre-discovery observations of 3I/Atlas began. The comet was officially identified on July 1, 2025, at the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Initial observations showed an active coma, marking it as distinct from typical comets that activate closer to the Sun. The European Space Agency (ESA) began monitoring the comet closely after it passed <strong>1.8 AU</strong> from Earth.</p>

<p>By August 6, 2025, scientists confirmed ongoing activity at a distance of <strong>6.4 AU</strong> from the Sun, observing significant gas emissions. The comet's perihelion approach on October 30, 2025, has intensified global monitoring efforts, with numerous telescopes participating in data collection.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behavior of 3I/Atlas is unusual and exceptional, surpassing uncertainties observed with 'Oumuamua,” said Sabine Hossenfelder, theoretical physicist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There is a one in 20,000 probability for similar trajectories, which may suggest possible intelligent direction,” stated Avi Loeb from Harvard.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/Atlas follows the discoveries of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, marking a growing interest in interstellar objects. The unique properties of 3I/Atlas, such as its chemical composition and high-speed trajectory, challenge existing models of cometary behavior and raise questions about the origins of such objects.</p>

<p>Debates within the scientific community continue regarding the nature of 3I/Atlas, with some researchers advocating for natural explanations while others explore the possibility of technological origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches perihelion. Observations will be crucial for understanding its composition and behavior, particularly as it becomes more visible in December 2025.</p>
