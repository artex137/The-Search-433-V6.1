      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Carries Key Molecule For Life From Another Star</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has astonished scientists with its emission of carbon-rich compounds, including significant amounts of methanol, which was detected for the first time in another interstellar object. The comet was first observed in July 2025 by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery is crucial as it may shed light on the chemical conditions that contribute to the origins of life. NASA's Martin Cordiner and his team at the Goddard Space Flight Center have initiated investigations using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile to analyze the comet's composition further.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is producing approximately 40 kilograms of methanol per second.</li>
    <li>Hydrogen cyanide is being released at a rate of a quarter to a half a kilogram per second.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third observed interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet's light appears redder than typical solar system comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, scientists first detected 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. As the comet approached the Sun, it formed a substantial cloud of water vapour and gas. Researchers have noted its unusual emissions and redder light, indicating unique surface chemistry.</p>

<p>NASA's team, led by Martin Cordiner, has utilized ALMA to investigate the comet's chemical output. Their findings have revealed the high levels of methanol and hydrogen cyanide, which differ significantly from what is typically found in solar system comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Molecules like hydrogen cyanide and methanol are at trace abundances and not the dominant constituents of our own comets,” said Cordiner. “Here we see that, actually, in this alien comet they're very abundant.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It seems really chemically implausible that you could go on a path to very high chemical complexity without producing methanol,” Cordiner added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of methanol in 3I/ATLAS supports earlier theories that suggested comets rich in metals, such as iron, would produce larger amounts of methanol due to chemical reactions with liquid water. This aligns with the predictions made by Josep Trigo-Rodríguez at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar objects, like 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the composition of other star systems, but 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity to study the building blocks of life in a completely alien environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from ALMA to further understand the chemical processes occurring in 3I/ATLAS. This ongoing investigation aims to reveal more about the comet's origins and the implications of its chemical signature for the search for life beyond Earth.</p>
