      <h2>James Webb Space Telescope Observes Interstellar Comet, 3I/ATLAS, For 10 Minutes And Gathers Massive Amounts Of Data</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS for ten minutes, gathering significant data about the celestial object as it travels through our solar system. The observation took place recently, though the precise date has not been disclosed.</p>

<p>This observation is important as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet detected by astronomers. The data collected will enhance understanding of interstellar bodies and their characteristics. The team analyzing the results has submitted their findings to the Astrophysical Journal Letters, which are also available on ArXiv.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet detected.</li>
    <li>The JWST observed the comet for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>The observation revealed high levels of carbon dioxide outgassing.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the second most CO2-rich comet ever observed.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur in late October, at a distance of 210 million kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope observed comet 3I/ATLAS for a brief period of ten minutes, utilizing its infrared instruments to gather data. Researchers noted that the comet is releasing carbon dioxide at an extraordinary rate, making it one of the most unusual comets observed. The findings were subsequently submitted for publication.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We observed an interstellar space rock with JWST! The data are spectacular, and considering the short (10-minute) observing time, the amount of information we got is astounding.”</blockquote>
<p>— Dr. Martin Cordiner, lead author of the study</p>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is different compared to our usual comets. It is releasing so much CO2; it’s the second most CO2-rich comet ever seen.”</blockquote>
<p>— Dr. Martin Cordiner</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable not only for being an interstellar comet but also for its unique characteristics, including its high carbon dioxide content. The comet’s composition raises questions about its formation and the processes that may have occurred during its journey through space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further observations and theoretical studies to better understand the origins of the carbon dioxide enrichment in 3I/ATLAS and its implications for interstellar objects.</p>
