      <h2>$2M CEO payment</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/ATLAS is approaching the sun, providing scientists with a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the sun by late October. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks just the third known interstellar object passing through our solar system. The University of California, Santa Cruz (UC Santa Cruz) has initiated a program called Shadow the Scientists to engage the public in real-time scientific observation of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered by NASA in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to the sun in late October 2023.</li>
    <li>Shadow the Scientists program allows public participation in astronomical studies.</li>
    <li>Upcoming sessions on September 25 and late November 2023.</li>
    <li>Raja GuhaThakurta is the faculty director at UC Santa Cruz.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, NASA discovered the comet 3I/ATLAS. Since its discovery, the comet has garnered attention due to its extreme speed and unusual characteristics. In response, UC Santa Cruz launched the Shadow the Scientists program to provide public access to real-time astronomical observations.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches the sun, its material will begin to turn into gas, allowing scientists to analyze its composition. The next public sessions to learn about 3I/ATLAS are scheduled for September 25 and late November 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This kind of sensationalism ends up ultimately... causing people to lose faith in more serious, evidence-based research and science,” said Raja GuhaThakurta, faculty director at UC Santa Cruz.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Could this be something that aliens — another civilization — sent to us? That has been starting a conversation,” said Jameeka Marshall of UC Santa Cruz.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS has sparked interest and speculation among the public. Previous interstellar objects have also led to discussions about extraterrestrial life and the nature of our universe. Programs like Shadow the Scientists aim to promote understanding of scientific research and address misinformation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future sessions of the Shadow the Scientists program will focus on the study of comet 3I/ATLAS, with the next events scheduled for September 25 and late November 2023. These sessions will provide opportunities for the public to learn more about the comet and its significance in astronomical research.</p>
