      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Today (Dec. 25, 2025): What’s New After the Flyby, What NASA and ESA Just Saw, and Why It Matters</h2>

<p>On December 25, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object discovered in our solar system, enters a phase of quiet observation after its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet passed at a safe distance of about 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 270 million kilometres) from Earth, with no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it offers a unique opportunity for scientists to study the comet's composition and behaviour as it moves away from the Sun. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) continue to release findings from various spacecraft that have observed 3I/ATLAS, while Breakthrough Listen has conducted a radio search to investigate potential technosignatures.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first reported on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach occurred on December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 astronomical units from Earth.</li>
    <li>Breakthrough Listen conducted observations on December 18, 2025, using the Green Bank Telescope.</li>
    <li>No technosignatures were detected during the radio search, down to a sensitivity of ~100 milliwatts.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of the comet is estimated to be around 1 kilometre in diameter, according to preliminary analyses.</li>
    <li>NASA's observations indicate the nucleus diameter is between ~440 metres and ~5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to remain observable from Earth until spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 1, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is first reported by the ATLAS survey telescope.</p>
<p>October 31, 2025: Astrometric observations of the comet resume after a period of solar proximity.</p>
<p>December 18, 2025: Breakthrough Listen conducts a radio search for technosignatures.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: The comet makes its closest approach to Earth.</p>
<p>December 25, 2025: Scientists continue to analyze data from various observations of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is currently no evidence that interstellar objects are anything other than natural astrophysical objects,” according to the Breakthrough Listen study. “However, because we’ve only seen a handful, checking is scientifically warranted.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has attracted significant attention due to its status as an interstellar object. Previous interstellar comets, such as ‘Oumuamua, have sparked discussions about extraterrestrial life and the nature of such objects. As the number of observed interstellar objects grows, the scientific community is increasingly focused on understanding their origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to analyse data from ongoing observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS. Researchers will monitor the comet's trajectory and behaviour as it moves away from the Sun, with further studies planned to investigate its composition and potential for future research.</p>
