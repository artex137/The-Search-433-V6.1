      <h2>Renowned physicist reveals real reason 3I/ATLAS lost its tail — and it’s not aliens</h2>

<p>Dr. Michio Kaku, a renowned theoretical physicist, has stated that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is likely not an alien spacecraft, but rather an ancient comet showing signs of its age. Kaku made these remarks during an interview with NewsNation on November 8, as the comet prepares for a close pass near Earth in approximately six weeks.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it addresses ongoing speculation about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which has drawn attention from scientists and the public alike. Concerns regarding its potential extraterrestrial origins have prompted discussions among experts and calls for transparency from NASA about the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Age: Approximately 7 billion years</li>
    <li>Close pass near Earth: In about six weeks</li>
    <li>Interview date: November 8</li>
    <li>Physicist: Dr. Michio Kaku</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, theories surrounding 3I/ATLAS have evolved, with various scientists weighing in on its nature. Kaku's comments come amid heightened interest following the comet's appearance and its loss of a tail after passing the Sun. Earlier discussions included speculation about the object transmitting messages to Earth and the involvement of a UN-backed planetary defense network.</p>

<p>On November 8, during the interview, Kaku explained that the unusual appearance of 3I/ATLAS can be attributed to its extreme age and unique composition, which differs from younger comets in the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “In seven billion years, there’s been plenty of time to accumulate garbage. That’s why, for example, the nickel content of the comet is off scale,” said Kaku.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It’s different from comets in our solar system. Those may be only three to four billion years old,” Kaku added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Withholding the data fosters more and more speculation about extraterrestrial origins,” Kaku stated, criticizing NASA's secrecy.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussions surrounding 3I/ATLAS have included input from other prominent scientists, such as Neil deGrasse Tyson and Avi Loeb. Tyson has suggested that while the object could be alien in nature, it most likely is not. Loeb has urged NASA to release data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, claiming delays have hindered access to important images of the comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its behavior and composition. The possibility of obtaining new data from NASA remains uncertain, but experts are hopeful for transparency as the comet’s close pass draws nearer.</p>
