      <h2>Scientists Investigate Comet 3I/ATLAS as Possible Alien Spacecraft</h2>

<p>Scientists have examined the comet 3I/ATLAS, proposing it may have originated from within the solar system rather than being an interstellar object. The comet made its closest approach to Earth in December 2025, travelling at over 200,000 kilometres per hour. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>This investigation is significant as it challenges existing beliefs about the comet's origins. Researchers are now looking into the possibility that 3I/ATLAS could be a natural object used by a hidden civilization for travel across the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Earth in December 2025.</li>
    <li>It travelled at a speed exceeding 200,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>Physicist Avi Loeb has proposed that the comet may possess "mini-jets" and an "anti-tail".</li>
    <li>Loeb suggests the comet could be part of a new category called Trans-Neptunian Technological Objects (TNTOs).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to return approximately every five years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, catching the attention of scientists and the public alike. Discussions regarding its origins began soon after, with various theories emerging about its potential as an alien spacecraft.</p>
<p>Physicist Avi Loeb has been a prominent figure in these discussions, asserting that the comet exhibits characteristics that could suggest it is not just a natural object. He has highlighted the presence of "mini-jets" and an "anti-tail" as points of interest.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "This could also explain the geometric anomalies associated with the alignment between the path of 3I/ATLAS and the ecliptic plane... as well as the other anomalies." </blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb added, "If we ever discover an object that produces artificial light, we would be motivated to send our own spacecraft out there." </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS comes amid ongoing debates about the classification of celestial objects. Avi Loeb has previously challenged conventional views on extraterrestrial life and the characteristics of comets and asteroids.</p>
<p>His theories about hidden civilizations and advanced technologies have sparked both interest and skepticism within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS and its characteristics. Further observations are expected as the comet approaches Earth again in the coming years, potentially leading to new discoveries about its origin and nature.</p>
