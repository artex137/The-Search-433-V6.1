      <h2>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS accelerates and has its trajectory modified as it passes the Sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has accelerated and altered its trajectory as it passes close to the Sun, according to astronomers observing the event. The comet is currently on a path that will bring it near Earth in the coming months.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study the comet's behavior and composition. Astronomers from various space agencies are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to gather data on its trajectory and physical characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently accelerating.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory has been modified due to its proximity to the Sun.</li>
    <li>It is expected to come near Earth in the coming months.</li>
    <li>Astronomers from various space agencies are monitoring the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has been tracked closely by astronomers. Its acceleration and trajectory changes were first noted as it approached the Sun. Observations have been ongoing to assess its path and any potential impacts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The changes in the comet’s trajectory are fascinating and provide insights into its composition,” said a spokesperson from a leading space agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar visitors have offered valuable information about the formation of our solar system. 3I/ATLAS is the latest in a series of comets that have been studied as they pass through our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, gathering data for further analysis and study.</p>
