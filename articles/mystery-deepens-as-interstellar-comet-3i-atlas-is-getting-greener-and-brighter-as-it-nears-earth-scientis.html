      <h2>Mystery deepens as interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is getting greener and brighter as it nears Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has brightened and taken on a green hue as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach set for December 19. Recent images from the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii show that the comet is emitting a distinct green glow, attributed to the vaporization of ice and dust as it nears the Sun, according to Live Science.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant because it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study the composition and behavior of an interstellar object. 3I/ATLAS is the largest and oldest interstellar object observed to date, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Its transformation offers insights into material formed around other stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will be closest to Earth on December 19, at approximately 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Recent images were captured on November 26, 2025, using the Gemini North telescope.</li>
    <li>The comet is emitting tonnes of dust and forming a bright coma and a tail.</li>
    <li>The green hue is caused by diatomic carbon (C2) molecules in its coma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope. It has been observed passing through our solar system since then. On November 26, 2025, scientists captured new images of the comet using the Gemini North telescope, revealing its brightening and color change. The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometres.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The recent change in 3I/ATLAS's colour from red to green suggests that new molecules are being released as it heats up,” scientists noted in a statement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Many comets have a delayed reaction in experiencing the Sun's heat due to the lag in time that it takes for heat to make its way through the interior of the comet,” the statement continued.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its study is crucial for understanding the behavior of materials in other solar systems. The comet's transition from a red to a green hue is a common occurrence in comets, but this specific change offers a unique glimpse into its evolving composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists expect 3I/ATLAS to continue brightening or undergo further outbursts as it approaches Earth. Continued observations will be conducted to enhance understanding of cometary behavior and the physical processes governing interstellar objects.</p>
