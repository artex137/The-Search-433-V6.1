      <h2>New Photo From Hubble Space Telescope Gives Best Look Yet At Interstellar Object Entering Our Solar System</h2>

<p>NASA has captured new images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traveling through our solar system. The object was first spotted while it was still far from the sun and is expected to reach its closest point to the sun around October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Scientists are eager to study the object to learn about its origins and characteristics, as it is believed to be extremely old and moving at a high speed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Current Speed:</strong> Approximately 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> Between 3 and 11 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> Expected on October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> About 130 million miles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected at a distance far from the sun, allowing scientists ample time to prepare for its approach. The Hubble Space Telescope has since captured images of the object, which an amateur astronomer compiled and shared on social media.</p>
<p>The object is believed to have originated near the center of the Milky Way, possibly ejected from its stellar orbit by a passing star billions of years ago.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Plenty of cosmic rays peppering the images, but the comet’s coma looks very nice and puffy,” said the amateur astronomer known as astrafoxen, who shared the compiled images on Bluesky.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a rare category of objects observed entering our solar system. The previous interstellar objects, Oumuamua and Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the composition and behavior of such celestial bodies. Understanding these objects helps astronomers learn more about the dynamics of our galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers plan to conduct more observations using various tools to answer key questions about its origin and trajectory. Further studies will help clarify the nature of this interstellar visitor. </p>
