      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS to pass Mars October 2-3</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Mars at 4 UTC on October 3, 2025, which corresponds to 11 p.m. CDT on October 2. At that time, the comet will be approximately 18 million miles (29 million kilometers) from Mars. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This close encounter is significant as it marks the comet's nearest approach to any planet during its journey through the solar system. Multiple space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are coordinating observations using various spacecraft and orbiters around Mars to gather detailed data on this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> October 3, 2025, at 4 UTC (11 p.m. CDT on October 2).</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> Approximately 18 million miles (29 million kilometers).</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA).</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments used:</strong> ESA’s Mars Express, ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, and NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>Object diameter:</strong> Estimated at 20 km (12 miles).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, NASA provided an updated estimate of the object's size on August 7, 2025, indicating a diameter of about 20 km (12 miles). The comet's closest approach to Mars is scheduled for October 3, 2025, with perihelion occurring on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>During the close approach, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will observe 3I/ATLAS using its HiRISE camera between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. on October 2. ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express will also capture images of the comet on October 3.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Both of the European Space Agency’s satellites around Mars are already aiming their cameras at the comet,” reported Marcia Dunn from the Associated Press.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Marshall Eubanks of Space Initiatives noted, “During the Mars close approach, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will observe 3I with HiRISE.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. Previous studies have suggested that objects like 3I/ATLAS provide valuable insights into the formation of solar systems and the dynamics of icy planetesimals in the galaxy. Researchers have traced its path back 10 million years, attempting to identify its origin star.</p>

<p>Despite examining 93 nominal encounters during its trajectory, scientists have not determined a specific star that significantly influenced its orbit, highlighting the complexities of tracking interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, 3I/ATLAS is expected to be observed by ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) between November 2 and 25, 2025. This will likely provide the best view of the comet as it becomes active, showcasing a bright halo and a long tail.</p>
