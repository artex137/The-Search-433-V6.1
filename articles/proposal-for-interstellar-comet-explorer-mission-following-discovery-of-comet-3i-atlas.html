      <h2>Proposal for Interstellar Comet Explorer Mission Following Discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The recent detection of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in July has prompted a proposal for a mission to study it closely. The Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has developed a mission study aimed at conducting a flyby of the comet, which is the third interstellar object (ISO) observed in the Solar System. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This mission is significant as it offers scientists a chance to gather insights into the conditions of other star systems. The proposed spacecraft would analyze the comet's composition and properties, building on previous studies of ISOs, including 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2017 and 2019, respectively.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the third ISO observed in the Solar System.</li>
    <li>The mission study is led by Dr. Alan Stern, SwRI Associate Vice President.</li>
    <li>The spacecraft aims to conduct a flyby of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Approximately seven ISOs traverse the inner Solar System each year.</li>
    <li>About 10,000 ISOs may pass within Neptune's orbit annually.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers detected comet 3I/ATLAS, marking it as a new interstellar object. Following this discovery, a team at SwRI began developing a mission study for a spacecraft designed to perform a flyby of the comet. The team has outlined the mission's design, objectives, and requirements, leveraging advanced software to simulate feasible trajectories for the spacecraft.</p>

<p>Dr. Mark Tapley, an orbital mechanics expert at SwRI, confirmed that simulations showed a low-energy rendezvous with 3I/ATLAS is achievable. The proposed mission could serve as a model for future exploration of other ISOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is within the interceptable range of the mission we designed, and the scientific observations made during such a flyby would be groundbreaking,” said Matthew Freeman, project manager for the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Alan Stern expressed excitement about the mission, stating that it could provide unparalleled insights into the composition and properties of interstellar objects.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS highlights the increasing frequency of interstellar objects entering the Solar System. Prior studies have shown that these celestial bodies are remnants from the Solar System's formation, offering valuable data on the conditions present in other star systems. As new astronomical facilities are developed, the discovery rate of ISOs is expected to rise.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The SwRI team plans to proceed with detailed mission planning and simulations. If successful, the Interstellar Comet Explorer (ICE) mission could set a precedent for future exploration of interstellar objects.</p>
