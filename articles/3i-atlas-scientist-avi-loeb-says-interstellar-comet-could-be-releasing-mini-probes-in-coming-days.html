      <h2>3I/ATLAS Scientist Avi Loeb Says Interstellar Comet Could Be Releasing 'Mini Probes' in Coming Days</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may release small probes as it approaches the Sun, with its closest approach set for October 29, 2025. The comet is expected to come within approximately 203 million kilometres of the Sun.</p>

<p>This speculation has sparked renewed interest in 3I/ATLAS, which is classified as a comet but is being closely monitored for unusual activity. Loeb, who leads Harvard's Galileo Project, indicated that if the object behaves like a 'mothership', it could deploy mini-probes toward nearby planets during its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is set to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will come within about 203 million kilometres of the Sun.</li>
    <li>It will pass 97 million kilometres from Venus on November 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is projected to approach 267 million kilometres from Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to have a mass of roughly 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA have confirmed that the object's trajectory poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Loeb has outlined a timeline for 3I/ATLAS's journey through the Solar System. The comet will first approach Venus on November 3, 2025, followed by a close pass to Earth on December 19, 2025. By March 16, 2026, it is expected to come within 54 million kilometres of Jupiter, where NASA's Juno spacecraft may capture images or detect any unusual emissions.</p>

<p>Loeb has emphasized the importance of tracking the comet, particularly as it becomes visible again in early November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If we see any unexpected light emissions, radio signals, or smaller bodies moving independently, those could be signs of technological behaviour,” said Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Even if the likelihood of an artificial explanation is small, the implications are huge,” Loeb added, urging for continued monitoring of the object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The classification of 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar comet has led to debates within the scientific community. While most experts view it as a natural comet similar to 2I/Borisov, Loeb argues for the investigation of its potential artificial origins due to the significant consequences such a discovery could entail.</p>

<p>Loeb's remarks have reignited public interest in the possibility of interstellar visitors and the implications for humanity should one be found to have artificial characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Galileo Project will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for any anomalous activity in the coming weeks. NASA and ESA will also maintain their observations to ensure the safety of Earth and gather data on the comet's behaviour.</p>
