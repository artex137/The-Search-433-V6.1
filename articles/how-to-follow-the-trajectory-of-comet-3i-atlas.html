      <h2>How to Follow the Trajectory of Comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>Astronomers have identified Comet 3I/Atlas as an extrasolar object that will pass approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth on December 19, 2026. This comet will leave the solar system and will not return.</p>

<p>The unique composition and age of Comet 3I/Atlas present a significant opportunity for scientific study. Astronomers have calculated its trajectory with precision, allowing for real-time tracking of the comet's path through the solar system. Observations will help scientists better understand its characteristics, although it will not be visible to the naked eye.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will pass Earth on December 19, 2026.</li>
    <li>It will be about 270 million kilometers away, nearly 700 times the average distance to the moon.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory has been accurately calculated by astronomers.</li>
    <li>Real-time tracking is available through websites like The Sky Live and 3Iatlaslive.</li>
    <li>Live broadcasts of the comet's passage can be found on YouTube via NASA's simulator.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, identified as an extrasolar object, has been steadily moving through the solar system. It is expected to pass close to Earth on December 19, 2026. The comet's trajectory and behavior have been monitored since its discovery, allowing scientists to prepare for upcoming observations.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches, powerful telescopes will have the opportunity to observe it for several days. However, its distance will prevent it from being seen without equipment.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/Atlas has not activated the planetary defense protocol,” officials have stated, clarifying misconceptions about its potential threat.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is notable for its unusual composition and age, providing insights into the formation of solar systems beyond our own. The ongoing study of such comets enhances our understanding of astronomical phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth, with plans for detailed observations during its passage. Tracking information will be updated regularly on various platforms to assist interested observers.</p>
