      <h2>JUICE probe observes activity from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft has photographed activity from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during observations made on November 2, 2025. The comet was approximately 66 million kilometres away from JUICE when the image was captured.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insights into the comet's activity following its perihelion, the point in its orbit where it is closest to the Sun. The scientific team has expressed excitement over the findings, which include clear signs of the comet's coma and tails, despite using a navigation camera not intended for high-resolution scientific imaging.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach distance: Approximately 66 million km</li>
    <li>Camera used: JUICE navigation camera (NavCam)</li>
    <li>Expected full data transmission to Earth: February 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 2, 2025, JUICE captured an image of comet 3I/ATLAS during its first observation session. This occurred two days before the spacecraft's closest approach to the comet on November 4, 2025. The spacecraft was positioned farther from the comet than other missions had been previously.</p>
<p>Following the observation, the scientific team decided to share a preliminary image, revealing unexpected clarity and detail regarding the comet's activity, including a visible coma and two tails.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The results surprised the researchers. Although NavCam is not designed to photograph objects in deep space, it managed to capture a clear image of the comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation builds on previous studies of interstellar comets. Earlier missions have explored different aspects of cometary behaviour and characteristics. The JUICE mission aims to enhance understanding of such celestial bodies, particularly as it approaches Jupiter and its moons.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific team will continue to analyse the data collected from JUICE, with full findings expected to be available in February 2026. Further studies will focus on the composition and activity of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
