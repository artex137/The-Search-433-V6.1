      <h2>Harvard Astrophysicist Flags 3I/ATLAS as Potential ‘Black Swan’ Threat to Earth’s Defenses</h2>

<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts – October 27, 2025 – Harvard University astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has warned about the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, describing it as a potential "black swan event" that could pose existential risks to humanity. The object is set to reach its perihelion on October 29, 2025. <strong>Nasa's International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN)</strong> has initiated an emergency observational probe to analyze its unusual trajectory and composition.</p>

<p>This warning is significant as 3I/ATLAS could be more than just a conventional comet. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA's <strong>Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</strong> telescope in Chile, it is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The object measures approximately 10 kilometers in diameter and travels at speeds exceeding 30 kilometers per second.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately 10 kilometers in diameter</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: Over 30 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Minimum distance from Earth: Approximately 1.2 astronomical units on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Emergency observational campaign dates: November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has been under observation since. As it approaches its perihelion on October 29, 2025, initial observations have revealed an anti-solar tail and emissions of nickel tetracarbonyl. NASA's IAWN has mobilized to monitor the object closely.</p>

<p>In September 2025, the object's tail reversed direction, raising questions about its nature. An emergency astrometry campaign is set to begin on November 27, 2025, to refine predictions regarding its trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While it poses no threat, 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise.” – Frank Budnik, ESA orbital specialist</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We should not miss an opportunity, because this is a gift from interstellar space.” – Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows two previous interstellar objects, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Loeb's claims regarding its possible artificial origin have sparked debate within the scientific community, with some researchers expressing skepticism about the extraterrestrial hypothesis.</p>

<p>The object's size and unusual characteristics have led to discussions about planetary defense and the potential implications of encountering an engineered probe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will conduct an emergency observational campaign from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS. Further observations are planned near NASA's Juno spacecraft at Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>
