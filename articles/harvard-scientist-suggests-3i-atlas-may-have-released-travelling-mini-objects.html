      <h2>Harvard scientist suggests 3I/ATLAS may have released travelling mini-objects</h2>

<p>As interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS moves through the inner solar system, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has suggested that it may have released small travelling objects. This claim follows the analysis of new images taken on 20 November, which show unusual jets extending from the comet. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The implications of Loeb's findings have sparked increased interest in the behaviour of the comet. Authorities and astronomers are now closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to determine the nature of the jets and whether they signify the release of natural fragments or something more unusual.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at approximately 60 km per second on a hyperbolic path.</li>
    <li>The jets were observed extending about one million kilometres from the comet.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb's analysis suggests the jets may indicate the separation of "mini-objects" from the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach its nearest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb calculated that objects released at perihelion on 29 October could have travelled a million kilometres in 22 days.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet passed close to Mars earlier this year. After showing no tail for several months, it began brightening and releasing material shortly after perihelion on 29 October. On 20 November, new images capturing unusual jets near the comet were published, prompting Loeb's latest analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The fundamental question is whether these smaller objects are real and not an artefact of a satellite streak, and if real, are they natural or technological in origin?" – Avi Loeb
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This latest analysis builds on earlier discussions regarding the potential for 3I/ATLAS to shed fragments as it approaches the Sun. Loeb had previously suggested that the comet's behaviour might indicate the presence of an artificial structure, which has led to ongoing debates within the scientific community about the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS in the coming weeks to gather more data on the jets and determine their origin. Further analysis will help clarify whether the jets are real objects or imaging artefacts.</p>
