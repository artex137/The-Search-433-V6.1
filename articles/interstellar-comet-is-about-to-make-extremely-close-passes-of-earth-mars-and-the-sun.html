      <h2>Interstellar comet is about to make extremely close passes of Earth, Mars and the Sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Mars on 3 October 2025, followed by a close encounter with Earth on 19 December 2025. The comet, discovered on 1 July 2025, is currently on a trajectory that will take it within 270 million km (170 million miles) of Earth and 28 million km (18 million miles) of Mars, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>The close passes of 3I/ATLAS present a significant opportunity for scientific observation. Authorities and scientists are preparing to utilize various telescopes and spacecraft to capture images and data from this interstellar visitor, which is believed to be the oldest comet ever observed. Observations will enhance understanding of its composition and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: 3 October 2025, at 28 million km (18 million miles).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: 30 October 2025, at 210 million km (130 million miles).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025, at 270 million km (170 million miles).</li>
    <li>Comet discovered on: 1 July 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Estimated speed during approach: 25,000 km (15,500 miles) per hour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by astronomers using the ATLAS survey telescope. Since its discovery, various telescopes, including the Very Large Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope, have captured images of the comet, revealing details about its size and composition.</p>

<p>On 3 October 2025, the comet will make its closest approach to Mars, followed by its closest approach to the Sun on 30 October 2025. Finally, it will pass closest to Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All evidence points to comet 3I/ATLAS passing through our Solar System without hitting any of the planets, including our own,” said an astronomer from NOIRLab, operated by the U.S. National Science Foundation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as it is an interstellar visitor, originating from deep space around a distant star. It distinguishes itself from the majority of known comets, which typically originate from within our Solar System. Its discovery and subsequent observations have provided valuable insights into the characteristics of comets from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to use various robotic rovers and spacecraft, including Mars missions like the European Space Agency's Mars Express and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, to observe 3I/ATLAS during its close approaches. This will allow for further data collection on the comet’s composition and behavior.</p>
