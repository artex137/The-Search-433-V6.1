      <h2>Nasa prepares for close 2025 observation of newly identified comet 3I Atlas</h2>

<p>Nasa has announced plans for a close observation campaign of comet 3I Atlas in 2025, following its identification by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in late 2024. The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth and the Sun in mid-2025, offering a unique opportunity for scientists to gather data.</p>

<p>This observation effort is significant as it aims to provide insights into the primordial conditions of our solar system. Nasa and astronomers worldwide are coordinating to utilize advanced space and ground-based telescopes to capture detailed data on the comet’s composition and behavior, which may shed light on the origins of life on Earth and the potential for life elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I Atlas was first detected in late 2024 by ATLAS.</li>
<li>The perihelion passage is expected in mid-2025.</li>
<li>Nasa is using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope for observations.</li>
<li>Ground-based observatories in Hawaii and Chile will assist with continuous monitoring.</li>
<li>The campaign aims to analyze the comet's chemical composition, including volatile compounds like water ice and methane.</li>
<li>Public engagement initiatives will allow amateur astronomers to participate in tracking the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I Atlas was first identified by ATLAS in late 2024. Since then, researchers have been refining its orbital models to predict visibility and proximity to Earth. As it approaches its perihelion in mid-2025, Nasa has ramped up preparations for a comprehensive observation campaign.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Data gathered from comet 3I Atlas will provide critical clues regarding the distribution of water and organic molecules in the early solar nebula,” a Nasa spokesperson said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of comets has evolved significantly over the years. Historical missions, such as Rosetta and Deep Impact, have transformed our understanding of cometary structures. Each new comet offers a chance to test existing theories and uncover new phenomena, making the study of 3I Atlas particularly relevant to ongoing research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to refine observation strategies and engage the public in tracking comet 3I Atlas. The agency is preparing for any potential changes in the comet's behavior, ensuring that the 2025 observation campaign is as fruitful as possible.</p>
