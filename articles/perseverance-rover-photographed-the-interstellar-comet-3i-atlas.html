      <h2>Perseverance rover photographs interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomy enthusiast Simeon Schmauß has published an image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by the Perseverance rover during its flyby past Mars on October 3. The comet passed at a distance of 30 million km from the planet, but it remains invisible to the naked eye from Mars.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it showcases the capabilities of NASA and ESA’s spacecraft in studying celestial phenomena. Although NASA is unable to make official comments due to the US government shutdown, Schmauß processed publicly available images from the Perseverance rover to reveal the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS flew past Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 30 million km away from Mars during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>The Perseverance rover took a series of images using a 30-second exposure on its Mastcam-Z camera.</li>
    <li>The final image shows a faint cloud of 8th magnitude.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The European JUICE spacecraft will be in a suitable position to observe the comet at perihelion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS passed Mars at a distance of 30 million km. The Perseverance rover captured images of the Martian sky in an attempt to document the comet. Following the flyby, amateur astronomer Simeon Schmauß processed and stitched together twenty images to identify the comet.</p>
<p>NASA is currently unable to comment on the observations due to the US government shutdown, limiting official communications regarding the event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activity of 3I/ATLAS is much lower than it could be if the comet were closer to the Sun,” said an unnamed source familiar with the comet’s characteristics.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being an interstellar visitor, having originated from another star system. Its characteristics have sparked interest among astronomers, particularly given its low visibility from Mars. Additionally, misinformation has circulated regarding other images purportedly showing the comet, which have actually depicted Phobos, Mars' moon.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations are expected as the European JUICE spacecraft will be positioned to observe comet 3I/ATLAS during its perihelion on October 29, 2023. NASA's ability to release official findings remains hindered by the ongoing government shutdown.</p>
