      <h2>Latest NASA Images of 3I/ATLAS From Recent Mars Flyby Stunned Social Media—Here’s Why It Looks So Strange</h2>

<p>Recent images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach to Mars on October 4, 2025, have sparked intense online discussion, with social media users posting theories about the object's unusual shape. The images were captured by NASA’s Perseverance rover as it recorded 3I/ATLAS passing through the Martian night sky from Jezero Crater.</p>

<p>This event has garnered attention due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which has temporarily halted operations at NASA and other agencies. The peculiar appearance of 3I/ATLAS in the images has led to speculation about its nature, with some suggesting it could be more than just a comet. However, experts have clarified that the strange shape seen in the images is likely due to motion artifacts rather than the object's actual form.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of images: October 4, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Jezero Crater, Mars</li>
    <li>Distance of 3I/ATLAS from Mars: approximately 38 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed of 3I/ATLAS: about 68 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Camera used: Perseverance’s Right Navigation Camera (Navcam)</li>
    <li>Time of image capture: 21:33:39 Martian local solar time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 4, 2025, the Perseverance rover captured images of 3I/ATLAS as it flew by Mars. The images were uploaded in raw format to NASA’s multimedia page, where one was later selected as “Image of the Week.” Following the upload, social media users began sharing their interpretations of the comet's appearance, leading to widespread speculation.</p>
<p>Notably, Harvard physicist Avi Loeb analyzed the images and explained that the elongated shape is an artifact of the imaging process rather than a true representation of the comet’s structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The stripe in the Navcam image must have resulted from stacking hundreds of Navcam images over a total time interval of about 10 minutes,” said Avi Loeb, confirming that the appearance of 3I/ATLAS is due to imaging artifacts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS would have looked like a circular spot for an individual snapshot,” Loeb added, explaining the limitations of the camera’s resolution.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time that composite imagery has altered the perception of astronomical objects. Earlier this year, images from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope revealed a similar phenomenon with 3I/ATLAS, creating a dotted line effect. Past occurrences, such as the misinterpretation of images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, have also led to confusion regarding the shapes of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues to affect NASA operations, new imagery from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera is expected to be released soon, which may provide clearer views of 3I/ATLAS and help clarify its characteristics.</p>
