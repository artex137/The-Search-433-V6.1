      <h2>Eric Burlison Reveals UFO Too Big To Move—Could South Korea Hold Humanity's Secret?</h2>

<p>Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison has suggested that a massive unidentified object, described as 'too big to move', may be located at a classified site, possibly in South Korea. Burlison made these comments during a discussion on Reddit's UFO forum, indicating his desire to visit the site but not disclosing its exact location. The implications of his statement prompt questions about global transparency and national security regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>Burlison's remarks have garnered attention as he pushes for increased transparency on UAP issues. As a member of the House Oversight Committee, he introduced the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) Disclosure Act of 2025 in August 2025. This legislation aims to mandate the preservation and public release of government records related to UAPs, amid growing congressional concern about the handling of sensitive sightings by federal agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Eric Burlison is a Congressman from Missouri.</li>
    <li>Comments made on Reddit's UFO forum.</li>
    <li>Burlison introduced the UAP Disclosure Act of 2025 in August 2025.</li>
    <li>The act seeks to preserve and publicly release government records on UAPs.</li>
    <li>In September 2025, Burlison presented a video showing a missile striking an unidentified object.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has not confirmed the video's authenticity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2025, Congressman Eric Burlison introduced the UAP Disclosure Act of 2025, aiming to enhance transparency regarding UAP records. In September 2025, he showcased a video during a congressional hearing, claiming it depicted a missile hitting an unidentified object. The Pentagon's AARO stated it had no comment on the video's authenticity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Burlison has stated he wants to visit a classified site tied to stories about a massive UFO hidden abroad, 'but he will not mention exact location.'</blockquote>
<blockquote>Many unexplained UAP reports remain under investigation without confirmation of extraterrestrial origin, according to the Pentagon's AARO.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Burlison's statements reflect a growing trend among lawmakers advocating for scrutiny of how UAP reports are managed by federal agencies. In late 2024, he questioned a former Pentagon employee regarding alleged secret UFO programs and non-human 'biologics', which critics argue indicate potential cover-ups. However, defence officials maintain that many sightings can be attributed to misidentified aircraft or data errors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congressional discussions on UAP transparency are expected to continue as lawmakers seek to address concerns about federal agencies’ handling of UAP reports. Further investigations may follow as the implications of Burlison's statements and the proposed legislation unfold.</p>
