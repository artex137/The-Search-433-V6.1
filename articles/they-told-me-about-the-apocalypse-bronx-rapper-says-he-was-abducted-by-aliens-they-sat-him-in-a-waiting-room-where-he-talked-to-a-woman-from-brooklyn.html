      <h2>Bronx Rapper Claims Alien Abduction Experience</h2>
<p>Rapper Skitz the P.L.K., whose real name is Rafael Lugo, has recounted an alleged alien abduction that took place in the Bronx. In a documentary titled “Calling All Hybrids,” Lugo describes being taken by extraterrestrial beings and sitting in a setting resembling a college lecture hall alongside a woman from Brooklyn. He reported feeling no fear during the encounter.</p>

<p>This story has garnered attention as public interest in UFOs and alien encounters continues to grow. Recent polls indicate that about 65% of Americans believe in aliens, and approximately one in four claim to have seen a UFO. Authorities and researchers remain skeptical, citing psychological explanations for such experiences.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rapper Skitz the P.L.K. claims abduction occurred in the Bronx.</li>
    <li>The incident was detailed in the documentary “Calling All Hybrids.”</li>
    <li>About 65% of Americans believe in aliens, according to Axios.</li>
    <li>Approximately one in four Americans say they have seen a UFO, per a 2022 YouGov poll.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Rafael Lugo, also known as Skitz the P.L.K., describes his abduction experience in a series of events:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lugo recalls sitting in a lecture hall with a woman from Brooklyn.</li>
    <li>A strange being entered the room, described as boneless and translucent.</li>
    <li>The being presented a hologram of Earth, which was struck by a meteor.</li>
    <li>Lugo claims he was told he would have a job to do during a cataclysmic event.</li>
    <li>He later found himself back in his driveway, observing a UFO fly away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I hear in my mind, and not in my own voice—in another voice that sounded almost robotic, in a way—‘When this happens, you will all have a job to do,’” Lugo said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Alien abduction claims have been a topic of fascination for decades. Studies have suggested that some individuals who report such experiences may suffer from sleep paralysis or memory issues. A 2005 study linked alien abduction claims to psychological phenomena, including false memories created through hypnosis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The documentary “Calling All Hybrids” is expected to continue generating discussion around Lugo’s claims. Researchers may explore the psychological aspects of such experiences further, while public interest in UFOs remains high.</p>
