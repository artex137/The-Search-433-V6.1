      <h2>From 70s to snowflakes: Asheville’s weather set for wild weekend swing</h2>

<p>Asheville, N.C. is bracing for a significant weather change this weekend, with temperatures expected to drop sharply from a mild 21 degrees Celsius on Friday to near -2 degrees Celsius by Monday morning, according to the National Weather Service (NWS) in Greenville-Spartanburg. The forecast indicates a chance of flurries in the area, marking the first snow of the season.</p>

<p>This weather shift is crucial as it will likely end the growing season across much of Western North Carolina. The NWS has advised residents to prepare for the cold by dressing in layers and protecting pets, plants, and pipes from the anticipated freeze.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Friday's high: 21 degrees Celsius; low: 10 degrees Celsius</li>
    <li>Saturday's high: 20 degrees Celsius; low: mid-7 degrees Celsius</li>
    <li>Sunday's high: 19 degrees Celsius, dropping to near -2 degrees Celsius overnight</li>
    <li>Chance of mountain flurries by Monday</li>
    <li>Widespread freezing temperatures expected Monday night</li>
    <li>First flurries of the season possible in Asheville</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Friday morning will start with partly sunny skies and areas of morning fog, transitioning into a chance of late-day showers. By Saturday, the weather remains mild but cools overnight. A strong cold front moves in on Sunday, bringing clouds and scattered showers, with temperatures dropping significantly overnight.</p>

<p>By Monday morning, temperatures are expected to feel like midwinter, with highs struggling to reach the mid-30s and lows in the low 20s. The NWS has warned that this will be the coldest night since early March.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The NWS advises residents to dress in layers, stay dry, and take precautions to protect pets, plants, and pipes from the hard freeze,” said a spokesperson for the National Weather Service.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This dramatic temperature shift follows a period of relatively mild weather in the region. The expected plummet in temperatures and the potential for snow flurries is significant for residents and local agriculture, as it may signal the end of the growing season.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Temperatures are forecast to slowly moderate through the middle of next week, with sunshine returning by Tuesday. Residents are encouraged to stay updated on weather advisories as conditions develop. </p>
