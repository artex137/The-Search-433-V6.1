      <h2>US military and intelligence officials set to release UFO evidence in 2026</h2>

<p>US military and intelligence officials have indicated they may unveil authentic UFO evidence by 2026, as reports emerge of increasing whistleblower threats and political pressure. This potential disclosure follows the release of a documentary in November 2025, which has reignited interest in how the White House has handled information on extraterrestrial craft.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it reflects a growing momentum among military and intelligence personnel willing to speak out. The fiscal year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act has mandated full disclosure of all Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) incidents dating back to 2004, prompting an investigation into whether key evidence has been excessively classified or intentionally withheld.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Potential UFO evidence release set for 2026.</li>
    <li>The documentary "The Age of Disclosure" was released in November 2025.</li>
    <li>The fiscal year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act requires disclosure of UAP incidents since 2004.</li>
    <li>Whistleblower David Grusch has alleged covert programs to retrieve and reverse-engineer UFOs.</li>
    <li>Former Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stated that unidentified objects have been observed over restricted nuclear facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2025, the documentary "The Age of Disclosure" was released, showcasing testimonies from 34 current and former government and military personnel. This film increased public interest and political urgency regarding UFO disclosures. Following this, the fiscal year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act was passed, which demands full disclosure of UAP incidents and an investigation into the classification of related data.</p>

<p>As of now, discussions continue among lawmakers and intelligence officials regarding the implications of these potential revelations. The situation remains fluid as various stakeholders push for transparency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities - and it's not ours,” said Marco Rubio in the documentary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee stated, “2026 is particularly significant due to escalating congressional momentum, whistleblower activity, and cultural shifts that are building unstoppable pressure on government secrecy.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discourse surrounding UFOs and UAPs has gained traction over the past few years, with previous reports and testimonies suggesting a longstanding cover-up by government officials. The push for disclosure reflects a broader trend of increasing public interest and demand for transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Experts suggest that the ramifications of such disclosures could be vast, potentially affecting international relations and financial markets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP incidents will proceed as mandated by the fiscal year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. The outcome of these efforts may depend on the political climate and the willingness of officials to declassify information related to UFOs.</p>
