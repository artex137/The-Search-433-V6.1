      <h2>We may never figure out where interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS came from</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, first spotted in July 2025, may be too altered by cosmic rays for scientists to determine its origin, according to researchers from the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy. The comet, currently passing through our solar system, has shown unusually high levels of carbon dioxide in its coma, raising questions about its formation and history.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges previous assumptions that interstellar comets serve as well-preserved fossils containing vital information about their home star systems. Astronomers are conducting new observations to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to reappear in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Levels of carbon dioxide in its coma are 16 times higher than typical comets.</li>
    <li>Researchers from the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy have studied the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently passing close to the sun and will reappear in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Upcoming observations will be conducted using the James Webb Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: Astronomers first spot comet 3I/ATLAS in our solar system.</p>
<p>November 2025: Researchers reveal that cosmic rays may have radically altered the comet's surface, complicating efforts to determine its origin.</p>
<p>December 2025: The comet is expected to reappear, potentially allowing for new observations and findings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Somehow, this process has been a bit overlooked or taken as a secondary process... for objects like comets or interstellar objects, it has a strong effect,” says Romain Maggiolo, a researcher at the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We have a very exciting few months coming,” says Cyrielle Opitom from the University of Edinburgh regarding upcoming observations of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this research, astronomers believed interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS were well-preserved and could provide key insights into other star systems. The new findings suggest that cosmic rays may have destroyed crucial evidence, prompting a reevaluation of how much information can be gleaned from such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its December reappearance, hoping to uncover more pristine material beneath its surface through observations with advanced telescopes.</p>
