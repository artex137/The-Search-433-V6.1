      <h2>Earth in danger? Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS set to come close to the planet</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing at approximately 270 million kilometres away, according to NASA. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, poses no threat of impact.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers, as it provides a rare opportunity to study material from beyond our solar system. Major observatories, including the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes, are focusing their instruments on 3I/ATLAS to analyze its composition and gather data as it travels through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Roughly 209,000 km/h (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Expected to fade to around magnitude 12, not visible to the naked eye</li>
    <li><strong>Observing telescopes:</strong> Hubble and James Webb among others</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. Since its discovery, it has been the subject of global interest, leading to various speculations about its origins.</p>

<p>NASA has responded to rumors suggesting the comet is an alien spacecraft, stating these claims are unfounded. As December approaches, observatories have begun preparations to observe the comet as it prepares for its closest pass.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, posing no impact threat,” said a NASA representative.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “This is a golden opportunity for science to decode the composition of an object from another star,” the representative added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar body detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Each discovery has provided insights into the materials and conditions present in other solar systems.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar comets have prompted discussions among scientists about the formation of planetary systems and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, major observatories will continue to gather data. The information collected will help scientists compare this comet with others and deepen understanding of the differences in planet-forming disks around various stars.</p>
