      <h2>Hubble data reveals change in rotation of interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS after passing the Sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has demonstrated a new pattern of rotational behavior after it crossed perihelion on October 29, 2025. The object now completes a rotation every 7.1 hours, according to data from the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observations in Italy. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests a direct response of 3I/ATLAS to the gravitational and thermal effects of the Sun. Scientists have indicated that the change in the rotation period may provide critical insights into the object’s composition and behavior as it exits the solar system. Ongoing monitoring will help improve understanding of materials formed in other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the Solar System.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The current rotation period is 7.1 hours, shorter than the previous estimate of 16 to 17 hours.</li>
    <li>Data collection took place between November 20 and December 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>Brightness measurements showed variations of up to 30% in total luminosity.</li>
    <li>The average angle of the jet is measured at 270 degrees.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has been monitored continuously since its discovery in July 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, prompting continuous observations. The object reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, after which scientists began detailed analyses of its rotational behavior. Data collected between November and December 2025 revealed a new rotation rate of 7.1 hours, indicating significant changes in its activity compared to previous observations.</p>

<p>In January 2026, the object is expected to reach a position of near-perfect opposition to the Sun, with Earth positioned between the two. This alignment will allow for enhanced study of the object’s internal structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The drastic reduction in the rotation period suggests the activation of new regions on the object’s surface,” said Abraham Loeb, the lead investigator of the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The dynamics of 3I/ATLAS challenge previous theories about cometary behavior and are crucial for understanding interstellar objects,” added astronomer Toni Scarmato.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov as significant interstellar visitors. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS displays active cometary behavior, enhancing its visibility and trackability. This new data contributes to a broader understanding of planetary formation in different parts of the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it drifts away from the solar system. The focus will be on the long-term stability of its rotational period and the potential impact of ongoing mass loss on its rotation speed. Further observations are scheduled for the coming months to refine existing models and enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
