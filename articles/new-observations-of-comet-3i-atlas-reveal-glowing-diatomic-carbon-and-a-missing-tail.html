      <h2>New observations of comet 3I/ATLAS reveal glowing diatomic carbon and a ‘missing’ tail</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed to appear green and is currently lacking a visible tail, according to astronomers at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. Researcher Qicheng Zhang captured new images of the comet on Wednesday, November 5, using the facility’s Discovery Telescope, as it moves away from the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the comet’s composition and behavior. Astronomers have noted that 3I/ATLAS is a confirmed interstellar object, likely originating from a distant stellar system, and is only the third recorded interstellar visitor to our solar system. Observations may help improve understanding of the comet's chemical makeup and its journey through space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS captured on November 5, 2023.</li>
    <li>Images taken using the Lowell Discovery Telescope in Arizona.</li>
    <li>Passed perihelion, its closest approach to the sun, on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Displays a distinctive green hue due to diatomic carbon (C₂).</li>
    <li>Observations reveal an asymmetric brightness, stronger on the left side.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third recorded interstellar object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 and has since captivated astronomers with its unique characteristics. It passed perihelion on October 29, marking its closest approach to the sun and peak activity period for observations. On October 31, Zhang conducted the first optical observations post-perihelion, capturing the comet at dawn.</p>

<p>On October 28, Zhang and a colleague published findings noting a rapid brightening of the comet before perihelion and a blue hue observed relative to the sun. The latest images from November 5 have revealed the comet's green glow and the optical illusion of a missing tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet contains many large hydrocarbons which break apart when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun,” Zhang stated. “It’s sort of the same reason that if we stay out in the sun too long without sunscreen, we get sunburnt.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The tail is there but lies directly behind the comet, slightly curved to the left, creating a head-on perspective,” Zhang explained regarding the comet's appearance.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is particularly noteworthy as it may be up to three billion years older than our solar system. Its unique characteristics have led to significant interest in understanding its origins and composition. The comet’s observations are critical for expanding knowledge of interstellar objects and their interactions with the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through space, and further observations will help clarify its chemical composition and physical changes post-perihelion. The rising position of the comet in the sky will allow more observatories and amateur astronomers to track its journey.</p>
