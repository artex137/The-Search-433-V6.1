      <h2>Interstellar comet's solar approach offers unprecedented research opportunity for passing spacecraft</h2>

<p>On 25th October 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is on a trajectory that will see it pass near two operational spacecraft, NASA’s Europa Clipper and the European Space Agency’s Hera probe, between 25th October and 6th November. The comet is approaching its closest solar proximity, scheduled for 30th October.</p>

<p>This event is significant for the scientific community as it presents a rare observational opportunity. Researchers aim to utilize the instruments aboard the spacecraft to study the comet's activity and interactions with solar radiation. Recent observations have shown the comet emitting a substantial jet of material, which provides valuable data for understanding interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching closest proximity to the Sun on 30th October.</li>
    <li>It is projected to pass near NASA’s Europa Clipper and ESA’s Hera probe between 25th October and 6th November.</li>
    <li>The comet has been observed emitting jets of material extending approximately 10,000 kilometres from its nucleus.</li>
    <li>Estimated dust emission rates are around 180 kilograms per second at a distance of 300 million kilometres from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits an unusual “anti-tail” phenomenon.</li>
    <li>This is the first interstellar object included in monitoring efforts by the International Asteroid Warning Network.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 25th October 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, with its closest solar approach scheduled for 30th October. During this period, it will pass near two spacecraft, which will conduct observations.</p>
<p>Recent observations from the Two-meter Twin Telescope at Teide Observatory have documented the comet’s activity, revealing jets of material. Researchers have begun using computational models to predict interactions between the comet and the spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activity of 3I/ATLAS is considerably greater than that of its interstellar predecessor, 2I/Borisov,” said a spokesperson from the scientific community. “This provides valuable comparative data for our understanding of interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the most well-known interstellar comet was 2I/Borisov, which exhibited lower activity levels. The inclusion of 3I/ATLAS in international monitoring exercises marks a notable advancement in the observation of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, astronomers expect increased visibility from Earth. Continued monitoring and research will focus on the comet’s interactions with solar radiation and the data collected by the spacecraft.</p>
