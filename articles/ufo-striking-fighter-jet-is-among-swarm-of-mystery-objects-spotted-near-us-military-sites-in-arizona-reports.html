      <h2>UFO striking fighter jet is among swarm of mystery objects spotted near US military sites in Arizona: reports</h2>

<p>A UFO that struck and damaged a US fighter jet is among a swarm of unidentified objects reported near Air Force training ranges in Arizona. The incident occurred in January 2023 when an uncrewed aerial system (UAS) hit the canopy of an F-16 Viper jet, causing damage and temporarily grounding the aircraft, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This situation is significant as it raises concerns about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and their potential implications for national security. Authorities are currently investigating these incidents, with multiple reports of UAS activity in the area, especially near the US-Mexico border.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in January 2023.</li>
    <li>Object struck the canopy of a $63 million F-16 Viper jet.</li>
    <li>Three additional UAS encounters were reported a day later.</li>
    <li>757 UAP reports filed between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 in the air.</li>
    <li>Only 49 cases marked as “Case closed” in the latest report.</li>
    <li>Some UAS spotted in groups of up to eight at high altitudes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In January 2023, a UAS struck the canopy of an F-16 Viper jet during a training exercise, causing damage and temporarily grounding the aircraft. The FAA documents indicate that this incident is part of a larger pattern of UAS activity in Arizona.</p>

<p>A day after the initial incident, three more UAS encounters were reported. The FAA has documented numerous sightings, leading to increased scrutiny from military and aviation authorities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “What I can tell you is that there has been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the border,” said former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “If supporting information such as radar data corroborates the report, the FAA shares it with the UAP Task Force,” stated the FAA in a recent communication.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent UAS sightings in Arizona are part of a broader trend of increased UAP reports. Since January 2020, small unidentified objects have been observed flying near military air combat training sites. Some US officials, including Ron Vitiello from US Customs and Border Protection, have suggested that these UAS may be utilized by foreign cartels for surveillance or drug smuggling.</p>

<p>Vitiello highlighted the advanced technology used by cartels, which could be linked to their ability to innovate and adapt their operations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the UAS sightings are ongoing, with authorities assessing the potential national security implications. The FAA and the Department of Defense All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office continue to monitor and document these incidents as part of their efforts to address the growing concerns surrounding UAP. Further reports are expected as more data becomes available.</p>
