      <h2>Harvard expert Avi Loeb raises alarm and suggests object 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft</h2>

<p>A group of scientists from Harvard University has raised concerns about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may not be a simple comet. This debate has emerged following the object's unusual behavior, which has been documented in detail by astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The object is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing models of cometary dynamics. The International Asteroid Warning Network has placed 3I/ATLAS on its watch list, though experts assert that it poses no threat to Earth. The findings could reshape our understanding of interstellar objects and their potential origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: over 33 billion tonnes</li>
    <li>Composition: almost pure nickel alloy, with minimal iron</li>
    <li>Age: approximately 10 billion years</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at perihelion: 1.8 times the distance from Earth to the Sun</li>
    <li>Status: included on the International Asteroid Warning Network watch list</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Scientists first observed the unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS, noting its "anticone" emission directed toward the Sun. This behavior contradicted physical laws governing comet dynamics. Following this, the object's structure evolved to resemble a conventional comet tail.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has documented these anomalies on his Medium blog, suggesting they might indicate a deliberate braking maneuver, although this remains speculative.</p>

<p>As of now, the International Asteroid Warning Network has monitored the object, affirming it does not pose a danger to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The accumulation of anomalies has led us to include 3I/ATLAS on our watch list," said a representative of the International Asteroid Warning Network.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These behavioral changes do not fit with current models of cometary dynamics,” stated Avi Loeb in his blog.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar objects, including 'Oumuamua, which also sparked debates about extraterrestrial technologies. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, however, have intensified discussions in the scientific community about the nature of such objects.</p>

<p>As more data becomes available, the implications of these findings could have far-reaching effects on our understanding of the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Telescopes are set to capture high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS during its perihelion on October 29, 2025, which will provide crucial data to help determine the object's true nature.</p>
