      <h2>First Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS Expected After US Government Shutdown</h2>

<p>NASA is poised to release the first images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS following the recent end of a 43-day US government shutdown. The shutdown concluded after President Donald Trump signed a funding bill on November 12, which includes the budget for science agencies until January 30.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant for researchers and lawmakers who have expressed a keen interest in understanding the comet's characteristics. Among them is Republican Representative Anna Paulina Luna from Florida, who has called for NASA to disclose specific data and imagery related to the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Shutdown lasted 43 days, ending on November 12.</li>
    <li>NASA's budget included in funding bill until January 30.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed approximately 30 million kilometers from Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images captured by China's Tianwen-1 orbiter from October 1 to 4.</li>
    <li>Representative Luna's request includes images from the HiRISE camera taken on October 2 and 3.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2 and 3, the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS. The comet passed within 30 million kilometers of Mars on October 3, 2025. The US government shutdown began on November 12 and officially ended 43 days later, allowing NASA to resume operations.</p>

<p>Following the end of the shutdown, Representative Luna has publicly urged NASA to release the observational data she believes is critical for understanding the comet. She has also called for continued monitoring of 3I/ATLAS through other NASA missions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,” said Representative Anna Paulina Luna regarding her request to NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I encourage NASA to fund additional observations of 3I/ATLAS by the Juno mission near Jupiter,” Luna added in her social media post.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS has escalated due to its unusual characteristics, including signs of non-gravitational acceleration. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet's colour could indicate it possesses non-cometary features, further igniting speculation about its origins.</p>

<p>China's Tianwen-1 orbiter has already captured images of 3I/ATLAS, marking the first attempt to photograph such a distant and dim target, according to the China National Space Administration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to respond to the requests for imagery and data now that the government shutdown has ended. Scientists will likely provide updates on their findings regarding 3I/ATLAS in the coming weeks.</p>
