      <h2>Expectations high after latest images of 3I/ATLAS: interstellar comet shows unusual activity just days away from approaching Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has shown unusual activity as it approaches Earth, reaching a distance of 270 million kilometers on December 19, 2025. This interstellar comet, discovered in July, is expected to be visible to telescopes and space missions for several more months.</p>

<p>The upcoming close approach of 3I/ATLAS is significant for astronomers, as it provides an opportunity to study the comet's composition and behavior. The Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) have captured new images of the comet, which originated outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
  <li>The comet will be 270 million kilometers from Earth at its closest approach.</li>
  <li>It was first discovered in July 2025.</li>
  <li>The Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet on November 30, 2025, from 286 million kilometers away.</li>
  <li>The Juice spacecraft spotted the comet in early November when it was 66 million kilometers from the comet.</li>
  <li>Juice will send most of its data back to Earth in February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025 as it traveled through our solar system. On November 30, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured sharper images of the comet from a distance of 286 million kilometers. Early in November, the Juice spacecraft detected the comet while it was 66 million kilometers away. As the comet approaches Earth, it is expected to reveal more about its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sighting of 3I/ATLAS offers a rare chance to study an interstellar object as it passes through our solar system,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in our Solar System. Previous interstellar objects have provided valuable insights into the composition of materials beyond our solar system, and 3I/ATLAS is expected to contribute to this ongoing research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its activity and gather data from both the Hubble Space Telescope and the Juice spacecraft. Observations will help scientists learn more about the comet before it exits our solar system.</p>
