      <h2>Obama clarifies views on aliens after saying 'they're real' on podcast</h2>

<p>Former US President Barack Obama has clarified his statements regarding extraterrestrial life after comments made during a podcast interview with Brian Tyler Cohen drew significant attention. In the interview published on Saturday, Obama stated, "They're real but I haven't seen them," but later emphasized that the likelihood of Earth having been visited by aliens is "low."</p>

<p>This clarification is significant as it addresses growing public interest in UFOs and the possibility of life beyond Earth. Obama explained that his initial remarks were made in a lighthearted context during a quickfire question segment, and he sought to provide a more nuanced view following the media coverage of his comments.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interview published on Saturday, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Obama served as President from 2009 to 2017.</li>
    <li>Initial comments made during a "lightning" round of questions.</li>
    <li>Clarification posted on Instagram on Sunday.</li>
    <li>No evidence of alien contact reported during Obama's presidency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Obama participated in a podcast interview with Brian Tyler Cohen, where he was asked if aliens are real. His response, "They're real but I haven't seen them," was part of a rapid-fire question segment. Following the interview's release, media outlets reported on his comments, prompting public interest and speculation.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Obama posted a clarifying statement on his official Instagram account. He explained that while statistically, the universe is vast and the odds of life out there are good, the chances of Earth being visited by aliens are low.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify," Obama wrote on Instagram. "Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!" 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Obama has addressed the topic of UFOs. In a 2021 appearance on a late-night talk show, he mentioned asking whether there was a lab for alien specimens and was informed that there was no such facility. He acknowledged the existence of unexplained objects in the sky, suggesting ongoing interest and investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UFOs continues to grow, it remains unclear if further investigations will be conducted by government agencies regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. Public discourse around the topic is likely to persist, especially following Obama's remarks.</p>
