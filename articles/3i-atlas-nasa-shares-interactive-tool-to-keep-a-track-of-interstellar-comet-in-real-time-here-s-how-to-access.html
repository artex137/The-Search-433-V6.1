      <h2>NASA Shares Interactive Tool to Track Comet 3I/ATLAS in Real Time</h2>

<p>NASA has launched an interactive tool to track comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar visitor to the Solar System, which was first spotted on July 1, 2025. The comet passed Mars on October 2, and NASA plans to release images captured by its HiRISE camera during a live event today at 3 p.m. EST.</p>

<p>The launch of the tracking tool, named Eyes on the Solar System, enables users to follow the comet's path in real time. The comet's peculiar characteristics have spurred speculation about its origins, including theories of extraterrestrial intelligence, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. NASA officials will join the live event to share insights and answer questions from the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was confirmed as an interstellar comet on July 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet flew past Mars on October 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nasa's HiRISE camera captured images of the comet, which will be released during a live event.</li>
    <li>The live event is scheduled for November 19, 2025, at 3 p.m. EST.</li>
    <li>NASA's Eyes on the Solar System tool allows users to track the comet's path online.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first identified 3I/ATLAS. The following day, its structure was confirmed, leading to its classification as an interstellar comet. The comet passed Mars on October 2, 2025, but images were delayed due to a government shutdown. After its perihelion on October 29, scientists and stargazers have actively tracked the comet, noting its unusual behavior.</p>

<p>NASA's live event to release images of the comet is set to occur today, November 19, 2025, at 3 p.m. EST, featuring several key NASA officials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “You can follow comet 3I/ATLAS as it speeds through the solar system,” said NASA's official Twitter account, highlighting the capabilities of the Eyes on the Solar System tool.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Have questions? Submit them using #AskNASA and tune in at 3 p.m. EST,” NASA added, inviting public engagement during the live event.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in our Solar System, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its discovery has prompted interest and speculation about the nature of interstellar objects and their potential origins. The peculiar characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have led to discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence, as noted by experts like Avi Loeb.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will release images of 3I/ATLAS during the live event today. The agency continues to monitor the comet as it travels through the Solar System, providing updates and insights to the public through its interactive tools and platforms.</p>
