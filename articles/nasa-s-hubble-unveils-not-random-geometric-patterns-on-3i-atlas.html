      <h2>NASA's Hubble Unveils 'Not Random' Geometric Patterns on 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has detected unusual geometric patterns on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile. The object is currently moving toward Jupiter and challenges existing theories about comet behaviour.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it suggests that 3I/ATLAS does not conform to typical cometary behaviour, according to researchers. The findings may prompt a reevaluation of interstellar objects and their classifications, as 3I/ATLAS exemplifies a highly organized structure rather than the chaotic activity typically associated with comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> 130,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus size:</strong> Estimated between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres wide</li>
    <li><strong>Observation period:</strong> Late November to late December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Next flyby:</strong> March 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth at last observation:</strong> 270 million kilometres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile. Observations of the object began in late November 2025, during which independent image processing revealed its unusual jet structures. By late December 2025, researchers confirmed that the object was approximately 270 million kilometres from Earth.</p>

<p>As it approaches its flyby of Jupiter in March 2026, scientists have noted a remarkable geometric alignment in its jet emissions, which deviates from expected cometary behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are looking at a structured triple-jet system, a clear separation of scales between inner and outer activity and long-term stability where short-term variability would normally dominate,” said Avi Loeb, a researcher at Harvard.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous observations of interstellar objects have shown unpredictable and chaotic activity. The unique patterns observed in 3I/ATLAS challenge established models of comet behaviour and raise questions about the nature of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, researchers will monitor its behaviour closely, especially during its flyby of Jupiter in March 2026. The findings may lead to new theories regarding the classification and understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
