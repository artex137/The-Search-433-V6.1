      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to Make Closest Approach to Sun This Week</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its closest point to the Sun around October 29 and 30, 2025. It will pass at a distance of approximately 1.4 astronomical units, or about 210 million kilometers, just inside the orbit of Mars. Currently, there are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This close approach is significant for astronomers and scientists who are studying the comet's size and physical properties. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are closely monitoring the comet as it approaches the Sun, expecting it to change dramatically as it heats up.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> 1.4 au (210 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Closest Approach Date:</strong> October 29-30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Outside the Solar System</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> May be visible through ground-based telescopes until September 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. Since its discovery, astronomers have tracked its trajectory, confirming it originated from beyond the Solar System. It is the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar neighborhood, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun around October 29-30, 2025. As it approaches, it is anticipated to exhibit increased brightness and a larger tail due to the sublimation of its ices when heated by the Sun. The comet's coma has already been observed, and it may remain visible to telescopes until September 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain at a safe distance,” NASA stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This comet carries clues about the formation of worlds far beyond our own,” the ESA noted regarding its interstellar origin.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is categorized as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic orbital path, which differs from the closed orbits of solar system bodies. Its discovery adds to the understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics, contributing valuable data to ongoing astronomical research.</p>

<p>The previous interstellar objects, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have sparked significant interest in the scientific community, leading to various theories regarding their origins and implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists will continue to analyze data to learn more about its composition and behavior. Observations will be ongoing until September 2025, after which it will be too close to the Sun to observe directly until it reappears on the other side in early December 2025.</p>
