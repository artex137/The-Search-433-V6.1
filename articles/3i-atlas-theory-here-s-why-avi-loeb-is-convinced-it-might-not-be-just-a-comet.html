      <h2>3I/ATLAS Theory: Here's Why Avi Loeb Is Convinced It Might Not Be Just a Comet</h2>

<p>Scientists have raised questions about the nature of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it speeds through our solar system, with Harvard professor Avi Loeb suggesting it might not be a natural comet. Discovered on 1 July 2025, 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object from another star system, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, and is exhibiting unusual features that have captured the attention of the scientific community.</p>

<p>The ongoing debate over 3I/ATLAS's classification is significant as it could reshape our understanding of celestial objects and their origins. Authorities, including NASA, are closely monitoring the comet's behaviour using advanced telescopes to gather more data and clarify its unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: 58 kilometres per second</li>
    <li>Trajectory: Hyperbolic, indicating a one-time pass through the solar system</li>
    <li>Bright blue glow observed around 29 October 2025</li>
    <li>Chemical emissions include carbon dioxide, cyanide, and atomic nickel</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes are monitoring 3I/ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025. As it approached the Sun, scientists observed a significant increase in brightness and a change in appearance around 29 October 2025, documented by NASA spacecraft. Its speed and unusual chemical profile have prompted further investigation into its origins.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has raised the possibility that 3I/ATLAS could be more than a natural comet, suggesting that features such as its blue glow could indicate the presence of artificial light or technology. The scientific community continues to debate this theory as additional observations are forthcoming.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The strange blue glow, so unusual for a comet, could potentially be explained by a hot engine or a source of artificial light,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique characteristics have led to discussions about the formation of celestial bodies in different star systems, with most experts believing it is a natural object shaped by its original environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Upcoming observations in December 2025 are expected to provide more clarity on 3I/ATLAS. Scientists will continue to study its behaviour and chemical emissions as it travels out of the solar system, seizing the opportunity to understand materials that formed beyond our solar system.</p>
