      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas travels at 57 km/s on its definitive escape route from our Solar System</h2>

<p>The global astronomical community has confirmed that comet 3I/Atlas, the third interstellar object detected crossing our cosmic neighborhood, is moving at a speed of 57 kilometers per second. The comet follows a hyperbolic trajectory, ensuring it will not be captured by the Sun's gravity as it exits the Solar System after a brief visit.</p>

<p>This discovery, made in July 2025 by the ATLAS asteroid warning system in Chile, is significant for scientific research. Authorities have been closely monitoring the comet's path, which poses no threat of collision with Earth. Observations have allowed scientists to analyze its unique composition, providing insights into planet formation in distant star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Speed: 57 km/s</li>
    <li>Closest approach (perihelion): October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 2025</li>
    <li>Discovery agency: ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System), Chile</li>
    <li>Notable composition: Rich in carbon dioxide (CO2) and nickel, low in water (H2O)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS asteroid warning system in Chile detected comet 3I/Atlas. Observatories worldwide have since monitored its trajectory, confirming its hyperbolic path. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, where its speed peaked at 68 km/s due to gravitational acceleration.</p>
<p>Throughout its approach, telescopes including the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of its diffuse coma and the unique “antitail” phenomenon, which provided further information about its composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/Atlas through our Solar System is of great scientific importance, as each observation helps to build a more complete panorama of the diversity of objects that populate the Milky Way,” said a representative from the astronomical community.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object detected, following ‘Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov. Previous interstellar objects traveled at significantly lower speeds, making 3I/Atlas's velocity a noteworthy aspect of its classification as an interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study comet 3I/Atlas as it exits the Solar System, analyzing data collected from various observatories and space missions. Further observations will enhance understanding of its composition and the dynamics of interstellar objects.</p>
