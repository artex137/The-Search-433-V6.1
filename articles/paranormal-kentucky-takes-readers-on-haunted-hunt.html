      <h2>‘Paranormal Kentucky’ Takes Readers On Haunted Hunt</h2>

<p>Marie Mitchell and Mason Smith, two retired professors from Eastern Kentucky University, have published a new book titled <em>Paranormal Kentucky: An Uncommon Wealth of Close Encounters with Aliens, Ghosts and Cryptids</em>, which explores the region's paranormal phenomena. The book was released on October 19, 2025, and aims to shed light on various supernatural experiences reported in Kentucky.</p>

<p>This book matters because it seeks to validate the experiences of individuals who have encountered unexplained phenomena. According to the authors, many witnesses face ridicule when sharing their stories, which discourages others from coming forward. The authors hope to create a more comprehensive understanding of these events by compiling credible accounts and historical context.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Book title: <em>Paranormal Kentucky: An Uncommon Wealth of Close Encounters with Aliens, Ghosts and Cryptids</em></li>
    <li>Authors: Marie Mitchell and Mason Smith</li>
    <li>Release date: October 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Background: Both authors are retired professors from Eastern Kentucky University</li>
    <li>Focus: UFOs, ghosts, and cryptids in Kentucky</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Marie Mitchell and Mason Smith began their research on paranormal phenomena while teaching at Eastern Kentucky University. They started collecting stories from students and the public, which led to the idea of writing a book.</p>
<p>During their research, they conducted interviews and gathered historical data to provide context for the reported experiences. They connected with the University Press of Kentucky, which agreed to publish their findings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s fun to talk to people about what they believe they saw, and put it in context, historical context or just regional context – and just try to figure it out.” - Mason Smith</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The problem is a lot of them were ridiculed by coming forward and saying, ‘I think I saw UFO,’ or ‘I think I saw Bigfoot.’” - Marie Mitchell</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The authors highlight that many individuals who report paranormal encounters experience skepticism and ridicule from their communities. This has resulted in a lack of comprehensive data on these phenomena, as potential witnesses may choose to remain silent rather than face judgment.</p>
<p>They also reference the Advanced Aerospace Target Identification Program (AATIP), which aimed to investigate unidentified aerial phenomena but may have benefited from a more accepting attitude towards witnesses over the years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Mitchell and Smith plan to continue their research and engage with the public to encourage more people to share their experiences. They aim to expand their data set and provide further insights into the paranormal phenomena reported in Kentucky.</p>
