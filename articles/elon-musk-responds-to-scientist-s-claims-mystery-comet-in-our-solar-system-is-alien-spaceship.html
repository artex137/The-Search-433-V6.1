      <h2>Elon Musk responds to scientist's claims mystery comet in our solar system is ‘alien spaceship’</h2>

<p>Elon Musk has addressed the debate surrounding the comet 3I/ATLAS, which some scientists speculate could be an 'alien spaceship'. The comet, discovered by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in July, is only the third known interstellar object detected in our solar system.</p>

<p>This discussion has gained traction within the scientific community due to the comet's unique characteristics and the uncertainty surrounding its origin. Authorities, such as NASA, have stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, despite conflicting opinions from some researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 by NASA's ATLAS team.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb suggests a 30 to 40 per cent chance that 3I/ATLAS is not naturally formed.</li>
    <li>Nickel vapour has been detected in the comet's gas cloud.</li>
    <li>Nasa has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, NASA's ATLAS team first observed 3I/ATLAS using the Hubble Space Telescope. The comet's unusual features and speed have made it difficult for scientists to determine its origin. In recent weeks, the comet has exhibited behavior, such as growing a tail and an anti-tail, leading to speculation about its nature.</p>

<p>During a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk discussed the comet and expressed his thoughts on its composition. He highlighted the presence of nickel vapour and mentioned the potential implications of a nickel-rich object impacting Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I keep my promises,” Musk said, assuring Rogan that he would reveal any evidence of aliens if he became aware of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It would be a very heavy spaceship if you made it all out of nickel,” Musk warned, suggesting that such an impact could have catastrophic consequences.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA's Acting Administrator Sean Duffy stated, “There are no aliens and no threat to life here on Earth” posed by the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects since the first confirmed detection of such an object, ‘Oumuamua, in 2017. Research on these objects continues to evolve, with scientists debating their origins and characteristics.</p>

<p>While many experts consider 3I/ATLAS to be a natural object, some, like Avi Loeb, maintain that the possibility of extraterrestrial technology should not be dismissed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Further research and observations may provide additional insights into the comet's nature and origin.</p>
