      <h2>3I/ATLAS Image Revealed By Japanese Space Agency</h2>

<p>A new image claiming to show the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has gone viral, sparking excitement among astronomy fans and scientists globally. The picture, reportedly released by Japan’s space agency, combines spectrum and imaging data to present what some call the most realistic view of the comet to date. Officials have not confirmed its authenticity.</p>

<p>The image first appeared on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), where a user shared it with the caption: “Japanese space agency releases possible image of 3I/ATLAS based on imagery data and spectrum analysis. This is the most realistic image available so far.” The post has reignited global curiosity about the mysterious interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at over 210,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently moving outward and can be viewed through telescopes in the eastern sky before dawn during November and December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile. It passed its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, and is now on a trajectory moving outward from the solar system.</p>
<p>The image claiming to depict the comet was shared on social media on an unspecified date, generating significant interest and speculation among astronomy enthusiasts and scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Japanese space agency releases possible image of 3I/ATLAS based on imagery data and spectrum analysis. This is the most realistic image available so far,” a user stated on social media.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows a hyperbolic orbit, meaning it will not return once it leaves the solar system. The European Space Agency has described such comets as "outsiders," as they carry material from distant star systems, unlike comets that formed within the solar nebula.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar comets, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the composition and behavior of materials from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and scientists continue to assess the authenticity of the newly released image. Further investigations may follow to determine the composition of 3I/ATLAS and its implications for understanding other star systems.</p>
