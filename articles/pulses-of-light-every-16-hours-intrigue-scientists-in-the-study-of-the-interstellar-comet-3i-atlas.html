      <h2>Pulses of light every 16 hours intrigue scientists in the study of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has generated significant interest among scientists as it exhibited regular light pulses every 16 hours during its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. This celestial body, the third confirmed interstellar object visiting our solar system, was detected by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) in Hawaii on June 1, 2025.</p>

<p>The consistent brightness variation observed has provided astronomers with a unique opportunity to study an object that originated from a different star system. NASA confirmed that the comet passed at a safe distance of 274 million kilometers from Earth, allowing researchers to focus on scientific data collection without concerns for safety.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was first identified on June 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, was reached on December 31, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a hyperbolic speed of 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>Light pulses occur every 16 hours, attributed to jets of gas and dust.</li>
    <li>Apparent magnitude ranged between 8 and 9 during peak activity.</li>
    <li>Observations coordinated by a global network of telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was detected on June 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Hawaii. Following its identification, astronomers noted its hyperbolic trajectory and speed, confirming it as an interstellar object. The comet's closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, followed by its perihelion on December 31, 2025.</p>
<p>During this period, researchers observed a consistent brightness pattern, identifying light pulses every 16 hours. These observations led to a deeper understanding of the comet's structure and surface composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The luminosity pattern was so consistent that it allowed researchers to accurately calculate the rotation period of its nucleus,” NASA stated regarding the observations of 3I/Atlas.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is classified as the third interstellar object detected, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its significant chemical differences from solar system comets have raised questions about its origins. The comet's surface chemistry suggests it formed in a cooler environment, with a notable excess of molecular nitrogen.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are continuing to analyze data collected from 3I/Atlas, focusing on its chemical composition and behavior. The scientific community remains active in exploring the implications of its unique characteristics for understanding interstellar objects and the conditions of their formation.</p>
