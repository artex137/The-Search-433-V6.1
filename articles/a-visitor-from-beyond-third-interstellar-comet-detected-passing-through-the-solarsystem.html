      <h2>A Visitor From Beyond: Third Interstellar Comet Detected Passing Through the Solar System</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed the discovery of the third known interstellar object, designated 3I/ATLAS, passing through the Solar System. The comet was detected on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), a global network of telescopes designed to scan for fast-moving celestial bodies. It poses no threat to Earth, passing at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units, which is well beyond the orbit of Mars.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it offers a rare glimpse into material formed around another star. Researchers emphasize the importance of studying interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS to understand the building blocks of distant solar systems compared to our own. The detection also showcases advancements in astronomical capabilities, with systems like ATLAS increasing the likelihood of finding more interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object designated: 3I/ATLAS (officially classified as C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>Date of detection: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Detection agency: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 1.8 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>Trajectory: hyperbolic, not gravitationally bound to the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, ATLAS detected the comet now known as 3I/ATLAS. Initial observations catalogued it as A11pl3Z before follow-up analyses confirmed its interstellar origin. The object's hyperbolic trajectory indicates it is passing through the Solar System only once.</p>

<p>As telescopes around the world continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, researchers aim to gather as much data as possible before it fades from view, providing insights into the comet's composition and the conditions of its formation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The significance of this comet lies not in danger, but in discovery,” said a representative from ATLAS. “Studying such objects allows us to compare the building blocks of distant solar systems with those of our own.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered the Solar System, following the discoveries of 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These interstellar comets are thought to be fragments from the formation of planetary systems elsewhere in the galaxy. Their study helps scientists understand the commonality or uniqueness of our Solar System within the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the Solar System, researchers will analyze the data collected to gain insights into its characteristics and the materials that formed around its parent star. Ongoing observations will be critical to furthering our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
