      <h2>NASA must try 'Oberth maneuver' on Comet 3I/ATLAS, warns Astrophysicist: 'Huge implications for humanity'</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor, has warned that NASA must utilize an "Oberth maneuver" on Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion on October 29, 2025. The comet, which is the third interstellar visitor observed, has recently moved behind the Sun and is currently not visible from Earth.</p>

<p>This maneuver is significant because it could provide insights into the comet's origin, which some experts, including Loeb, speculate may not be entirely natural. Authorities are considering technological approaches to study the comet during its solar conjunction, which could reveal details about its composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached solar conjunction on October 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) is on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has assigned a 30–40% likelihood that the comet does not have a fully natural origin.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently behind the Sun and not observable from Earth.</li>
    <li>The "Oberth maneuver" could maximize the kinetic energy gain or loss during the comet's closest approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 21, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS reached solar conjunction, moving behind the Sun and becoming invisible to observers on Earth. The comet's perihelion is scheduled for October 29, 2025, which is when it will be closest to the Sun.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb has suggested that this timing is critical for potential technological maneuvers that could provide new insights into the comet's nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "If you want to take a vacation, take it before [October 29], because who knows what will happen?" - Avi Loeb
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "As of now, I assign a 30–40% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS does not have a fully natural origin." - Avi Loeb
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS has generated considerable interest and speculation regarding its origin, with some theories suggesting it may be a "mothership" carrying smaller probes. This has led to discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial technology being involved in its trajectory and behavior.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects have also sparked debates about their origins, but 3I/ATLAS's unique characteristics have intensified these discussions, especially regarding its outgassing and trajectory alignment with major planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies are currently evaluating strategies to study Comet 3I/ATLAS during its perihelion, which may involve the proposed Oberth maneuver to gain critical data about the object.</p>
