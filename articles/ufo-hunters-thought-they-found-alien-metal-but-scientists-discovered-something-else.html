      <h2>UFO Hunters Thought They Found Alien Metal, But Scientists Discovered Something Else</h2>

<p>A metal shard linked to the infamous 1947 Roswell UFO incident has been analyzed, revealing that its origins are not extraterrestrial, as many UFO enthusiasts had hoped. Scientists from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have concluded that the shard is primarily composed of magnesium and zinc, with traces of bismuth, lead, and other elements.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it addresses decades of speculation surrounding the Roswell incident, a case that has fueled conspiracy theories about alien life. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has reported on the findings, which suggest the shard is a product of human technology rather than evidence of extraterrestrial visitation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Metal shard analyzed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).</li>
    <li>Shard linked to the 1947 Roswell incident in New Mexico.</li>
    <li>Composition includes magnesium, zinc, bismuth, and lead.</li>
    <li>Analysis conducted by AARO and ORNL scientists.</li>
    <li>No traces of alien biosignatures found.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, reports emerged of a “flying saucer” crash in Roswell, New Mexico. The U.S. military later claimed it was a weather balloon, igniting conspiracy theories about alien technology. Over the years, many have speculated about the nature of the wreckage.</p>

<p>In recent years, the shard gained attention from Tom DeLonge’s To the Stars Academy, which studies Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). The organization hoped the shard could provide insights into UFO technology.</p>

<p>In December 2025, scientists from ORNL reported their findings, concluding the shard had a terrestrial origin, negating previous theories of extraterrestrial involvement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on the technologies developed by humans, waveguides can only channel radiation for purposes of communication, data collection, or heating, but the conjecture for the UAP was that they were used for levitation,” said Avi Loeb, PhD, a theoretical physicist from Harvard University, who did not participate in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Roswell incident has remained a focal point for UFO enthusiasts for decades, often cited as evidence of government cover-ups regarding alien life. The recent analysis of the metal shard further emphasizes the need for scientific scrutiny in the study of UFOs and UAPs.</p>

<p>Some scientists speculate the shard may originate from experimental research on magnesium alloys conducted in the post-World War II era, as these materials were being developed for aircraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the exact origin of the shard may continue, as scientists explore its potential connections to early aerospace experiments. Further studies may also focus on similar materials and their historical context in aviation technology.</p>
