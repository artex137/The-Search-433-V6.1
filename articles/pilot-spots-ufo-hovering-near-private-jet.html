      <h2>Pilot Spots UFO Hovering Near Private Jet</h2>

<p>A pilot of a private jet has reported seeing a “strange, small object” floating beside his aircraft at about 3,500 feet above Rhode Island. The incident occurred near T.F. Green International Airport, where the pilot contacted air traffic control after observing the object, described as a small silver canister, alongside his plane.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it adds to the growing number of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) reports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that such reports are formally documented when raised by pilots. If corroborating evidence, such as radar data, is available, the FAA shares the information with relevant agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred at approximately 3,500 feet altitude.</li>
    <li>Location: Near T.F. Green International Airport, Rhode Island.</li>

    <li>Time of report: Not disclosed.</li>
    <li>FAA has stated they document UAP sightings formally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The pilot first reported the sighting during a communication with air traffic control. He described the object as a small silver canister that appeared to be hovering beside the aircraft. During the exchange, air traffic controllers expressed surprise and asked if the object could be a drone or a balloon, which the pilot dismissed.</p>

<p>The pilot indicated that the object flew alongside his plane for a short duration before disappearing from view. Ground controllers reacted with audible surprise, with one commenting, “Creepy,” and another joking about aliens. Other pilots monitoring the frequency also engaged in the conversation, expressing interest in the sighting.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Looks like a strange, small object that we just floated by. A small silver canister. Do you know what that could be?”

</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader trend of increased reporting of UAP sightings by pilots and other aviation professionals. The FAA has stated that it takes these reports seriously and documents them accordingly, contributing to the ongoing discourse about unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The FAA will continue to monitor the situation and document any similar reports. If additional evidence becomes available, it may be shared with appropriate agencies for further investigation.</p>
