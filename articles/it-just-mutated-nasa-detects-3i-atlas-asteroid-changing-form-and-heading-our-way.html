      <h2>It just mutated — NASA detects 3I/ATLAS asteroid changing form and heading our way</h2>

<p>A Manhattan-sized asteroid named 3I/ATLAS has undergone a significant transformation as it approaches the Sun. The asteroid has switched from exhibiting an unusual “anti-tail” to a typical comet tail, according to recent observations from Spain’s Nordic Optical Telescope. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this celestial event.</p>

<p>The changes in 3I/ATLAS's behavior have raised questions among scientists. The asteroid is currently included in the International Asteroid Warning Network’s target list. Authorities have confirmed that it poses no threat to Earth but present a unique opportunity for astronomical study. This event is notable as 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a mass of approximately 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>The asteroid is on a hyperbolic orbit and will return to interstellar space.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, at 1.8 times the distance of Earth's orbit.</li>
    <li>Observations have shown a transition from an anti-tail to a conventional comet tail.</li>
    <li>The asteroid's anti-tail contained materials including carbon dioxide, water, cyanide, and a nickel alloy.</li>
    <li>This is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023, when it displayed an unusual anti-tail. This phenomenon attracted attention due to its deviation from typical comet behavior. Recent observations from the Nordic Optical Telescope have confirmed a complete reversal in the asteroid's behavior, leading to the formation of a standard comet tail.</p>

<p>The asteroid is now under close observation by various space agencies, including the International Asteroid Warning Network, which has included it in their target list this week.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Although it does not pose any threat to our planet, comet 3I/ATLAS provides a huge opportunity to the community of IAWN to undertake observing activities because it is observable for such a long time from planet Earth and is of high scientific community interest,” the International Asteroid Warning Network said.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    Harvard astrobiologist Avi Loeb suggested, “If it is slowing down with a braking system, the anti-tail would be a representation of the thruster exhaust that would revert to the regular tail configuration after deceleration.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique among interstellar objects due to its ability to alter its behavior mid-trajectory. The nickel alloy found in its anti-tail is not naturally occurring and is only produced through human industrial processes, raising intriguing questions about the asteroid's origins.</p>

<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two objects, ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, had been confirmed to have passed through our solar system, making this a significant event for researchers studying interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey back to interstellar space, scientists plan to conduct further observations to analyze the asteroid’s material composition and behavior. This ongoing research aims to address the unanswered questions surrounding the asteroid and its unusual characteristics.</p>
