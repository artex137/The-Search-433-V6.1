      <h2>Discovery of signals from comet 3I/ATLAS enhances NASA’s planetary defense strategies</h2>

<p>NASA has detected radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS, marking a significant advancement in its planetary defense efforts. The signals were identified on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa, following the comet's close approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is critical as it highlights the urgent need for international collaboration to monitor and safeguard Earth from potential celestial threats. NASA has intensified its analysis of the comet's data as part of its ongoing commitment to planetary security. The agency has also conducted impact simulations to enhance its response strategies regarding similar threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Signals detected on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Location of detection: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa.</li>
    <li>Comet's closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at a distance of 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA's Planetary Defense Program has been actively involved in monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>Collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) is ongoing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS observation system first identified comet 3I/ATLAS as a third interstellar object. Following this, intense observation efforts were initiated due to the comet's unstable orbit and its tendency to eject gas and dust.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope successfully recorded radio signals from the comet, revealing the presence of water molecules and volatile chemicals. This data has provided insights into the comet's internal activity and composition.</p>
<p>NASA conducted a large-scale impact simulation in August 2025 to prepare for potential scenarios involving comet 3I/ATLAS, reinforcing its planetary defense protocols.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS underscores the complexity of celestial objects and our need to understand them better,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Our ongoing research is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows previous observations of interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, which have provided valuable data for refining planetary defense models. The ongoing collaboration between NASA and ESA enhances global capabilities to monitor and protect against potential threats from space.</p>
<p>Research on comet 3I/ATLAS contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of interstellar objects, which is essential for planning future protection missions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from Earth. The agencies aim to collect further data to improve orbital models and refine planetary defense strategies against future celestial threats.</p>
