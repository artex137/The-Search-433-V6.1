      <h2>Florida Congresswoman Shares UFO Experience on Podcast</h2>
<p>Congresswoman <strong>Anna Paulina Luna</strong> has recounted a personal experience involving an unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) while serving in the Oregon Air National Guard. During a recent appearance on <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em>, Luna described an "airspace incursion" that occurred at the Portland Air National Guard Base, where she was serving as an airfield manager.</p>

<h2>Authorities Address UAP Transparency</h2>
<p>Luna has been a vocal advocate for transparency regarding UAPs since taking office in 2023. She leads a task force aimed at the declassification of government intelligence related to these phenomena. Her recent claims have raised discussions about the military's handling of UAP reports and the stigma faced by service members who disclose such encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred at the Portland Air National Guard Base, Oregon.</li>
    <li>Luna served as an airfield manager during her time in the Oregon Air National Guard.</li>
    <li>The airspace incursion involved an unauthorized object entering military airspace.</li>
    <li>Witnessing pilots allegedly refused to provide details about the unidentified object.</li>
    <li>Luna has led a task force in Congress focused on UAP transparency since 2023.</li>
    <li>She claims lawmakers have been shown evidence of "interdimensional beings."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During her service in the Oregon Air National Guard, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna experienced an airspace incursion at the Portland Air National Guard Base. She attempted to gather information from pilots who had witnessed the event, but they declined to share details. This incident has prompted her to advocate for greater transparency regarding UAPs within the government.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “They’re like, ‘Eh, we can’t really talk about it.’ And no one really wanted to address it,” Luna said, referring to the pilots who witnessed the incident.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Based on the photos that I've seen, I'm very confident there's things out there that have not been created by mankind,” Luna stated regarding her belief in interdimensional beings.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Luna's claims come amid a growing interest in UAPs and their implications for national security. Military personnel have historically faced challenges when reporting such sightings, often fearing repercussions for their careers. Luna's push for declassification aims to reduce this stigma and encourage more openness about UAP encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Declassification of Federal Secrets task force, led by Luna, continues to pursue transparency regarding UAPs. Further investigations into reported sightings and discussions within Congress are anticipated as interest in the topic remains high.</p>
