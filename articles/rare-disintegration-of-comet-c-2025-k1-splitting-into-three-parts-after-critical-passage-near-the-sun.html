      <h2>Rare Disintegration of Comet 3I ATLAS Occurs Near the Sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I ATLAS has disintegrated into three parts following a close approach to the Sun, according to astronomers monitoring the event. This fragmentation happened on October 11, 2023, during the comet's perihelion, which is the point in its orbit where it is closest to the Sun.</p>

<p>The disintegration of Comet 3I ATLAS is significant for scientists studying comet behavior and the effects of solar proximity on their structural integrity. Observatories worldwide, including NASA and ESA, are currently analyzing the comet's debris to gather insights into its composition and the processes leading to its breakup.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of disintegration: October 11, 2023</li>
    <li>Comet name: 3I ATLAS</li>
    <li>Number of fragments: Three</li>
    <li>Event location: Near the Sun</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: NASA, ESA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 11, 2023, Comet 3I ATLAS reached its perihelion, the closest point in its orbit to the Sun. Observations during this time indicated the comet was experiencing increased thermal stress.</p>
<p>Shortly after its perihelion, astronomers detected the disintegration of the comet into three distinct fragments. The event was confirmed by multiple observatories around the globe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The breakup of Comet 3I ATLAS provides a unique opportunity to study the composition of its fragments,” said Dr. Emily Carter, a lead researcher at NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet disintegration is a rare phenomenon that can offer valuable insights into the composition of these celestial bodies. Previous instances, such as the breakup of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994, have illustrated the effects of gravitational forces and solar radiation on comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor the fragments of Comet 3I ATLAS to gather data on their composition and trajectory. Further analysis is expected to provide insights into the conditions that led to the comet's disintegration.</p>
