      <h2>House witness testifies UFOs nearly activated Russian nuclear missiles during 1982 incident</h2>

<p>A witness at a congressional hearing has claimed that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) nearly triggered a nuclear crisis for Russia in 1982. George Knapp, an investigative journalist, testified before the House Oversight subcommittee on Tuesday, stating that Soviet documents he obtained in the 1990s indicate a UFO incident almost led to the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).</p>

<p>This testimony raises significant concerns regarding national security and the potential implications of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Lawmakers are now calling for greater transparency and a re-evaluation of classified information related to UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in October 1982 over a Russian ICBM base.</li>
    <li>George Knapp testified before the House Oversight Committee's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.</li>
    <li>UFOs reportedly performed complex maneuvers, including splitting apart and reassembling.</li>
    <li>Launch control codes for ICBMs were activated during the incident.</li>
    <li>Russian officers panicked but the situation returned to normal after the UFOs disappeared.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 1982, UFOs appeared over an ICBM base in Russia. Knapp reported that these objects exhibited remarkable maneuvers for approximately four hours. Towards the end of this period, the launch control codes for the ICBMs were activated, indicating a potential launch. Russian military personnel responded with alarm, believing they were on the brink of a nuclear launch. The UFOs then vanished, and the control systems returned to normal.</p>

<p>Knapp noted that the personnel could not determine the cause of the incident, ruling out electromagnetic pulses and power surges. He indicated that they believed it was a communication from the UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "These UFOs perform incredible maneuvers... They split apart, they fuse back together, they'd appear and disappear." 
    — George Knapp
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "I mean, that was. We were a couple of seconds away from World War III starting, and the UFOs were responsible for it." 
    — George Knapp
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is not isolated, as several other military personnel have reported encounters with UAPs. U.S. Air Force veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli recounted a 2003 incident involving a UAP at Vandenberg Space Force Base, while Chief Alexandro Wiggins described the "Tic Tac" incident, where a UAP displayed no conventional propulsion methods.</p>

<p>The House Oversight Committee's task force is now examining why such incidents have remained classified and what that means for public knowledge and safety.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers are expected to push for increased transparency regarding UAPs and a review of classified documents related to these phenomena. Further investigations into past UAP encounters may also be initiated as a result of this testimony.</p>
