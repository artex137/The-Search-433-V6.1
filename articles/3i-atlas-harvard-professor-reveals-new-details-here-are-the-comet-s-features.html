      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard professor reveals new details - here are the comet's features</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has announced new findings about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may have a man-made metal composition. Data from the Keck II telescope in Hawaii indicates that the comet emits nickel but contains little to no iron, raising questions about its natural origin. The revelations have sparked renewed debate about the object's possible alien technology.</p>

<p>Loeb's findings are significant as they challenge the understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. Authorities, including NASA, classify 3I/ATLAS as a harmless comet, but Loeb emphasizes the need for careful consideration of its implications for humanity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected by Keck II telescope in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>Nickel emissions found; little to no iron present.</li>
    <li>Comet measures at least 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide.</li>
    <li>NASA classifies 3I/ATLAS as a harmless comet.</li>
    <li>Expected to pass behind the sun later this month.</li>
    <li>Will pass by Jupiter early next year before leaving the galaxy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Data from the Keck II telescope has revealed unusual emissions from 3I/ATLAS, prompting Avi Loeb to question its nature. On October 2, NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of the comet, which are pending release. Loeb has characterized the object as a potential “black swan event.”</p>

<p>Loeb has raised concerns about the object's trajectory and size, noting it is significantly larger than previous interstellar objects. His remarks have reignited discussions about the implications of 3I/ATLAS, particularly in light of its unusual properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We only find this in industrially produced nickel alloys,” Loeb explained, highlighting the unusual findings from 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The implications are so huge for humanity, we must consider it seriously,” Loeb stated, urging caution in interpreting the comet's nature.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to a growing list of interstellar objects that have attracted scientific interest. Previous findings have typically involved smaller objects, making the size and composition of 3I/ATLAS particularly noteworthy. The ongoing analysis of its properties may redefine how scientists understand interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it continues its trajectory through the solar system. Further analysis of the images captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter may provide additional insights into the comet's features.</p>
