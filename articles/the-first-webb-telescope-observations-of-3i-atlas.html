      <h2>The First Webb Telescope Observations of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has reported its first observations of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing significant findings about its composition and behavior. The data, collected on August 6, 2025, confirms the presence of a carbon dioxide (CO2) gas plume surrounding the comet, with notably low levels of water (H2O) and carbon monoxide (CO).</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the characteristics of interstellar comets. The Webb telescope's advanced spectral capabilities enhance our understanding of 3I/ATLAS, which has been previously studied by the SPHEREx space observatory. Authorities in the scientific community are now analyzing the implications of these findings for comet research and the origins of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Data from the James Webb Space Telescope collected on August 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a diameter of up to 46 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Mass loss rates: 130 kilograms per second for CO2; 6.6 kilograms per second for H2O; 14 kilograms per second for CO.</li>
    <li>CO2 to H2O output ratio is 8, one of the highest recorded.</li>
    <li>CO2 plume extends beyond 348,000 kilometers from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 6, 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope captured detailed infrared spectroscopy of 3I/ATLAS. This observation confirmed a CO2-rich coma and low levels of H2O and CO. Prior observations by the SPHEREx team, which mapped the CO2 plume from a distance, complemented the Webb findings.</p>

<p>The Webb data showed no cometary tail extending beyond the coma, suggesting that 3I/ATLAS does not release significant dust particles. Instead, the glow around the comet is likely due to the reflection of sunlight off fragments of CO2 ice.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The high CO2 to H2O ratio is puzzling,” said Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project. “This suggests an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus.” 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The mass loss from 3I/ATLAS is extreme compared to typical comets at this distance from the Sun,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its size and composition, with a mass estimated to be a million times greater than that of the previous interstellar comet, 2I/Borisov. This challenges existing theories about the distribution of rocky materials in interstellar space, which suggests that finding such a large object is unexpected.</p>

<p>Previous studies have indicated that the amount of rocky material in interstellar space is insufficient to account for the presence of larger objects like 3I/ATLAS. The comet's trajectory also aligns unusually with the orbital plane of the Solar System, suggesting a targeted path rather than a random approach.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from the Webb telescope to better understand the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS. Further studies may reveal more about the origins of this interstellar object and its implications for our understanding of cometary bodies.</p>
