      <h2>Elon Musk reveals his thoughts on what he believes is behind the UFO sightings in the US</h2>

<p>SpaceX CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong> has stated that he believes recent UFO sightings in the United States are likely the result of classified US government weapons programs rather than extraterrestrial life. Musk shared his views during an interview with <strong>Tucker Carlson</strong> on Monday, where he emphasized that he has "not seen any evidence of aliens." He noted that there are over 6,000 satellites in orbit, yet none have had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>This statement comes amid ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the US military's handling of these reports. The Pentagon is currently under scrutiny as Congress has mandated a review of UFO files dating back to the end of World War II, with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence examining 366 newly identified military sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Musk has stated there are over 6,300 active Starlink satellites in low-Earth orbit as of September 2024.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon has investigated nearly 300 UFO sightings between April 30, 2022, and April 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence reviewed 366 military sightings of UAPs.</li>
    <li>Of the 366 sightings, 26 were identified as drones, 163 as balloon-like entities, and six as clutter in the air.</li>
    <li>US Sen. <strong>Kirsten Gillibrand</strong> has called for an update from the Pentagon on UFO investigations.</li>
    <li>The Department of Defense’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office is responsible for investigating UFOs.</li>
    <li>Jon Kosloski has been appointed to head the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, the conversation around UFOs has intensified. The Pentagon launched a new portal for reporting UFO sightings by service members, government employees, and contractors in late 2022. Following this, nearly 300 sightings were investigated within a year. In 2023, Congress required the Pentagon to review its UFO files, leading to the analysis of 366 military sightings by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.</p>

<p>Senator Gillibrand has indicated that she will receive an update on these investigations, with expectations for testimony from Jon Kosloski likely after the upcoming November 5 election.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “There’s a lot we don’t know,” Musk said regarding the existence of humanity and the universe. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Some pilot sees something moving fast and says, ‘Hey, I saw a UFO!' but it could be a new weapons program that is being experimented with on a need-to-know basis,” Musk explained.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The split second I see any evidence of aliens, I will immediately post that on the X platform,” Musk assured.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of UFO sightings has been a topic of interest for decades. Recent investigations have focused on military encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena, particularly as the Pentagon has released reports indicating that some of these sightings exhibit unusual performance characteristics. Despite extensive scrutiny, no sightings have been positively attributed to foreign activities.</p>

<p>Historically, the government has faced criticism for its lack of transparency regarding UFO sightings and investigations. The ongoing efforts to analyze these phenomena have led to increased public and congressional interest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming weeks, the Pentagon is expected to provide Congress with an update on its UFO investigations, including a progress report on the assessment of unidentified aerial phenomena. Testimony from Jon Kosloski is anticipated to shed further light on the government's findings and future plans regarding these sightings.</p>
