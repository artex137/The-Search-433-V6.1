      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is spraying water across the solar system</h2>

<p>This summer, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS entered our solar system, becoming the third confirmed interstellar comet ever observed. Researchers at Auburn University, using NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, have detected hydroxyl (OH) gas emanating from the comet, indicating the presence of water.</p>

<p>The detection of water on 3I/ATLAS is significant for understanding the behavior of interstellar comets. It allows scientists to compare this comet's activity to those formed within our solar system, providing insights into the formation of planetary systems across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered this summer.</li>
    <li>Hydroxyl gas was detected by NASA's Swift Observatory.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently positioned nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is losing water at a rate of about 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The detection marks the first solid proof of water emission from an interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>The discovery was published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>This summer, 3I/ATLAS entered the solar system and was named. Researchers at Auburn University quickly focused on the comet using NASA's Swift Observatory. They detected hydroxyl gas, a sign of water, which is significant for understanding interstellar comet behavior. The findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "When we detect water -- or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH -- from an interstellar comet, we're reading a note from another planetary system," said Dennis Bodewits, professor of physics at Auburn.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "'Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn't expect it," said Zexi Xing, postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar comets have provided varying insights into the chemistry of other planetary systems. Each discovery has challenged existing knowledge about how comets and planets form around stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has dimmed and is currently out of view but is expected to be observable again after mid-November, allowing scientists to monitor changes in its activity as it approaches the Sun.</p>
