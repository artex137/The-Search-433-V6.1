      <h2>Ross Coulthart claims Australia is a 'hotbed' of UFO sightings</h2>
<p>Investigative journalist <strong>Ross Coulthart</strong> has stated that Australia has become a significant location for UFO sightings, particularly around military bases. Coulthart made the claims while speaking with businessman and podcast host <strong>Mark Bouris</strong> on January 20, 2026.</p>

<p>Coulthart's assertions highlight ongoing concerns regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) near sensitive military installations. He noted that sources from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Tindal have reported multiple sightings of unexplained objects, raising questions among authorities about airspace security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of statements: January 20, 2026</li>
    <li>Location of sightings: RAAF Base Tindal, Richmond, Sydney, Fortescue Metals Group's Solomon mine site, and Alexander Heights</li>
    <li>Time of recent sighting: 5 a.m. on December 7, 2025</li>
    <li>Witnesses involved: A group of six workers at the Solomon mine site</li>
    <li>Previous notable sightings: 1950s and 1960s during British nuclear tests in Maralinga</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the past few months, several UFO sightings have been reported across Australia:</p>
<ul>
    <li>December 7, 2025: Six miners observe an unidentified object near the Solomon mine site at 5 a.m.</li>
    <li>October 2025: A mysterious object is found on fire near a mining site close to Newman, prompting a multi-agency response.</li>
    <li>September 2025: Reports of strange lights in the sky near Point Moore, Geraldton, lead to confusion among residents and the Perth Observatory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I'm currently in touch with people from the RAAF Base Tindal in northern Australia, who tell me that there's been a spate of sightings of anomalous craft,” Coulthart said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “A lot of these UFO sightings seem to cluster around nuclear and strategic assets, and that's not a coincidence,” he added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The Department of Defence does not have a protocol for reporting or recording of UAP or Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO),” Coulthart stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings in Australia date back decades, with notable reports emerging during the British nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s at Maralinga. Former head of the Defence Department's Joint Intelligence Organisation Nuclear Branch, <strong>Harry Turner</strong>, advocated for an investigative team to address UFO incidents.</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing reports, the Department of Defence has not established a formal protocol for documenting these sightings, which raises concerns about airspace security and public awareness.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue monitoring UFO sightings, particularly around military facilities. Investigations into recent incidents remain ongoing, but specific next steps have not been disclosed.</p>
