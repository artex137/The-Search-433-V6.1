      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Interstellar Comet Comes Closest to Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometers (168 million miles) during its closest approach on December 19, 2025, according to the European Space Agency.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. Authorities and astronomers have been tracking the comet since its discovery, monitoring its trajectory and behavior as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 270 million kilometers (168 million miles)</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 60 kilometers per second (134,000 miles per hour)</li>
    <li>Size: Estimated to be about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) wide</li>
    <li>Origin: Direction of the Galactic Center region</li>
    <li>Future trajectory includes a pass by Jupiter in early 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile. Upon noticing its unusual trajectory, they began tracking it. Other observatories in Hawaii and Australia later confirmed it as an interstellar comet.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet passed Earth at its closest distance, allowing astronomers to gather more data about its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is only the third interstellar [object] ever to be detected, hence a precise forecast of the expected frequency is not possible at this point,” said Richard Moissl, head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defense office.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Telescopes have got more technologically advanced and scientists do now scan the night sky continuously. So we may begin to see more of them,” stated Michael Kueppers, a Comet Interceptor Project scientist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of two previous interstellar comets: 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These objects are considered rare and provide valuable insights into the formation of planetary systems.</p>
<p>As technology advances, new telescopes like the Legacy Survey in Space and Time at the Vera Rubins telescope in Chile are expected to enhance the detection of such interstellar objects over the next decade.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, assessing its composition and behavior until it crosses the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune by 2028 and eventually exits the solar system.</p>
