      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Avi Loeb Hasn't Dropped Exocomet's Technological Origin Theory As It Moves To Jupiter; Here's Why</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest flyby of Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.79 AU, or about 270 million kilometers. The comet did not exhibit any unusual characteristics during this pass. Observations from various observatories are pending, and reactions from stargazers have been mixed.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it prompts ongoing discussions about the origins of 3I/ATLAS. Renowned astrophysicist Prof. Avi Loeb has identified 15 anomalies that challenge the comet's natural origin. He maintains that it is essential to consider the possibility of a technological origin for the comet due to its implications for humanity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
<li>Closest distance to Earth was 1.79 AU (approximately 270 million kilometers).</li>
<li>Prof. Avi Loeb has identified 15 anomalies related to the comet.</li>
<li>Loeb's comments were made in a recent blog post.</li>
<li>The Galileo Project is led by Prof. Loeb.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2023, Prof. Loeb flagged 8 anomalies of 3I/ATLAS, but this number has since increased to 15. His assertion remains that the technological interpretation of the comet's origin deserves serious consideration due to potential low-probability, high-impact events.</p>
<p>Loeb has compared the current analysis of 3I/ATLAS to previous dismissals of black swan events, specifically referencing September 11, 2001, and October 7, 2023. He notes that intelligence agencies worldwide have since revised their data collection practices regarding such events.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I repeated what I said before—that 3I/ATLAS is most likely a natural object,” Prof. Loeb stated in his blog.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“My standpoint all along was that we must consider the technological interpretation seriously because of the possibility of a black swan event with low probability and huge implications for humanity,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the flyby, discussions about 3I/ATLAS focused on its unusual characteristics compared to traditional comets. The varying opinions among citizen astronomers highlight the ongoing debate about the object’s nature and origins.</p>
<p>Loeb's attention to anomalies has sparked interest in how the scientific community approaches the study of celestial objects that may not fit established definitions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Prof. Loeb is awaiting further data that could clarify the origin of 3I/ATLAS, particularly the spectrum of the anti-tail jet. This data may help distinguish between natural and technological origins. The scientific community will continue to monitor the comet as it moves toward Jupiter.</p>
