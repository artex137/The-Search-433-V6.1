      <h2>Conspiracy theories over 'alien spaceship' grow despite NASA's definitive statement on what 3I/ATLAS is</h2>

<p>Fresh conspiracy theories suggesting that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is an "alien spaceship" have surfaced online, despite NASA's recent clarification. On 19 November, the space agency released new images of 3I/ATLAS and stated that it is a regular comet, not a sign of an alien invasion.</p>

<p>This matter has gained traction as NASA aims to reassure the public about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. The agency emphasized that the comet poses no threat to Earth, as it will remain at least 170 million miles away. The release of the images coincided with a video from a Texas-based hobby astronomer, which has fueled further speculation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>NASA released new images of 3I/ATLAS on 19 November 2023.</li>
  <li>The comet is only the third object identified as entering the solar system from elsewhere in the galaxy.</li>
  <li>NASA stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, remaining at least 170 million miles away.</li>
  <li>Hobby astronomer Ray's Astrophotography captured images of the comet and claimed it appeared to be rotating.</li>
  <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has suggested there is a 30 to 40 percent chance that 3I/ATLAS is not a naturally formed object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed earlier in 2023. Following the end of the US government shutdown, NASA released new images of the comet on 19 November. The agency reiterated its belief that 3I/ATLAS is a regular piece of space rock, despite ongoing conspiracy theories about its origins.</p>
<p>In the same timeframe, Ray's Astrophotography published a video claiming to show 3I/ATLAS rotating, which has contributed to the renewed speculation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “First observed earlier this year, the 3I/ATLAS comet is only the third object ever identified as entering our solar system from elsewhere in the galaxy,” NASA said after unveiling the new images.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “There are many anomalies of this object, so you can't say conclusively that it's one thing or another. What we should be is curious... and just collect more data,” said Avi Loeb, commenting on NASA's statements.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous comments from Avi Loeb have raised questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it could be a "potentially hostile" alien craft. His remarks have sparked discussions about the validity of NASA's claims regarding the object.</p>
<p>NASA has consistently maintained that 3I/ATLAS is a naturally formed comet, countering conspiracy theories about its origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS and collecting data to further understand its characteristics. The agency remains firm in its position that the object is not a threat to Earth.</p>
