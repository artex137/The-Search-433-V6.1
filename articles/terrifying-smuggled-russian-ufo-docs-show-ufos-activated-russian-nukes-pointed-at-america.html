      <h2>UFO Sighting Nearly Triggered Nuclear Launch, Claims Journalist</h2>

<p>At a congressional hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) on October 24, 2023, investigative journalist George Knapp claimed a 1982 UFO sighting over a Soviet ICBM base nearly led to a nuclear missile launch against the United States. Knapp testified before the House Oversight Committee’s Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, presenting Soviet-era documents he obtained in the 1990s.</p>
