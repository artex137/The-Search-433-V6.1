      <p class="byline">Published 2025-09-15 08:28 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS and Oumuamua: Comets or Alien Technology?</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been detected and classified by NASA’s Minor Planet Center as it travels through our solar system, following a hyperbolic trajectory. The object was identified on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Chile. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant for both scientific research and planetary defense initiatives. Authorities are emphasizing the importance of understanding the characteristics and behaviours of interstellar objects (ISOs) as they may pose risks to Earth. Increased detection capabilities through advanced technologies are expected to enhance our knowledge of these celestial visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date detected:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery location:</strong> Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Over 20 km in width</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> Approximately 1.4 astronomical units (210 million km) on October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility period:</strong> Until September 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 19, 2017, the Pan-STARRS1 telescope detected the first known ISO, Oumuamua, which sparked interest due to its unique characteristics. On August 30, 2019, a second ISO, 2I/Borisov, was discovered. The detection of these objects highlighted the need for enhanced observational capabilities.</p>

<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile identified 3I/ATLAS. This object follows a hyperbolic trajectory, distinguishing it from comets that orbit the Sun. It is much larger than both Oumuamua and Borisov, and its discovery has reignited discussions about the nature and origins of ISOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The detection of 3I/ATLAS not only enhances our understanding of interstellar objects but also underscores the critical importance of planetary defence,” a NASA spokesperson stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, Oumuamua was the first ISO observed, leading to various theories about its composition and behaviour. Researchers have proposed explanations for Oumuamua's acceleration, including outgassing of hydrogen, although definitive answers remain elusive. The detection of 2I/Borisov further exemplified the variability of ISOs, as it resembled a traditional comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to the Sun, scientists plan to conduct extensive observations to learn more about its properties and trajectory. The data gathered could provide insights into the composition of ISOs and inform future planetary defence strategies.</p>
