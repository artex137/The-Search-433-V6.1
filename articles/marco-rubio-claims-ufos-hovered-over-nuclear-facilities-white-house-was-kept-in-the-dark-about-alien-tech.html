      <h2>Marco Rubio claims UFOs hovered over nuclear facilities, White House was 'kept in the dark about alien tech'</h2>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has claimed that Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as UFOs, have flown over restricted nuclear facilities in the United States. He made these allegations in the documentary “The Age of Disclosure,” which was released on Prime Video on November 21, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these incidents.</p>

<p>Rubio's claims, supported by approximately 1,600 Pentagon UAP reports, highlight concerns regarding government transparency about potential threats posed by these phenomena. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has documented these sightings over the past four years. The documentary features testimonies from 34 insiders from the U.S. government and military, asserting that the administration is withholding information about extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary titled “The Age of Disclosure” released on November 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>Approximately 1,600 UAP sightings documented by the Pentagon over the last four years.</li>
    <li>Three public hearings held by Congress since 2022 featuring military whistleblowers.</li>
    <li>Documentary includes testimonies from 34 U.S. government and military insiders.</li>
    <li>Documentary became the highest-grossing film on Prime Video within 48 hours of release.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2022, Congress began hosting public hearings on UAPs, during which retired and active military personnel spoke about their encounters with unidentified objects. These hearings have raised awareness about the government's handling of UAP information.</p>

<p>On November 21, 2023, “The Age of Disclosure” premiered on Prime Video, featuring Rubio and other officials discussing the possible implications of UAP sightings over nuclear facilities. The documentary sparked mixed reactions, being praised by some as a serious investigation but criticized by others for lacking concrete evidence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities—and it's not ours,” said Marco Rubio in an interview for the documentary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Director Dan Farah noted, “This was pretty shocking considering that the allegations were from someone like Rubio, who has the ins and outs of the US administration.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent claims come amid a growing trend of public interest in UAPs, particularly after Congress began examining military encounters with these phenomena. Past incidents have included reports of UAPs exhibiting flight characteristics that defy known physics, leading to increased scrutiny of government transparency regarding potential extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP sightings continue, with Congress likely to hold further hearings as more military personnel come forward with their experiences. The implications of these encounters on national security and government policy remain to be fully addressed.</p>
