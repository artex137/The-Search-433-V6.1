      <h2>UN warned Earth needs a “contingency plan” to combat alien threat amid 3I/ATLAS theories</h2>

<p>The United Nations is being urged to prepare for an extraterrestrial threat to Earth linked to the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, detected earlier this year. Scientists and politicians have raised concerns about humanity's lack of preparedness for a potential alien encounter.</p>

<p>This matter has gained urgency as experts warn of the implications of 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system. Authorities are now discussing the need for a contingency plan to address possible threats from such objects, which may not be entirely natural.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was detected in 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object in the solar system.</li>
    <li>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb estimates a 70% chance that 3I/ATLAS is alien technology.</li>
    <li>Loeb has submitted a white paper to the UN advocating for an international committee on interstellar threats.</li>
    <li>NASA has previously been tasked to identify 90% of potentially hazardous space rocks larger than 140 meters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS was detected, prompting discussions among scientists and politicians about its implications for Earth. Avi Loeb raised the possibility that it may be alien technology and has called for a coordinated response from governments. The urgency of the situation has led to proposals for establishing an international committee to address potential threats from such objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As far as I know, there are no protocols for responding to the discovery of functioning alien devices near Earth. A visitor in our backyard requires immediate attention because it could enter through the front door and pose an imminent threat,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I believe the recent delay in data dissemination from NASA due to the government shutdown does not flag extraterrestrial intelligence but rather terrestrial stupidity,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This warning follows past efforts by the U.S. Congress, which tasked NASA in 2005 with identifying 90% of space rocks that could collide with Earth. However, the unpredictability of alien technology has raised concerns about the adequacy of existing plans. The mystery surrounding 3I/ATLAS has intensified the debate over how humanity would respond to genuine alien contact.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts are advocating for immediate action, including the establishment of a full-sky monitoring system and the creation of advanced observatories in both hemispheres. Loeb argues that funding for these initiatives must significantly increase to ensure preparedness for potential alien threats.</p>
