      <h2>Earth under threat from potentially hostile alien 3I ATLAS</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, currently located behind the Sun, has sparked worldwide speculation about its potential as a hostile alien object. Discovered in July, the comet is now positioned on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, rendering it invisible to telescopes. Scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, are investigating its movement to assess any possible threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as experts examine the unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS. As the comet approaches the Sun, it may release gas and dust, which could provide insights into its composition and origin. Authorities are monitoring the situation closely, awaiting the comet's re-emergence in the coming days for further study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 and is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently about 6.4 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun; Earth is 1 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has predicted a 30 to 40 percent chance that 3I/ATLAS may not be a natural comet.</li>
    <li>NASA's Tom Statler has stated that current data strongly supports the comet theory.</li>
    <li>The comet will be observable again in the coming days as it re-emerges from behind the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. Since then, it has traveled through the solar system, reaching solar conjunction, where it is currently hidden behind the Sun. As it approaches perihelion, scientists are closely observing its behavior and trajectory.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has suggested that if 3I/ATLAS were of alien origin, it might execute an Oberth maneuver, using the Sun's gravity to adjust its path. This could allow a mothership or probe to approach Earth shortly after passing the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "There is a 30 to 40 percent chance that 3I/ATLAS may not be natural," and referred to the situation as reminiscent of a "Trojan Horse scenario."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tom Statler remarked, "All the data available so far indicate that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a comet," emphasizing that evidence supports the comet theory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the interstellar objects ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have previously entered the solar system. These occurrences have spurred interest in the study of interstellar objects and their origins. The current debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflects a broader interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS re-emerges from behind the Sun, scientists will track its trajectory and brightness. They aim to determine if it continues on a natural path or exhibits any unexplained changes. The next few days may yield critical information that could clarify the nature of the comet and address concerns about potential threats to Earth.</p>
