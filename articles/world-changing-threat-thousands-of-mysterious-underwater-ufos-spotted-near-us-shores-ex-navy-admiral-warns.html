      <h2>Thousands of Mysterious Underwater UFOs Spotted Near US Shores</h2>

<p>Thousands of unidentified submersible objects (USOs) have been reported near US coastlines, with over 9,000 sightings logged this year, according to data from the UFO-tracking app Enigma. The surge in reports has raised concerns among experts, who warn that these phenomena could have significant implications. The sightings include glowing lights that appear to vanish into the sea.</p>

<p>The Enigma app, which claims to be the world’s largest database for global UFO sightings, has documented more than 30,000 unidentified aerial and underwater phenomena since its launch in 2022. The increase in sightings, particularly within 10 miles of US shorelines, has drawn attention from scientists and military observers. Authorities are now examining the implications of these unexplained incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Over 9,000 USO sightings recorded in 2023.</li>
    <li>Approximately 500 sightings were logged within 5 miles of shore.</li>
    <li>California reported 389 sightings; Florida reported 306 sightings.</li>
    <li>About 150 reports described objects hovering above or plunging into the water.</li>
    <li>Enigma has documented over 30,000 phenomena since its 2022 launch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The surge in USO sightings has been noted throughout 2023, with a particularly significant increase reported as of August. In July 2019, concerns first escalated when the USS Omaha tracked an unidentified object that disappeared into the Pacific Ocean near San Diego. The Pentagon later confirmed the authenticity of the video showing the object entering the sea without leaving any debris.</p>

<p>Experts have since called for more attention to these reports, highlighting the implications of objects capable of moving seamlessly between air and sea.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena,” said retired US Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet in a March 2024 report for the Sol Foundation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Objects capable of moving seamlessly between air and sea — without crashing or even creating a splash — could have world-changing implications,” Gallaudet added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Concerns regarding unidentified aerial and underwater phenomena have been increasing, particularly following several high-profile incidents involving the military. The USS Omaha incident has been a focal point in discussions about potential national security threats posed by these sightings.</p>

<p>Experts have noted that while many UFO sightings are often dismissed, the growing number of credible reports linked to oceanic activity warrants further investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue their investigations into the recent surge of USO sightings, with a focus on understanding the nature and implications of these phenomena. Further analysis and possible government disclosures may be forthcoming as the situation develops.</p>
