      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Hubble, ESA’s Juice and ‘Ice Volcanoes’ Transform Our View of a Wild Interstellar Visitor</h2>

<p>As of December 6, 2025, astronomers have intensified their observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. This comet, the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, poses no threat to Earth and offers a wealth of scientific insights, according to NASA and ESA.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS, also designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), has revealed itself to be chemically complex and surprisingly active. Observations from various NASA and ESA missions, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice), have provided critical data. Scientists are eager to analyze this data to better understand the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li><strong>Current date:</strong> December 6, 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (270 million km).</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 30, 2025, at about 1.4 AU (210 million km) from the Sun.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Initially moving at about 137,000 mph (221,000 km/h), increasing to around 153,000 mph (246,000 km/h) near the Sun.</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025, at a distance of 29 million km (0.19 AU).</li>
    <li><strong>Next close encounter:</strong> March 16, 2026, passing about 53 million km (0.36 AU) from Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. Initial observations showed it moving as a faint speck in May. Subsequent orbital calculations confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is an interstellar object. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, and made a close flyby of Mars on October 3, 2025.</p>
<p>After perihelion, 3I/ATLAS slipped behind the Sun, becoming less visible from Earth until its re-emergence in December 2025. Notably, it is expected to pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, before continuing toward a close encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS won’t come close to Earth at all,” NASA officials have stated, emphasizing that there is no impact risk associated with the comet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb noted, “The anti-tail stretches to about 60,000 km,” suggesting a possible theoretical phenomenon related to fragments from the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its discovery has prompted a multi-mission observational campaign that includes not only Hubble and Juice but also NASA’s STEREO-A spacecraft. This unprecedented level of attention underscores the scientific community's interest in understanding the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS, including high-resolution images and spectra from the Juice mission, which are expected to be downlinked in February 2026. Researchers anticipate that this data will provide deeper insights into the comet's chemical composition and behavior as it travels through the solar system and back into interstellar space.</p>
