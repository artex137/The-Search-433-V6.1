      <h2>New X-ray images show interstellar comet as it makes closest approach to Earth</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS is making its closest approach to Earth on Friday, coming within approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) of the planet. The comet, first spotted in July 2025, is currently on its way out of the solar system after a brief visit.</p>

<p>This event is significant for scientists, as they have captured new X-ray images of the comet during its approach. Researchers aim to learn more about the comet's origin and composition. The Virtual Telescope Project plans to livestream the comet's appearance at 4:00 a.m. UTC on Friday, or 11 p.m. ET on Thursday, weather permitting.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass Earth on Friday, December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will be approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) away from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet was first discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Optimal viewing requires an 8-inch (20-centimeter) telescope or larger.</li>
    <li>X-ray observations were conducted by Japan’s XRISM for 17 hours in late November.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton observed the comet for about 20 hours on December 3.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 as it entered the solar system. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory and physical characteristics. In late November 2025, Japan's X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) conducted a 17-hour observation of the comet, capturing its X-ray emissions. On December 3, 2025, the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope also observed the comet, further contributing to the data collected about it.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“X-rays can originate from interactions between gases given off by the comet and the continuous stream of charged particles releasing from the sun,” said a representative from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The observations could reveal what the comet is made of — and just how similar or different the object is from those in our own solar system,” an astronomer from the European Space Agency stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar comets, such as those observed in 2017 and 2019, did not yield X-ray emissions, making 3I/ATLAS a unique opportunity for researchers. The study of interstellar comets can provide insights into the materials that exist outside our solar system, enhancing our understanding of cosmic origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from the X-ray observations of 3I/ATLAS. Further studies are planned to confirm the findings and investigate the comet's composition before it exits the solar system in the coming months.</p>
