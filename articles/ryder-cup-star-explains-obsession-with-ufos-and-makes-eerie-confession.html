      <h2>Viktor Hovland shares UFO obsession ahead of Ryder Cup</h2>

<p>Viktor Hovland has expressed his fascination with UFOs as a way to enhance his focus on the golf course during the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, which begins on Friday. The 28-year-old Team Europe star believes his interest in unidentified flying objects helps him avoid obsessing over his golf swing.</p>

<p>Hovland's comments come as Team Europe prepares to defend their title against Team USA in Farmingdale, New York. Teammate Ludvig Aberg noted that Hovland's unusual hobby often generates discussion in the European locker room. Hovland stated that exploring UFO theories allows him to clear his mind and improve his performance.</p>
