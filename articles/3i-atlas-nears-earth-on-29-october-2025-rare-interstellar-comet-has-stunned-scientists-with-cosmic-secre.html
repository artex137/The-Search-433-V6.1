      <h2>3I/ATLAS nears Earth on 29 October 2025: Rare interstellar comet has stunned scientists with cosmic secrets</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth at approximately 1.8 astronomical units (167 million miles) on 29 October 2025. This comet, which originated from beyond our Solar System, poses no threat to Earth but has garnered significant attention from astronomers and the public alike.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS represents a unique scientific opportunity, as it carries materials formed around distant stars. Astronomers are preparing to observe the comet in detail, aiming to gather critical data about its composition and chemical structure. This event marks an important moment for researchers studying the origins of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>It will reach a distance of about 1.8 astronomical units (167 million miles) from Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to have a nucleus less than one kilometre wide.</li>
    <li>It contains chemicals such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, and atomic nickel vapour.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is not visible to the naked eye and requires a large telescope for observation.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reappear around December 2025 after a period of solar conjunction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by astronomers in Hawaii. Its hyperbolic orbit indicated that it was a one-time visitor to the Solar System, likely ejected from another star system. Four major space observatories later confirmed its interstellar nature.</p>

<p>In the months leading up to its closest approach, astronomers have observed unusual activity from the comet, including jets of gas and dust being ejected as it nears the Sun. This activity is attributed to the sublimation of ice on its surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a mystery interstellar object travelling through the Solar System on a hyperbolic path,” said theoretical physicist Michio Kaku.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet is a natural relic of planetary formation in another star system,” noted Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following the discovery of 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike those objects, 3I/ATLAS displays both cometary features and unique gas emissions, providing new insights into interstellar matter.</p>

<p>Scientists are particularly interested in studying interstellar comets as they contain materials from other star systems, offering clues about planetary and comet formation elsewhere in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, gathering data on its composition and activity. The comet will remain visible for several months before departing the Solar System permanently.</p>
