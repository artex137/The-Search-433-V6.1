      <h2>More Than 50 Alien Ships Heading to Earth by 3I/ATLAS? New Observations Go Viral</h2>

<p>Social media users have claimed that over 50 interstellar objects are approaching Earth, following the recent flyby of comet 3I/ATLAS on December 19, 2025. These claims have sparked debates online, with some suggesting the objects could be evidence of alien spacecraft. However, scientists have stated that these assertions lack credible support and are based on misinterpretations of scientific observations.</p>

<p>The controversy surrounding 3I/ATLAS has prompted scientists to clarify the nature of the comet and the validity of the claims regarding the supposed interstellar objects. Authorities, including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, have emphasized that current observations do not support the existence of multiple interstellar objects entering the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS had its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach was approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million kilometres) from Earth.</li>
    <li>No credible scientific evidence supports the presence of over 50 interstellar bodies headed toward Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile detected comet 3I/ATLAS, marking its first observation. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units. Following this event, social media claims about the detection of over 50 interstellar objects began to circulate, leading to widespread speculation about their nature and origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While the claims of alien spacecraft are intriguing, established scientific observations show that 3I/ATLAS is a legitimate interstellar comet,” said a representative from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is no danger to Earth from 3I/ATLAS. Its trajectory confirms it is not a threat,” the representative added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims surrounding 3I/ATLAS echo previous instances of public fascination with interstellar objects. In 2017, the discovery of 'Oumuamua ignited similar discussions about potential extraterrestrial origins. Scientists continue to stress the importance of separating scientific fact from speculation in discussions about celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor and analyze data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and other telescopes. There are currently no announcements regarding investigations or new findings related to the claims of multiple interstellar objects approaching Earth.</p>
