      <h2>V-shaped UFO filmed over Los Angeles</h2>

<p>A V-shaped unidentified flying object (UFO) was filmed hovering over Los Angeles on August 28, 2025, by two residents who captured images and video of the craft. The sighting lasted about 25 minutes, ending around 11:38 p.m. local time (2:38 a.m. ET) when the UFO flew south and disappeared from view, according to reports.</p>

<p>This sighting has reignited discussions about UFOs in urban areas across the U.S. The incident has been reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), which has documented numerous similar sightings this year. Experts are analyzing the footage to determine the nature of the craft, with some speculating it may be a military drone.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: August 28, 2025</li>
    <li>Time of sighting: Approximately 11:13 p.m. to 11:38 p.m. local time</li>
    <li>Location: Los Angeles, California</li>
    <li>Duration of sighting: About 25 minutes</li>
    <li>Reported to: National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) on August 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Number of similar sightings in 2025: 34</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 28, 2025, two Los Angeles residents observed a black, V-shaped craft with nine lights while on their balcony. The object moved slowly and remained in the area for approximately 25 minutes before flying south. The witnesses recorded video footage of the craft, which they later submitted to NUFORC.</p>

<p>On August 30, the sighting was officially reported to NUFORC, which has been cataloguing UFO sightings since 1974. The organization noted that this sighting is part of a broader trend, with multiple reports of V-shaped UFOs across the country this year.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’m convinced that a lot of famous UFO incidents are basically highly advanced terrestrial technology that is 30 to 40 years ahead of what we think they have,” said UFO researcher Mark Christopher Lee. “It’s definitely not flares and is, in my opinion, a structured craft, most likely a top secret drone.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Los Angeles has a notable history of UFO sightings, including the infamous "Battle of Los Angeles" in 1942, when the military fired at what was believed to be an alien aircraft. There have been increasing reports of V-shaped crafts across the U.S. in 2025, prompting experts to consider the possibility of advanced military technology being tested in civilian airspace.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigators from NUFORC will continue to analyze the footage and gather additional reports related to this sighting. Further inquiries may be made to determine if the craft is linked to military activities or other explanations.</p>
