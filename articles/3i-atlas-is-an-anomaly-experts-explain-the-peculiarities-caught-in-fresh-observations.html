      <h2>3I/ATLAS is an anomaly: Experts explain the peculiarities caught in fresh observations</h2>

<p>Fresh observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have revealed several strange features, prompting experts to investigate its anomalies. The comet was officially discovered on July 1 and has displayed unusual behaviour since that time. Recent observations, including images captured by NASA's Perseverance rover, have added to the intrigue surrounding 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges current understanding of comet behaviour. Scientists are now analyzing data from various telescopes to explain the comet's unusual characteristics, which may have implications for future studies of similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images taken on October 5, 2025, by the Perseverance rover showed a bright cylindrical object.</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars when the images were captured: approximately 38 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is losing water at a rate of about 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>At least 8% of the comet's surface is active, compared to the typical 3-5% for comets.</li>
    <li>Nickel emissions detected at a radius of 600 kilometres; no evidence of iron found.</li>
    <li>Observations made by NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the European Space Agency's ExoMars orbiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Observations by NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory noted its unusual water loss during July and August. On October 5, images were captured by the Perseverance rover, revealing a strange cylindrical object above Mars. The European Space Agency released additional images taken by its ExoMars orbiter, which showed a bright coma but no cometary tail.</p>
<p>On October 15, a study identified a high rate of nickel emissions from the comet, further distinguishing it from typical comet behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This dot is the centre of the comet, comprising its icy-rocky nucleus and its surrounding coma,” stated the European Space Agency regarding its observations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard professor Avi Loeb noted that “no known comets, either from within the solar system or interstellar, have ever had this happen,” in reference to the detected nickel emissions.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of comets have shown that they typically develop long tails when approaching the Sun. However, 3I/ATLAS has not exhibited this behaviour, raising questions about its composition and activity. The anomalies observed may point to new phenomena not previously documented in comet studies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from various observatories to understand the peculiarities of 3I/ATLAS. Further studies may lead to new insights into the characteristics of interstellar comets and their behaviour in the solar system.</p>
