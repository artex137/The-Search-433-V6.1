      <h2>3I/ATLAS was just a comet - but could we have defended ourselves if it was aliens?</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has passed Earth without causing any injuries or fatalities. The comet, which was first spotted in July, approached our planet on December 19, 2025, and scientists have confirmed it poses no threat to life on Earth.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its classification as an interstellar object, raising questions about humanity’s preparedness for potential extraterrestrial encounters. Authorities and scientists are now discussing the need for an international alert system to respond to future interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Interstellar comet</li>
    <li><strong>Date spotted:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed at perihelion:</strong> 67,000 km/h (42 miles per second)</li>
    <li><strong>Google search increase for 'planetary defence':</strong> 298% over three months</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025. It approached the Sun, reaching its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025. Throughout this period, scientists monitored its trajectory and chemical composition, concluding that it is a natural comet and not a spacecraft.</p>

<p>NASA has confirmed that this comet is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system, emphasizing that it poses no threat to Earth. Public interest in planetary defence has surged, with significant increases in online searches.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS poses no threat and, at its closest, it will come within just 170 million miles of Earth,” said Sean Duffy, NASA Acting Administrator.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We should be ready for the possibility of a visitor that detected them,” said Abraham ‘Avi’ Loeb, Harvard University astrophysicist. “It may come to save us or destroy us.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS has prompted discussions about planetary defence strategies. Previous missions, such as Voyager 1 and 2, have sent signals into space in hopes of contacting extraterrestrial life. The need for an alert system to monitor and respond to potential threats from space is becoming increasingly urgent.</p>

<p>Experts highlight the difference in risk between comets and asteroids, with comets being less likely to pose a direct threat to Earth. The likelihood of an asteroid impact remains a more pressing concern for scientists and defence agencies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are considering the establishment of an international organisation dedicated to responding to interstellar objects. Discussions about developing an alert system akin to the Richter scale for earthquakes are ongoing, with the aim of enhancing global preparedness for potential extraterrestrial encounters.</p>
