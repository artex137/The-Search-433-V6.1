      <h2>Lara Trump claims Donald has 'some speech' planned on aliens and UFOs</h2>

<p>Lara Trump, the daughter-in-law of former President Donald Trump, has stated that he has drafted a speech about extraterrestrial life and UFOs. She made the comments during an appearance on the New York Post's Pod Force One on Wednesday, October 25, 2023. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this claim.</p>

<p>This statement has drawn attention as it comes amid a renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including the White House, have responded to inquiries regarding the existence of such a speech. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted that the claim was “news to me” but acknowledged that it would be intriguing.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lara Trump made the claim on October 25, 2023.</li>
    <li>The remarks were made during an episode of Pod Force One.</li>
    <li>Karoline Leavitt is the current White House press secretary.</li>
    <li>Former President Barack Obama recently discussed extraterrestrial life in an interview.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 25, 2023, Lara Trump appeared on the New York Post's Pod Force One and claimed that Donald Trump has prepared a speech on aliens and UFOs. She explained that he is waiting for the right moment to deliver it.</p>

<p>Later that day, the White House was contacted for confirmation about the speech. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the speech was “news to me” and expressed interest in the topic.</p>

<p>In a separate event over the weekend, former President Obama openly acknowledged his belief in extraterrestrial life during an interview and addressed conspiracy theories surrounding Area 51.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "We've kind of asked my father-in-law about this... we all want to know about the UFOs... and he played a little coy with us," Lara Trump said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "I'll have to check in with our speech writing team. Uh, and that would be of great interest to me personally, and I'm sure all of you in this room and apparently former President Obama, too," Karoline Leavitt stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "They're real, but I haven't seen them - and they're not being kept in Area 51," Obama remarked during the interview.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This claim comes in a broader context of public fascination with UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Area 51, a well-known military facility in Nevada, has long been associated with conspiracy theories regarding alien technology. In 2013, the CIA acknowledged the facility's existence after decades of secrecy.</p>

<p>Former President Obama's recent comments reflect a shift in governmental transparency regarding UFOs. His acknowledgment of alien life adds to the ongoing discussion and speculation surrounding the topic.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The White House has not provided a timeline for any potential speech by Donald Trump. Further inquiries may arise regarding the implications of such a speech and its timing amidst ongoing discussions of extraterrestrial life.</p>
