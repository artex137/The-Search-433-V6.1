      <h2>Juno’s possible link to 3I/Atlas sparks debate — did NASA miss a rare chance to study the interstellar visitor?</h2>

<p>NASA's Juno spacecraft may have had the opportunity to observe the interstellar object 3I/Atlas as it passed through our solar system earlier this year. The discovery has sparked debate among space enthusiasts about whether NASA missed a unique chance to study the object up close. NASA has not confirmed or denied these claims.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/Atlas lies in its rarity as only the third interstellar object identified, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. Observers are questioning whether Juno's orbit could have allowed it to gather data on this fleeting visitor. Astronomers emphasize that close encounters with such objects provide valuable insights into the formation of planets and stars beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas is approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Hawaii in early 2023.</li>
    <li>Juno has been in orbit around Jupiter since 2016.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar object identified by astronomers.</li>
    <li>Juno’s instruments are primarily designed for studying Jupiter, not distant objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first spotted by the ATLAS telescope in early 2023. Since then, astronomers have monitored its trajectory as it passed through the solar system. Juno has remained in orbit around Jupiter since 2016, focusing on the planet's atmosphere and moons.</p>

<p>As 3I/Atlas approached, some observers speculated that Juno's position might allow it to capture images or data from the interstellar object. However, NASA has not made any official statements regarding the spacecraft's capability to observe 3I/Atlas.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The spacecraft's instruments are designed to look at Jupiter's system. It may not have had the proper gear to collect useful information from that far away,” said Dr. Sarah Milner, a planetary scientist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects are infrequent visitors to our solar system, making each encounter significant for scientific research. The previous interstellar objects, 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov, have provided valuable data about the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from other star systems.</p>

<p>NASA's silence regarding Juno's potential observations of 3I/Atlas has fueled speculation and interest among the public and the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has not indicated whether it will release any information or images related to Juno's possible observations of 3I/Atlas. Meanwhile, astronomers continue to gather data from Earth-based telescopes to analyze the interstellar object.</p>
