      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS's journey may have started long before the Sun even existed: Study</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar comet detected by astronomers, may have originated before the formation of the Sun, according to a study published on arXiv. Researchers have analyzed the comet's trajectory and interactions with stars, concluding that it likely came from the thin disk of the Milky Way Galaxy. The comet was first spotted in late June and confirmed as interstellar by NASA in July 2025.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS could be a relic of the Milky Way, potentially billions of years older than the Sun. Understanding the origins of 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into the early solar system and the conditions that existed in the galaxy at that time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the fastest and largest interstellar comet detected, estimated to be between 3 and 7 miles wide.</li>
    <li>It was first observed in late June and confirmed as an interstellar object by NASA in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has collided with 93 stars, with 62 of those encounters classified as high-confidence.</li>
    <li>The closest significant encounter occurred 72,000 years ago with the star HD 187760, located 84 light-years from Earth.</li>
    <li>Researchers estimate the comet to be approximately 10 billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late June 2025, astronomers first observed 3I/ATLAS. NASA confirmed its status as an interstellar comet in July 2025. Following this, researchers began analyzing its trajectory, focusing on its interactions with other stars.</p>

<p>During their investigation, experts traced the comet’s path over four million years, revealing a complex history of encounters with stars in the Milky Way. They identified a significant encounter with HD 187760 occurring 72,000 years ago, which contributed to their understanding of the comet's origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We integrated the orbit of 3I/ATLAS backward in time for 10 Myr, together with a sample of Gaia DR3 stars with high-quality astrometry and radial velocities, to identify close passages within 2 pc,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, astronomers had detected two other interstellar comets: 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These earlier discoveries have raised questions about the origins and characteristics of interstellar objects, prompting ongoing research into their trajectories and histories.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar comets and their potential to provide insights into the early universe and the formation of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further analyses of 3I/ATLAS’s trajectory and its interactions with other celestial bodies to deepen their understanding of its origins and implications for the study of the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
