      <h2>Shocking New Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS Fuel Alien Spaceship Theory</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, taken on November 9, 2025, have sparked further speculation about its nature, as Harvard scientist Avi Loeb suggests the object may be an alien spacecraft. The photos reveal a large plume of material on one side and emissions on the opposite side, raising questions about its classification as a comet.</p>

<p>The object, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, has captured the attention of scientists and the public alike. Authorities are monitoring its trajectory as it approaches Earth, expected to be nearest in mid-December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of discovery:</strong> Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 140,000 mph relative to the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 325 million miles (approximately 526 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Expected closest approach:</strong> Mid-December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Current trajectory:</strong> Unbound, hyperbolic path past the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS survey telescope on July 1, 2025. Initial observations suggested it was on a highly eccentric path that could bring it close to Earth's orbit. On October 21, 2025, the object was observed by the GOES-19 weather satellite during a solar conjunction.</p>
<p>Recent images taken on November 9, 2025, showed significant emissions from the object, prompting further analysis by scientists, particularly Avi Loeb, who has raised the possibility of technological origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Given these considerations, is 3I/ATLAS of natural or technological origin? Upcoming spectroscopic observations will allow us to determine the velocity, mass flux and composition of its jets and hence answer this foundational question.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System, following 2I/Borisov and 1I/'Oumuamua. Unlike typical comets, 3I/ATLAS has shown unusual behavior, including an unexplained increase in speed after its close approach to the Sun and a lack of visible gas or dust emissions that could account for its acceleration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to conduct spectroscopic observations of 3I/ATLAS to analyze its jets and determine its composition. The findings may provide insights into whether the object is a natural comet or has technological origins.</p>
