      <h2>Leaked video of missile 'smacking into UFO' released during US Congress hearing</h2>

<p>The U.S. Congress held a hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) on Tuesday, September 9, 2025, where a leaked video showed a missile colliding with an unidentified object. The video reportedly captured by an American MQ-9 drone off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024, did not show any apparent damage to the object following the missile strike. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this incident.</p>

<p>This hearing is part of an initiative aimed at increasing transparency regarding UAPs, previously known as UFOs. Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who led the hearing, emphasized the need for the government to provide answers about UAPs and other historical events. The Congress plans to investigate various topics, including the Epstein client list, COVID-19 origins, and the 9/11 files, in addition to UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Date of incident: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Involved agencies: U.S. Congress, U.S. military</li>
    <li>Key witnesses: Representative Anna Paulina Luna, UAP journalist George Knapp, Representative Eric Burlison</li>
    <li>Type of missile: Hellfire missile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an American MQ-9 drone captured footage of an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen. Shortly after, a missile was launched from a second, unseen drone, colliding with the object. The incident was not disclosed to the public until a hearing was held on September 9, 2025, where the video was presented.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Representative Eric Burlison revealed that the footage had been provided to him by a whistleblower. He noted the unusual nature of the event but cautioned against labeling it as extraterrestrial.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The federal government has been hiding information from Americans for decades. It is time to give Americans the answers they deserve, which is why I am honored to lead this bipartisan task force that seeks truth and transparency,” said Representative Anna Paulina Luna.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That’s a hellfire missile smacking into that UFO, and it kept going,” commented UAP journalist George Knapp.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’m not going to speculate what it is, but the question is, why are we being blocked from this information?” asked Representative Eric Burlison.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The hearing on UAPs is part of a broader effort by Congress to address public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena and restore trust in government transparency. Similar incidents have occurred in the past where unidentified objects were later explained, although officials noted that the current evidence for this incident is inconclusive.</p>
<p>Prior to this hearing, there have been various reports of UAPs captured by military personnel, prompting calls for further investigation into these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress plans to conduct further investigations into UAPs and other related incidents. Future hearings may provide additional insights into the government's interest in these phenomena and the reasons for their previous secrecy.</p>
