      <h2>The U.S. Congress: Your Go-To Source for UFO Theater</h2>

<p>On September 9, 2025, Rep. Eric Burlison presented a video to the House Oversight Committee, showing a mysterious orb being struck by a missile from an MQ-9 Reaper drone in Yemen on October 30, 2024. The 50-second clip raised eyebrows but did not result in any injuries or fatalities. The object continued on its path despite the impact, prompting questions about its nature.</p>

<p>This event highlights ongoing congressional interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). Authorities are currently scrutinizing the video and the claims surrounding it, as skepticism grows regarding the authenticity of the evidence presented. The House Oversight Committee has established a Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, led by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, to investigate such matters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video presented on September 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>Drone footage captured on October 30, 2024, off Yemen.</li>
    <li>The object reportedly struck by a Hellfire missile but continued moving.</li>
    <li>Independent analysts have suggested the object may have been a balloon.</li>
    <li>George Knapp, a veteran investigative journalist, provided testimony at the hearing.</li>
    <li>David Grusch, a former intelligence officer, has made claims about UAP cover-ups.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone operating off Yemen recorded footage of an orb being hit by a missile. The video was later presented to the House Oversight Committee by Rep. Eric Burlison on September 9, 2025. Following this, independent analysts began to investigate the footage, suggesting that the object may be a balloon rather than an unexplained phenomenon. Concurrently, the committee has been examining broader claims related to unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is not governance. It is viral marketing disguised as oversight,” said an unnamed source regarding the committee's handling of the UFO testimony.</blockquote>
<blockquote>George Knapp emphasized, “Credentials have come to substitute for evidence,” during his testimony about UFO cases.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first instance of the U.S. government engaging with UFO mythology. Reports from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations in the late 1970s indicate that false information was disseminated to distract from classified activities. More recently, the “Yankee Blue” scandal involved Air Force commanders misleading new officers with doctored UFO images.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The House Oversight Committee continues to evaluate the claims made during the hearings while independent analysts work to verify the authenticity of the presented footage. Future sessions may address the credibility of witnesses and the nature of the evidence submitted.</p>
