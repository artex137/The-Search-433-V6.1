      <h2>Flying saucers seen over Washington DC in the 1950s spotted in old photos</h2>

<p>Evidence of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) may have emerged from a study of photographs taken in the 1950s, particularly during a notable incident over Washington DC on July 27, 1952. Researchers have detected mysterious flashes of light in images captured before the Space Age, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it may offer insights into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and their potential origins. Authorities are now examining the findings closely, as they could challenge our understanding of aerial events in history. The study is part of the VASCO project, led by Beatriz Villarroel at Nordita, Stockholm University.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study period: 1951–1957</li>
    <li>Location: Palomar Observatory, California</li>
    <li>Event date: July 27, 1952</li>
    <li>Number of photographic plates examined: over 100,000</li>
    <li>Research team leader: Beatriz Villarroel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the early 1950s, scientists began capturing images of the night sky at Palomar Observatory. The VASCO project, initiated by Beatriz Villarroel, focused on identifying 'transients'—points of light that appear briefly in photographic records. On July 27, 1952, a cluster of UFO sightings occurred over Washington DC, coinciding with the analysis of these photographs.</p>

<p>The research team filtered through more than 100,000 photographic candidates and discovered intriguing patterns that suggest the presence of flat, reflective objects in high orbit, rather than conventional meteors or space debris. These findings have raised questions about the nature of the observed phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What we discovered is quite intriguing,” said Villarroel. “The pattern aligns with flat, highly reflective objects in high orbit, not round space rocks or dust.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study adds to a growing body of research into UAPs and their characteristics. The 1952 sightings over Washington DC have been a focal point for UFO enthusiasts and researchers alike. The findings may also correlate with theories regarding unexplained atmospheric effects, particularly those linked to nuclear detonations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the origins of the observed phenomena will continue as researchers delve deeper into the data and examine the implications of their findings on our understanding of aerial events during the pre-Sputnik era. Further studies may be conducted to explore unidentified reflective objects and their potential connections to known atmospheric effects.</p>
