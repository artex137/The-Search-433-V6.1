      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS to Make Close Approach to Earth on December 19</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023, offering astronomers a rare opportunity to study the interstellar object. The comet, which is the third large interstellar visitor discovered, has been on a journey through the Milky Way for billions of years.</p>

<p>This close approach is significant for astronomers as it allows for detailed observations of the comet's features. According to Darryl Z. Seligman, an Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan State University, the event provides a chance to compare the formation of exoplanets with that of our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Closest approach of Comet 3I/ATLAS to Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Opportunity for detailed astronomical observations</li>
    <li><strong>Research Focus:</strong> Comparison of comet formation in different planetary systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023, marking the third large interstellar object found. Since its discovery, astronomers have monitored its trajectory and characteristics. The comet is expected to be at its closest to Earth on December 19, just days before Christmas, enhancing visibility for amateur astronomers.</p>

<p>This event follows the discovery of the first known interstellar object, 1I/'Oumuamua, in 2017 and the second, 2I/Borisov, in 2019. Both previous discoveries have provided insights into the composition and origins of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS is giving us a new window to put our solar system into its cosmic context this Christmas,” said Darryl Z. Seligman.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In the past seven years, astronomers have identified three members of a new population of celestial bodies known as interstellar objects. These objects have hyperbolic orbits, indicating they originate from outside our solar system. The discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS adds to the understanding of how comets and planetary systems may differ across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to gather data on its composition and trajectory. Observations during this close encounter may provide critical insights into the formation processes of both solar and exoplanetary systems.</p>
