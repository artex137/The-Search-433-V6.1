      <h2>Soviet X-Files investigated 'jellyfish' UFO that hovered above city in the 1980s</h2>

<p>A 'jellyfish' UFO, described as a massive airborne object topped with flashing multicolored lights, hovered above Nalchik, Russia, for over an hour on February 13, 1989, before disappearing. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the incident.</p>

<p>This incident is part of a recently released collection of Soviet-era files that detail how authorities in the former USSR documented unexplained aerial phenomena. The files, smuggled out of Russia in the early 1990s and converted to English by journalist George Knapp, provide insight into how Soviet agencies catalogued what they referred to as 'Abnormal Atmospheric Phenomena' during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident Date: February 13, 1989</li>
    <li>Location: Nalchik, Russia</li>
    <li>Duration of UFO sighting: Over 1 hour</li>
    <li>Document collection size: Approximately 70 pages</li>
    <li>Released by: Journalist George Knapp</li>
    <li>Period of documentation: 1970s and 1980s</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 13, 1989, observers in Nalchik reported seeing a jellyfish-shaped object in the sky. The object reportedly remained visible for over an hour before vanishing. Additional reports from the same period detailed bright streaks in the sky and encounters with humanoid beings.</p>
<p>Earlier, in 1979, campers in Kazakhstan reported sightings of tall, dark silhouettes near a forest, but no physical evidence was found to support these claims.</p>
<p>The documents reveal that Soviet authorities collected testimonies from civilians, military personnel, and technical experts but refrained from confirming the nature of the sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The records reference observations reported by civilians, military personnel, and technical experts, along with protocols for gathering statements, documenting reports, and evaluating potential explanations,” Knapp said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The released documents indicate a systematic approach to monitoring unexplained aerial phenomena, despite the Soviet government publicly ridiculing the idea of extraterrestrial visitors as Western propaganda. Many entries suggest Earth-based explanations, such as atmospheric phenomena or equipment malfunctions, but some files consider the possibility of foreign technology, particularly during the Cold War.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The release of these files may prompt further investigations into similar sightings and could lead to renewed interest in the study of unexplained aerial phenomena in Russia and beyond.</p>
