      <h2>Comet? UFO? Astronomers puzzle over fastest object in solar system</h2>

<p>Just after midnight on July 1, astronomers in Massachusetts announced the discovery of an interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, that is travelling at 118,000 miles per hour, making it the fastest object ever recorded in the solar system. The announcement came from the Minor Planet Center, based at Harvard University, as data from a telescope in Chile revealed a spark in the southern sky.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it marks only the third interstellar object ever detected passing through the solar system. Scientists are examining the object’s unusual characteristics, with some suggesting it could be a comet while others, including Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, propose it might be an alien probe. Authorities, including the Minor Planet Center, are monitoring its trajectory and sharing findings in real time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 118,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Time:</strong> 1:15 AM local time on July 1</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Will not come within 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 29</li>
    <li><strong>Size Estimate:</strong> Between 200 and 5,000 meters across</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Objects:</strong> Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, at 1:15 AM local time, the Minor Planet Center announced the sighting of 3I/Atlas. Within hours, astronomers around the world began to observe the object using their telescopes. On July 2, Avi Loeb appeared on a late-night radio show, where he learned from a listener about the potential new object.</p>

<p>Loeb subsequently began posting essays discussing the characteristics of 3I/Atlas, which have garnered significant attention, receiving a quarter of a million views. He raised questions about the object’s trajectory and its implications for the possibility of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We at the Minor Planet Center have the role to collect the information and also to post it quickly, almost in real time, on our website if the object is somehow interesting.” 
    <cite>—Peter Veres, Harvard astronomer</cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Can you believe it? It’s not a TikTok video. These are essays of 1,000 words or more.” 
    <cite>—Avi Loeb on the attention his essays have received</cite>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas follows the detection of two previous interstellar objects, Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Oumuamua sparked debate over its classification and origin, with Loeb suggesting it could be an alien solar sail. In contrast, Borisov behaved more like a traditional comet, providing a clearer understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>Current theories about 3I/Atlas focus on its lack of a dust trail and its unusual trajectory, which some astronomers find compelling yet inconclusive regarding alien technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches the sun. Further observations are planned as it nears its closest approach, and researchers will analyze its behaviour to determine its nature and origin.</p>
