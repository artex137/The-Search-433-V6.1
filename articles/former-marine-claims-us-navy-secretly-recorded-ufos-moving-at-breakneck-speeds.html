      <h2>Former Marine Claims US Navy Secretly Recorded UFOs Moving at Breakneck Speeds</h2>

<p>A former submarine employee has claimed that the US Navy has maintained secret logs documenting unidentified objects moving at high speeds through oceans. The allegations surfaced as the US government released a report detailing 21 unexplained cases of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), commonly referred to as UFOs. The report was submitted to Congress by the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).</p>

<p>This matter draws attention due to the ongoing investigation into UAPs and the implications for national security and scientific inquiry. The AARO has indicated that it is working closely with the intelligence community to analyze these cases.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Claims made by a former submarine employee known as Dabier.</li>
    <li>The AARO has documented 21 unexplained UAP cases.</li>
    <li>Some UAP sightings include descriptions of green fireballs and a multi-colored “jellyfish” object.</li>
    <li>Not all cases have been resolved; some remain unexplained.</li>
    <li>Reports have been submitted to Congress regarding UAP investigations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The allegations by Dabier emerged following a discussion about government tracking of unidentified objects. He stated that a retired sonar expert from the Cold War era confirmed the existence of a special log for tracking unidentified contacts. The AARO's report to Congress highlights 21 cases of UAPs, some of which have been investigated but remain unexplained.</p>

<p>Notably, the report includes well-known incidents such as the "GOFAST" footage, which shows a US Navy F/A-18 fighter jet interacting with a UAP, and a silver sphere filmed by a US drone in the Middle East. The AARO has stressed that it has found no evidence of extraterrestrial technologies.</p>

<blockquote>
    “None of the resolved cases have proven advanced alien adversary capabilities or revolutionary aerial technology,” the report stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous investigations into UAPs have produced mixed results, with some sightings explained as balloons, birds, or satellites. However, a significant number of incidents remain unresolved, prompting ongoing scrutiny and analysis by authorities. The AARO's report marks a continued effort to understand these phenomena and their implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO has pledged to notify Congress immediately if any cases indicate new technological advances by foreign powers. It continues to analyze the 21 UAP cases in collaboration with the intelligence community and scientific partners.</p>
