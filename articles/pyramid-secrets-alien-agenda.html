      <h2>Pyramid Secrets / Alien Agenda</h2>

<p>Researcher Captain Leo Walton has presented his thesis on the Great Pyramid of Giza during a program hosted by Richard Syrett, claiming it was not a tomb but an advanced energy-generating machine. Walton's findings, shared on September 13, 2025, suggest the pyramid operated as a plasma generator, contradicting conventional views of its purpose.</p>

<p>Walton's research matters as it challenges long-held beliefs about ancient Egyptian architecture and its functions. His theories prompt further investigation into historical energy systems and their implications for understanding ancient civilizations. The program also featured Tyler Gilreath, who explored early American interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life, suggesting that this curiosity extends back to the nation's founders.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: September 13, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Researcher: Captain Leo Walton</li>
    <li>Program host: Richard Syrett</li>
    <li>Key topic: Great Pyramid as an energy-generating machine</li>
    <li>Secondary topic: Historical references to UFOs by America's founders</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the program, Captain Leo Walton detailed the evolution of his thesis over decades. He initially proposed that the Great Pyramid produced hydrogen gas but later refined his theory to assert that it generated plasma. Walton cited specific architectural features and materials that could support his claims.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the program, Tyler Gilreath discussed early American leaders' speculations about extraterrestrial life. He highlighted significant historical events, including a 1796 memorial for astronomer David Rittenhouse, where discussions about extraterrestrial civilizations took place.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The pyramids were built to create plasma and scalar energy,” Walton stated, linking findings from Bosnia to his claims.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It is remarkable that the founding generation treated extraterrestrial hypotheses as political, scientific, and spiritual issues,” Gilreath noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Walton's claims align with a growing interest in ancient technologies and their potential applications. His research builds on previous analyses by Christopher Dunn and others who have challenged traditional interpretations of ancient structures. Gilreath's findings add historical depth to modern UFO discussions, showcasing that curiosity about alien life has deep roots in American history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into Walton's theories and the historical context of UFO interest among America's founders are expected. Both researchers may publish additional findings that could influence public understanding of ancient technologies and extraterrestrial life.</p>
