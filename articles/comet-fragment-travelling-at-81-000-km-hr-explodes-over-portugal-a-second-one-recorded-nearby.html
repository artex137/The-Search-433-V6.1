      <h2>Comet fragment travelling at 81,000 km/hr explodes over Portugal, a second one recorded nearby</h2>

<p>A piece of a comet has exploded over Portugal on November 2, 2025, at 8:41 pm local time, according to the meteor detection station Casas de Millán in Cáceres, Spain. The explosion created a bright flash of light, but there have been no reports of injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights the capabilities of the European Space Agency’s Planetary Defence Office in monitoring cosmic events. The explosion occurred tens of kilometres above the ground, illuminating the skies over the Iberian Peninsula. The Southwestern Europe Meteor Network (SWEMN – IAA-CSIC) indicated that the cometary fragment's entry coincided with ongoing meteor showers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: November 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Time of explosion: 8:41 pm local time</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Lousã, central Portugal</li>
    <li>Altitude of entry: 97 kilometres</li>
    <li>Altitude of explosion: 43 kilometres</li>
    <li>Speed of comet fragment: 81,000 kilometres per hour</li>
    <li>Agency involved: European Space Agency’s Planetary Defence Office</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet fragment was first recorded entering Earth's atmosphere at an altitude of 97 kilometres above Lousã, Portugal. It travelled approximately 80 kilometres through the atmosphere before exploding at an altitude of 43 kilometres.</p>

<p>During this event, a second meteor was also detected nearby. However, authorities believe the two bolides are unrelated due to their differing trajectories.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The cometary fragment got caught when Earth was there,” said a representative from the Southwestern Europe Meteor Network. “Bolides can fall down at this time since there are some meteor showers going on.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The explosion of the comet fragment coincided with the peak of the Southern Taurids meteor shower, which is currently visible in the night sky. Upcoming meteor showers, including the Northern Taurids and the Leonid Meteor Shower, are also expected to occur soon.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor the skies for further meteor activity as the meteor shower events progress. Investigations into the specifics of the explosions may also take place, though further details have not been disclosed.</p>
