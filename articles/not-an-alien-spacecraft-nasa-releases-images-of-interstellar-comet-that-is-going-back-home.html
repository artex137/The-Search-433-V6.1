      <h2>Not an alien spacecraft: Nasa releases images of interstellar comet that is going back home</h2>

<p>Nasa has released close-up images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently about 190 million miles from Earth. The images were captured in Manciano, Italy, and show the comet making a single pass through the solar system. The comet was first discovered in July 2025 and has been photographed multiple times since then.</p>

<p>This release is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet confirmed to have entered our solar system. Nasa officials have indicated that the comet will be visible to sky watchers from Earth in the predawn sky with the use of binoculars or telescopes. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, at a distance of 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 1,444 feet to 3.5 miles in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently about 190 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>It was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Images were taken in Manciano, Italy.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, at 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>ESA’s JUICE spacecraft has been observing the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. In early August, images were released showing the comet from a distance of 277 million miles. A month ago, two Mars orbiters captured images of the comet when it was 18.6 million miles from Mars. The latest images were taken in November 2025, as Nasa continues to track its path.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches Earth, Nasa’s acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, stated that astronomers are eager to observe it through telescopes. The comet is expected to be a unique opportunity for both scientists and sky gazers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Shawn Domagal-Goldman</strong>, Nasa’s acting astrophysics director: “Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it’s a fascinating and rare opportunity.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Tom Statler</strong>, NASA scientist: “That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it’s a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar comet confirmed to have entered the solar system. Its fast movement and potential origin from an older star system provide valuable insights into the formation of celestial bodies and the history of our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The comet will continue its trajectory towards its closest approach on December 19. Observations from ESA’s JUICE spacecraft will be received in February, as its main antenna is currently being used as a heat shield while near the Sun.</p>
