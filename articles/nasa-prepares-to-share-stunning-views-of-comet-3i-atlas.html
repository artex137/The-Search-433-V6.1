      <h2>NASA prepares to share stunning views of comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA will host a live event at 3 p.m. EST on Wednesday, November 19, to present imagery of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, collected by multiple NASA missions. The event will take place at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and will be streamed on various platforms including NASA+, the NASA app, the agency’s website, YouTube, and Amazon Prime.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object to enter our solar system from another part of the galaxy. The comet poses no threat to Earth, passing at a distance of no closer than 170 million miles, and it flew within 19 million miles of Mars in early October. NASA's continuous observation capabilities allow scientists to study the comet's behavior closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> Wednesday, November 19</li>
    <li><strong>Event Time:</strong> 3 p.m. EST</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> No closer than 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> 19 million miles in early October</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1 by NASA-funded ATLAS observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1 by the ATLAS observatory, which is funded by NASA. In early October, the comet made its closest approach to Mars, passing within 19 million miles. NASA has since utilized its spacecraft and ground-based observatories to continuously monitor the comet's behavior.</p>

<p>The upcoming live event on November 19 will showcase the findings and imagery collected during this observation period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA assets give the United States the unique capability to observe 3I/ATLAS almost the entire time it passes through our celestial neighborhood,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA Associate Administrator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This event will feature key scientists who will discuss how the comet behaves using complementary scientific instruments,” stated Nicky Fox, Science Mission Directorate Associate Administrator.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object identified in our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and comet Borisov. The ability to study such objects provides valuable insight into the composition of other solar systems.</p>

<p>The ongoing monitoring of 3I/ATLAS represents a collaborative effort among various NASA missions, enhancing our understanding of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the live event, NASA will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS to better understand its characteristics and behavior as it travels through our solar system.</p>
