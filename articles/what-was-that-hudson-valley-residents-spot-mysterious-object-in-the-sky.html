      <h2>‘What Was That?!’ Hudson Valley Residents Spot Mysterious Object in the Sky</h2>

<p>A strange object was seen spinning across the Hudson Valley on the night of November 4th, 2025. Residents reported sightings around 6 p.m. after sunset, with many capturing the object on video. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event has sparked curiosity among residents and prompted discussions about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the area. Authorities have confirmed that the object was not a UFO, but rather Europe’s Ariane 6 rocket, which launched earlier that day.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 4, 2025, Hector Lopez filmed an object spinning in the sky at approximately 6 p.m. Residents across multiple counties in the Hudson Valley reported similar sightings. Earlier that day, at 4:02 p.m. EST, the Ariane 6 rocket successfully launched from Kourou, French Guiana, carrying the Sentinel-1D satellite.</p>

<p>Following the sightings, speculation arose regarding the nature of the object, with some suggesting it could be aliens or commercial space vehicles. However, it was confirmed by Space.com that the object was indeed the Ariane 6 rocket.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“My team is delighted to complete this key milestone for this groundbreaking mission,” said Ramon Torres, Sentinel-1 Project Manager. “It’s the culmination of many years of excellent work to ensure that Sentinel-1 will continue generating high-quality radar images and data responding to the key scientific questions and challenges we face today.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
