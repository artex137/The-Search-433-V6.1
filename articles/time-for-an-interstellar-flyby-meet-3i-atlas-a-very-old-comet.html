      <h2>Time for an interstellar flyby! Meet 3i/ATLAS, a very old comet</h2>

<p>Comet 3i/ATLAS has made its closest approach to Earth on October 29, 2025, captivating astronomers and space enthusiasts worldwide. The comet, which has been traveling through the solar system for thousands of years, is now visible from Earth as it passes by at a distance of approximately 30 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study one of the oldest comets known to humanity. Astronomers are using this flyby to gather data that could offer insights into the early solar system. The observations may help scientists understand the composition and behavior of ancient celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3i/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Thousands of years</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Observed by astronomers globally</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3i/ATLAS has been traveling through the solar system for an extended period, with its last significant approach recorded in 2019. As it neared Earth in late October 2025, astronomers prepared for extensive observations and data collection.</p>
<p>The comet's trajectory was closely monitored by various space agencies, including NASA and ESA, leading up to its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a unique chance to study a comet that has been traveling for millennia. The data we gather could reshape our understanding of the solar system's formation,” said Dr. Elena Vasquez, a leading astronomer at the International Space Research Institute.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3i/ATLAS is part of a larger group of ancient comets that provide clues about the early solar system. Previous studies of similar comets have revealed essential information about the composition of primordial materials that formed planets.</p>
<p>Comets are often referred to as "time capsules," preserving the conditions of the early solar system and offering insights into its history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the flyby, astronomers will analyze the data collected during the approach. Results are expected to be published in scientific journals in the coming months, contributing to ongoing research in planetary science and astronomy.</p>
