      <h2>An Autumn of Comets: Observing Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Skywatchers around the world are preparing for a unique opportunity to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion in late October 2023. The comet, our Solar System's third known interstellar visitor, will be visible in September before becoming obscured by the Sun's glare. The global Unistellar community has mobilized to track its brightness changes during this period.</p>

<p>This event matters because it offers a rare glimpse of an interstellar object, and it encourages citizen scientists to contribute to observations and data collection. The Unistellar community has actively engaged in monitoring the comet's brightness, providing valuable insights into its trajectory and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor to our Solar System.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is expected to occur in late October 2023.</li>
    <li>Visibility for observers will change, with a focus on September and November.</li>
    <li>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) will reach its closest approach to Earth on October 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) will have perihelion on October 8, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet K1 is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on November 26, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 2023, Comet 3I/ATLAS will be observable before it becomes obscured by the Sun. Its perihelion will occur in late October, and it will return to visibility in November, particularly for southern hemisphere observers. Following Comet 3I/ATLAS, Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) will become a focal point in late October.</p>

<p>On October 8, 2023, Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) will reach perihelion. Observers will then check its status in November to determine if it survived its close encounter with the Sun, with a close approach to Earth expected on November 26, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “September is a fleeting chance to spot this rare object before it slips away temporarily,” said a representative from the Unistellar community.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Your observations will help answer the question, ‘Did the comet survive perihelion?’” noted José Donas, a citizen astronomer involved in tracking the comets.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This autumn marks a significant period for comet observation, as multiple comets will be visible in succession. The Unistellar community emphasizes the importance of citizen contributions to astronomy, fostering engagement and collaboration among amateur astronomers worldwide.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers are encouraged to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS throughout September and prepare for the subsequent comets in October and November. The Unistellar community will continue to share updates and findings from observers globally.</p>
