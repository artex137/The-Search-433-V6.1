      <h2>Congress to Hold Hearing This Week on UFOs, Demanding ‘Maximum Transparency’</h2>

<p>The House Oversight and Government Reform’s Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets will hold a hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) at 10 a.m. ET on Tuesday. The session will feature testimony from military veterans who claim to have encountered these objects, as well as a journalist who has reported extensively on the issue.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it aims to address government transparency regarding UAPs, specifically focusing on disclosures from the Pentagon and protections for whistleblowers. Representative Anna Paulina Luna, chairwoman of the task force, has stated that the public deserves to know about sightings and potential threats posed by UAPs. She has also emphasized the importance of safeguarding whistleblowers who provide critical information.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date and time: Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET</li>
    <li>Location: House Oversight and Government Reform Committee</li>
    <li>Task force chair: Representative Anna Paulina Luna (Republican, Florida)</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Air Force veterans Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Dylan Borland, Navy veteran Alexandro Wiggins, journalist George Knapp</li>
    <li>Focus: Pentagon disclosures, whistleblower protection, effectiveness of the Department of Defense’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The upcoming hearing follows a similar session held last fall by a different House Oversight subcommittee, where witnesses testified about government withholding of information on UFO cases dating back decades. In a notable 2023 hearing, three military veterans provided testimony regarding a secure process for pilots to report UAP sightings. Retired Major David Grusch, a former member of the UAP Task Force, made allegations regarding the federal government's possession of “non-human” biological matter and technology from unidentified craft.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been a growing push from whistleblowers and Congress members for more transparency about UAPs. This movement has gained traction with the Pentagon's release of videos showing encounters with UAPs, such as the “Tic Tac” video from 2004, which depicted a Navy pilot's encounter with an object performing unusual maneuvers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>“The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans’ safety,” said Representative Anna Paulina Luna.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Whistleblowers who provide details on spending information and policies and procedures regarding the classification and declassification of UAPs should be able to do so without retribution,” she added.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Public interest in UAPs has increased, particularly due to the rise of sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles, like drones, which have added a national security dimension to sightings. The conversation around UAPs has gained credibility, partly due to military pilot video releases. In December 2024, numerous drone sightings were reported in New Jersey, leading local officials, including Governor Phil Murphy, to take these incidents seriously.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The upcoming hearing will likely influence ongoing investigations into UAPs and government transparency. It is expected to address the effectiveness of current policies and the need for further disclosures regarding UAP encounters.</p>
