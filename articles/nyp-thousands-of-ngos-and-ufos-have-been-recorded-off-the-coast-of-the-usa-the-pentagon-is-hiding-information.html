      <h2>Thousands of UFOs Recorded Off US Coast, Pentagon Responds</h2>

<p>Thousands of sightings of unidentified underwater objects (NGOs) have been recorded off the US coast near shipping lanes, according to a report by The New York Post. Senior representatives of the US Navy have stated that these objects may pose a threat to national security.</p>

<p>This issue has gained attention as Enigma, a database tracking UFO sightings, reports over 30,000 unidentified flying objects and unidentified anomalous phenomena since its launch in late 2022. The Pentagon has verified footage showing objects moving underwater without producing any splashes, raising concerns among officials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enigma has recorded over 30,000 UFO sightings since late 2022.</li>
    <li>More than 9,000 mysterious sightings have occurred within 10 miles of the US coastline.</li>
    <li>California has reported 389 sightings; Florida has 306 sightings.</li>
    <li>Over 150 reports describe objects hovering over or descending into waterways.</li>
    <li>In July 2019, a UFO was recorded by the US Navy destroyer Omaha off the coast of San Diego.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2019, the US Navy destroyer Omaha recorded a UFO that disappeared into the ocean after flying over the naval fleet. This incident was verified by the Pentagon, highlighting concerns about maritime security.</p>

<p>Since the launch of Enigma at the end of 2022, the platform has compiled reports of thousands of UFO sightings, with a significant number occurring near US coastlines.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“UFOs capable of moving from air to water without crashing or even making a fuss can have worldwide consequences,” said retired Rear Admiral of the US Navy Tim Gallaudet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Gallaudet emphasized that these phenomena could endanger the maritime security of the United States, which is already weakened by a lack of knowledge about the oceans.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings are often dismissed by the scientific community as implausible. However, the recent reports have drawn renewed interest, especially following the verification of incidents by the Pentagon.</p>

<p>In his 29-page report for the Sol Foundation, which focuses on UFOs, Gallaudet outlined a documented reporting system for these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the sightings are ongoing, with authorities examining the implications for national security. The Pentagon is likely to continue monitoring these phenomena closely, given their potential impact. Further updates are expected as more information becomes available.</p>
