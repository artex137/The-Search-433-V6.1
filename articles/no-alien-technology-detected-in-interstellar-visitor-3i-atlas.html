      <h2>No Alien Technology Detected in Interstellar Visitor 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Scientists have concluded that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows no evidence of extraterrestrial technology, following a comprehensive radio search conducted by the Breakthrough Listen program. The findings, released on December 18, 2025, confirm the comet's classification as a natural cosmic body rather than an alien artifact.</p>

<p>This conclusion is significant as it dispels earlier speculations regarding the comet's origin. Authorities, including NASA, have emphasized that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the view that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a typical comet. Ongoing observations continue to enhance our understanding of such interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>It has a diameter estimated between <strong>440 meters</strong> and <strong>5.6 kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet's perihelion occurred on October 30, 2025, at a distance of about <strong>210 million kilometers</strong> from the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately <strong>270 million kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>The Green Bank Telescope conducted the radio search on December 18, 2025, scanning frequencies from <strong>1 to 12 gigahertz</strong>.</li>
    <li>No artificial signals stronger than <strong>0.1 watts</strong> were detected from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet's unique trajectory indicated it was not bound by the Sun's gravity, suggesting it originated from another star system. Observations on August 20, 2025, by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope revealed its icy nucleus and cometary characteristics.</p>

<p>The comet approached the Sun on October 30, 2025, reaching speeds of approximately <strong>246,000 kilometers per hour</strong>. It passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about <strong>270 million kilometers</strong>. A rigorous search for alien signals was conducted by the Breakthrough Listen initiative on December 18, 2025, just before this closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All evidence points to it being a comet,” said Amit Kshatriya, Associate Administrator at NASA. “We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Chris Lintott, a University of Oxford astrophysicist, described the notion of an artificial origin as “simply nonsense.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to a growing list of interstellar objects, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Initial speculations about the comet's origin were partly fueled by prominent voices in the scientific community, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. However, as more data emerged, including the development of a tail, the scientific consensus shifted toward a natural explanation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue with various telescopes, including Hubble and James Webb. These efforts aim to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their role in planetary formation. The comet is expected to remain observable from Earth until spring 2026 before fading into space.</p>
