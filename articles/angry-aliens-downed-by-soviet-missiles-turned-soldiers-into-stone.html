      <h2>Angry aliens downed by Soviet missiles 'turned soldiers into stone'</h2>

<p>A 1993 incident in Siberia has surfaced, detailing how Soviet troops reportedly shot down a UFO, resulting in 23 soldiers being turned to stone. The event involved a surface-to-air missile and occurred during military operations, with only a few survivors remaining to recount the bizarre encounter.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it raises questions about the authenticity of UFO sightings and the extent to which Soviet authorities documented such occurrences. Recent disclosures have indicated that the Soviet Union maintained records of unidentified aerial phenomena, despite public dismissals of these reports as Western propaganda.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in 1993 over Siberia.</li>
    <li>23 soldiers were reportedly turned into stone.</li>
    <li>Five alien beings emerged from the downed craft.</li>
    <li>Two soldiers survived the incident.</li>
    <li>The remains were allegedly sent to a secret research facility near Moscow.</li>
    <li>Incident noted in a declassified CIA file and a Ukrainian newspaper report.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1993, Soviet troops engaged a UFO with a surface-to-air missile. Following the missile strike, five alien beings exited the wreckage and fused into a single orb. This orb emitted a beam of light, which instantly petrified 23 soldiers nearby.</p>

<p>Only two soldiers survived the encounter, reportedly due to their lesser exposure to the light. The incident was later documented in a Ukrainian newspaper, which cited leaks from the KGB, and caught the attention of the CIA, who included it in their files.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If accurate, it would reveal a highly advanced alien technology that poses a significant threat if provoked,” noted the CIA file, referencing the Ukrainian report.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this incident, the Soviet Union had a history of dismissing UFO reports as mere fabrications. However, newly released documents from the era show that the Soviet military catalogued what they termed 'Abnormal Atmospheric Phenomena' during the 1970s and 1980s, indicating a level of concern and interest in unexplained aerial occurrences.</p>

<p>A notable entry from February 13, 1989, describes a large aerial object over Nalchik, Russia, which remained visible for over an hour before disappearing. This entry, along with the 1993 incident, reflects the ongoing mystery surrounding UFO sightings in the region.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the validity of the 1993 incident continue, with researchers examining the declassified CIA files and other related documents. No formal charges or actions have been reported regarding the incident, and further disclosures from Russian authorities may shed light on the event.</p>
