      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas displays a luminous pulse every 16 hours as it approaches Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has shown a cyclical variation in brightness every 16 hours as it approaches Earth, with a close pass expected on December 19, 2025. NASA confirmed that the comet will come within approximately 274 million kilometers of Earth without any risk of collision.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it provides insights into the comet's structure and behavior. Astronomers at the ATLAS observatory in Hawaii have detected this pattern since October 2025, observing that the comet’s brightness fluctuates due to its rapid rotation and sublimation of frozen compounds. The study of 3I/Atlas could enhance understanding of the formation of planetary systems beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will pass Earth at a distance of 1.83 AU (274 million kilometers) on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits brightness variation every 16 hours.</li>
    <li>Its nucleus is approximately 3 to 5 kilometers in diameter and is estimated to be over 8 billion years old.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a hyperbolic speed of approximately 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>It has shown jets of water vapor, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>The best observation window for the comet is after midnight, looking east.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered on June 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system. Astronomers began observing its brightness pattern in October 2025. NASA has released multiple images showing the comet's increasing activity leading up to its close approach to Earth.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, and will leave the solar system after perihelion on December 31, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The brightness varies almost identically in each cycle, something rare in natural objects,” said Avi Loeb, professor of astrophysics at Harvard University. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There is no evidence of artificiality,” NASA stated regarding the comet's unusual features.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects. Its behavior is similar to that of hyperactive comets like 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The unique composition of 3I/Atlas, with molecules rarely seen in solar system comets, has sparked debate among scientists regarding its origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations and studies will continue as the comet approaches Earth. NASA and ESA have proposed missions to intercept interstellar objects in the next decade, which could further enhance the understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>
