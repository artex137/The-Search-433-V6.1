      <h2>X-Ray Glow Around 3I/ATLAS Is Too Bright: Is The 250,000-Mile Cloud An Error?</h2>

<p>Scientists have discovered a massive X-ray cloud surrounding interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which extends approximately 400,000 kilometres (about 250,000 miles) around its nucleus. The findings were made between November 26 and November 28, 2023, by the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), a project led by Japan's JAXA with contributions from NASA and ESA.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it challenges existing assumptions about cometary behaviour and formation. The unusual size and characteristics of the X-ray cloud may provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects and their interactions with solar winds. Researchers are now working to understand the implications of these findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has an X-ray cloud measuring 400,000 kilometres (250,000 miles).</li>
    <li>The discovery was made by XRISM between November 26 and November 28, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently moving away from the Sun at over 210,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>This is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, and has since been classified as a comet due to its active gas and dust emissions. Between November 26 and November 28, 2023, the XRISM mission detected an unprecedented X-ray glow surrounding the comet, prompting further investigation into its properties and implications.</p>

<p>The comet is now observable in the pre-dawn sky and is on a hyperbolic trajectory out of the solar system, necessitating quick data collection by scientists before it becomes unobservable.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sheer size and structure of this ethereal, glowing halo are challenging every assumption astronomers have made about these cosmic wanderers,” said a representative from the XRISM team.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Understanding the interaction between the comet's 'alien' gas and our local solar wind is vital,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of X-ray emissions from comets has been documented since 1996, with Comet Hyakutake being one of the earliest examples. However, 3I/ATLAS is unique as it originates from a distant star system, presenting a different chemical composition and interaction with solar winds than previously observed comets.</p>

<p>This observation offers a rare opportunity to study the formation of icy worlds beyond our solar neighbourhood, shedding light on the conditions in which these objects form.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are currently processing the data obtained from XRISM to confirm the origins of the X-ray structure. They aim to distinguish the comet's actual behaviour from any potential instrument effects before 3I/ATLAS becomes too distant to study.</p>
