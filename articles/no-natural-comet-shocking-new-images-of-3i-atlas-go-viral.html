      <h2>'No Natural Comet': Shocking New Images of 3I/ATLAS Go Viral</h2>

<p>New images of comet 3I/ATLAS have gone viral, capturing the attention of astronomers and social media users since their release yesterday. The comet, the third known interstellar visitor, displays a striking green glow and an unusual 'anti-tail' that points toward the Sun, sparking debate about its true nature.</p>

<p>The viral images have raised questions among scientists about whether 3I/ATLAS is a typical comet. Authorities and astronomers are investigating its unusual features, which have prompted discussions on social media about the object's composition and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor ever recorded.</li>
    <li>Images were shared widely on social media starting December 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits a green anti-tail and a blue tail, with claims of nickel ions contributing to its colour.</li>
    <li>Observations from the Keck Observatory indicate a high concentration of nickel emissions around the comet's nucleus.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres across.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Images of comet 3I/ATLAS first appeared during a lunar eclipse, prompting initial speculation about its colour. Astronomers suggested that the green hue might be due to diatomic carbon (C₂), a molecule that fluoresces in sunlight. However, subsequent spectroscopic observations revealed that 3I/ATLAS lacks the typical carbon-chain molecules associated with the green glow.</p>

<p>Recent data from telescopes have indicated that the unusual green glow may originate from nickel vapour detected in the comet's coma. Furthermore, researchers have noted that the comet's tail orientation exhibits an 'anti-solar' direction, which deviates from standard comet behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “There is no ‘natural comet’ explanation that survives these observations,” said a researcher involved in the study of 3I/ATLAS. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have drawn comparisons to previous interstellar objects, but its distinctive features have not been observed in any other known comet. The debate surrounding its classification reflects ongoing research in the field of astronomy regarding the nature of interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through our Solar System. Further observations and analyses are expected to clarify the comet's characteristics and provide insights into its composition.</p>
