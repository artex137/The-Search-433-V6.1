      <h2>Comets were on fire this year – for better or worse</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has captured public attention in 2025, alongside other notable comets like Lemmon and C/2025 R2 (SWAN), as scientists and astronomers have closely studied these celestial bodies throughout the year. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to these comets.</p>

<p>This year’s comet sightings have sparked interest in the scientific community and among the public, prompting discussions about the significance of such interstellar objects. Authorities and researchers are analyzing data from these comets to better understand their origins and compositions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is an interstellar comet, distinct from others due to its origin outside the solar system.</li>
    <li>Comet Lemmon was discovered in January 2025 and remained in the news for nine months.</li>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was visible even near the moon on Halloween.</li>
    <li>There have been no injuries or fatalities reported related to the comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In January 2025, Comet Lemmon was discovered, quickly gaining media attention for its long and visually striking tail. In September, C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was identified, further captivating observers with its brightness. Comet 3I/Atlas became a topic of debate when an astronomer controversially suggested it could be an alien probe, a claim that has since been refuted by experts.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, discussions surrounding these comets have highlighted both scientific fascination and public curiosity, with many turning to social media to share images and insights.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS are exciting, but there is no reason to claim that they are evidence of alien spacecraft – sometimes a comet is just a comet,” said Robin George Andrews.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The public’s fascination with comets has a long history, with notable instances such as the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1066, which was depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry. While comets have often been interpreted as omens, today's understanding of them is rooted in scientific inquiry rather than superstition.</p>

<p>This year, the context of rising tensions in the US and UK, including political challenges and societal issues, has led some to view the comets as symbols of hope amid uncertainty.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 2025 concludes, researchers will continue to study the data collected from these comets, hoping to uncover more about their compositions and origins. The scientific community looks forward to what new discoveries may arise in 2026.</p>
