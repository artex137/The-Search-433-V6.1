      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Reaches Perihelion Near the Sun</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is currently skimming past the Sun, reaching its perihelion around October 29–30, 2023. Researchers have noted significant activity as the comet enters its most active phase, providing a rare opportunity to study material formed around another star.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Scientists are closely monitoring the comet to gain insights into the chemistry of other planetary systems. Observations from multiple spacecraft are ongoing to track any sudden changes in brightness or fragmentation during this critical period.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> Near perihelion at approximately 1.4 AU from the Sun (about 210 million km).</li>
    <li><strong>Activity:</strong> Visible dust and gas tail, with sunward-pointing jets observed.</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Hydroxyl (OH) detected, indicating water presence along with dust.</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Currently poor; better viewing expected from mid-November.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Agencies:</strong> Multiple spacecraft and solar-system observers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline: The Critical Observing Window</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, key observations will occur:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Now (Oct 29–30):</strong> Expect peak activity; monitors are looking for flares, jet changes, or fragmentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Early November:</strong> The comet will move out from solar glare, allowing for post-perihelion light curves and spectra comparisons.</li>
    <li><strong>Mid–Late November:</strong> Best chance for wider ground-based views; refined estimates of size, rotation, and dust production rates will be made.</li>
    <li><strong>December and beyond:</strong> Activity is expected to wane as the comet recedes; teams will synthesize a full compositional profile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official Statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “As sunlight warms the surface, ices turn to gas, entraining dust into tails and jets that can point in different directions,” a spokesperson for the research team explained. “If the object behaves exactly like volatile-rich comets under peak heating, the natural interpretation only strengthens.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the first interstellar comet to be monitored closely during its perihelion campaign. Previous interstellar visitors, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable information about interstellar bodies, but this is the first time researchers have had the chance to observe a comet through such a critical phase.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the perihelion event, scientists will analyze data to compare 3I/ATLAS with solar-system comets and investigate any anomalies or unusual behaviors. Observations will continue throughout November and December, focusing on the comet's composition and activity patterns.</p>
