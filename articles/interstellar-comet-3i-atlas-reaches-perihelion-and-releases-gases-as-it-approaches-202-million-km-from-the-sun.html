      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion and releases gases as it approaches 202 million km from the Sun</h2>

<p>Astronomers from NASA and the European Space Agency have confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025. The comet approached to within 1.35 astronomical units, or 202 million kilometers, from the Sun. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the closest approach of an interstellar comet to the Sun, providing researchers with a unique opportunity to study its composition and characteristics. The comet poses no risk to Earth, where it will pass at a minimum distance of 270 million kilometers in early December. International monitoring has ruled out any potential impacts due to its hyperbolic trajectory, which indicates that the object will not orbit the Sun again.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun at perihelion:</strong> 1.35 astronomical units (202 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum distance from Earth:</strong> 270 million kilometers in early December</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> More than 100,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated age:</strong> 7 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Observations on July 2 confirmed its presence, noting its fuzzy appearance. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025. Following this perihelion, astronomers have observed an increase in activity, including the release of gases and dust.</p>
<p>From November 2 to 23, ESA's Juice probe will record maximum activity from the comet, with data expected to arrive in February 2026 due to the distance involved.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection reinforces hypotheses about formation in other stellar systems,” said a representative from NASA. “This is a rare chance to learn from an object that has traveled through space for billions of years.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet identified, following Oumuamua and Borisov. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicates it will not return to the Solar System, distinguishing it from other comets that typically orbit the Sun. The study of such comets provides insights into the formation of the Solar System and the conditions of other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observations will focus on collecting spectra and analyzing the comet's composition, with findings expected to enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
