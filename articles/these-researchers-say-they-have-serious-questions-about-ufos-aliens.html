      <h2>Researchers Call for Serious Study of UFOs</h2>
<p>A group of researchers has launched a movement to establish a new academic discipline dedicated to the study of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), also known as UFOs. The initiative, led by the Society for UAP Studies, is concluding an international conference on December 4, 2025, where scholars aim to bring rigorous academic inquiry to the field. The conference features discussions on the empirical aspects of UAPs, which blur the lines between the real and the possible, according to Michael Cifone, the society's co-founder and president.</p>

<p>This initiative matters as it seeks to transform the study of UAPs into a legitimate academic pursuit, moving beyond speculation to a structured analysis of the phenomena. The Society for UAP Studies aims to foster collaboration among researchers from various disciplines, emphasizing scientific objectivity. Cifone has expressed hope that this new focus can lead to a comprehensive understanding of UAPs, which have gained attention from both the public and governmental bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Conference date: December 4, 2025</li>
    <li>Organization: Society for UAP Studies</li>
    <li>Co-founders: Michael Cifone and Michael Silberstein</li>
    <li>Location of conference: not disclosed</li>
    <li>Funding: Private and philanthropic donations, no government backing</li>
    <li>Notable speakers: Steve Fuller, University of Warwick</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2004, U.S. Navy pilots aboard the U.S.S. Nimitz and the U.S.S. Princeton reported encountering "anomalous aerial vehicles" during training exercises. In 2024, Congress held hearings on UAPs, while the Pentagon acknowledged that there are "definitely anomalies," despite finding no definitive evidence of extraterrestrial beings. Additional hearings occurred earlier in 2025, based on hundreds of UAP reports.</p>

<p>As the conference continues, discussions are focused on the need for rigorous methodologies and a framework for studying UAPs scientifically. Cifone emphasized the importance of not taking a definitive stance on the existence of extraterrestrial life, instead prioritizing a scholarly approach to the phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We’re not necessarily taking a position on whether UAPs are evidence of extraterrestrial life... As academics, our skill is in establishing a framework so we're not simply speculating.” 
    — Michael Cifone, co-founder and president of the Society for UAP Studies
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We should prepare for and be open to the possibility” of intelligent life beyond Earth. 
    — Steve Fuller, keynote speaker and professor at the University of Warwick
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The current movement follows a history of interest in UAPs, marked by increasing public and governmental scrutiny. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has noted a "continued geographic collection bias" regarding UAP sightings, primarily near U.S. military assets. The Society for UAP Studies represents a shift towards a more academic lens on these phenomena, aiming to reduce stigma and invite serious inquiry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Society for UAP Studies plans to continue its efforts to establish a recognized academic discipline. Cifone noted that the group is focused on securing institutional support and resources to further their research initiatives in the coming years.</p>
