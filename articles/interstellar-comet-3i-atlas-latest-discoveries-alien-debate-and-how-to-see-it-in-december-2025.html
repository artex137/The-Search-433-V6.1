      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to Make Closest Approach to Earth in December 2025</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, an icy visitor from another star system, will make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 AU (about 270 million km). Discovered on 1 July 2025 by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, the comet has sparked both scientific interest and speculation about potential alien technology.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and are using its trajectory as a live-fire drill for planetary defense planning.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025, at ~1.8 AU (270 million km)</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest to the Sun): ~30 October 2025, at ~1.4 AU (210 million km)</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 250,000 km/h (155,000 mph)</li>
    <li>Diameter: Estimated between ~440 meters and 5.6 km</li>
    <li>Age: Approximately 7 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025, with pre-discovery images dating back to mid-June. It reached perihelion around 30 October 2025, coming close to the orbit of Mars. On 19 November 2025, NASA held a press conference to share comprehensive images and measurements of the comet. Observations indicated the presence of powerful jets and signs of cryovolcanism, which were reported on 1 December 2025.</p>

<p>On 14 November 2025, ESA announced it had improved predictions of the comet's trajectory using images from its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, marking a significant advancement in planetary defense techniques.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks and behaves like a comet, and all available evidence supports a natural origin,” said a NASA official, addressing speculation about alien technology.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The sunward feature may be a swarm of non-evaporating objects,” suggested Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, proposing an alternative explanation for the comet's unusual tail.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS’s discovery adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar objects. The comet's age and composition suggest it has origins in a cold outer region of its home system, potentially providing insights into the early solar system. The comet’s behavior, including its unique jets and periodic brightness variations, has drawn comparisons to both known comets and speculative theories about alien technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. Observations will focus on understanding its composition and any potential implications for planetary defense strategies in the future.</p>
