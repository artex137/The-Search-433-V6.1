      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Closest Pass by Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is making its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2025, remaining about 1.8 astronomical units away, or roughly 270 million km. The event is significant for scientists as it provides a rare opportunity to study material from another star system without posing any threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This flyby is important for astronomical research and allows scientists to observe the comet's characteristics. Various observatories and space missions are participating in this observation, providing valuable data on 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach on December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (270 million km).</li>
    <li>The comet was first reported to the Minor Planet Center on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Initial detection by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Size estimates suggest the nucleus diameter is between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Public livestream scheduled for 11 p.m. EST on December 18, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are coordinating multiple observatories, including Hubble and James Webb telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. Astronomers later identified “pre-discovery” observations dating back to June 14, 2025, refining its trajectory.</p>
<p>The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at about 1.4 AU. Following this, it is expected to be observable from the ground until September 2025, after which it will become more difficult to observe as it nears the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS offers a unique chance to study the comet and gain insights into the materials that form around other star systems,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as an interstellar comet due to its hyperbolic trajectory, which means it is not bound to the Sun. This classification makes it the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system.</p>
<p>This event marks an important moment in astronomy as scientists continue to learn more about the origins and characteristics of comets from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from ground observatories, space telescopes, and interplanetary missions to study the dust and gas emitted by 3I/ATLAS after its closest approach.</p>
