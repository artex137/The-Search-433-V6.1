      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Seen for the First Time Since Disappearance Behind the Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed for the first time since its disappearance behind the sun in early October. Astronomer Dr. Qicheng Zhang at the Lowell Observatory captured images of the comet as it re-emerged into Earth's line of sight on November 4, 2025. The comet is now reportedly brighter than when it went behind the sun.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it allows scientists to study the comet's transformations after its perihelion on October 31, when it passed closest to the sun. Observations suggest that 3I/ATLAS has undergone major changes, including a rapid brightening and a distinct blue hue, indicating the presence of gases in addition to dust.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on October 31, 2025, at a distance of 130 million miles (210 million kilometres) from the sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at speeds over 130,000 miles per hour (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Dr. Zhang used the Discovery Telescope to capture the comet's image.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is now visible with standard amateur telescopes in the northern hemisphere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope on July 1, 2025. It became invisible to Earth-based observers in early October as it approached its closest point to the sun, perihelion, on October 31. The comet re-emerged into view on November 4, 2025, when Dr. Zhang captured its image.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is now rising early enough in morning twilight to be seen even with small telescopes under imperfect conditions,” said Dr. Zhang.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Comets usually produce more gas as they approach the sun and become brighter,” explained Dr. Matthew Genge from Imperial College London. “It’s like turning the kettle on.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“In terms of why we think it is a comet, it is because it looks and acts exactly like a comet,” stated Dr. Mark Norris from the University of Lancashire.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected by scientists, following previous discoveries. The comet's unusually flat and straight trajectory, along with its rapid speed, distinguishes it from typical solar system comets, which remain gravitationally bound to the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away from the sun, astronomers will continue to monitor its changes and study the gases it releases. This research aims to provide insights into the comet's origin and the solar system it came from.</p>
