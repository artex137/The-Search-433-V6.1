      <h2>'Disclosure President' Trump To Release Bombshell 'Non-Blurry' UFO Photos In 2026, Expert Predicts</h2>

<p>Former Air Force nuclear specialist Gene Sticco has predicted that former President Donald Trump will unveil significant UFO evidence, including high-definition images, in 2026. This announcement is part of a broader discussion surrounding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) that has gained momentum following military whistleblowers and Congressional hearings. The predictions come as the topic moves from the fringes of science fiction into serious national security debates.</p>

<p>Sticco's insights stem from years of research on a manuscript allegedly written by his father-in-law, Valerij Černohajev, a former Soviet public works officer. The document reportedly outlines a Soviet-era UFO retrieval program and has influenced Sticco's views on the potential for a Presidential Commission to oversee UAP disclosures. He argues that careful political strategy, rather than sheer transparency, will govern what information is shared with the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Gene Sticco has suggested that 2026 could be pivotal for UAP disclosures.</li>
    <li>Sticco's predictions are based on a 290-page manuscript about a Soviet UFO retrieval program.</li>
    <li>He anticipates the formation of a Presidential Commission to handle UAP disclosures.</li>
    <li>Sticco expects the release of high-definition evidence, including non-blurry photos of UAPs.</li>
    <li>Insiders indicate that substantial evidence remains locked in Pentagon servers.</li>
    <li>The timeline aligns with the first anniversary of the documentary The Age of Disclosure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, the discussion surrounding UAPs has intensified due to testimony from military personnel and Congressional hearings. Notably, in 2023, David Grusch alleged that the U.S. government possesses “non-human biologics” and intact craft, which has further fueled public interest and debate on the subject.</p>

<p>Sticco's research and the translation of the manuscript have led him to co-author a book, Engineering Infinity: Earth's First Interstellar Blueprint, which is linked to his insights on UAPs. He has suggested that a Presidential Commission could soon be formed to address these matters publicly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “That's why I do think President Trump will be the 'disclosure' President,” Sticco told the Daily Star.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It won't be ALL that everyone wants, but it will make it official,” he added regarding the potential commission.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding UAPs has evolved significantly over the past few years. Increased visibility from military whistleblowers and public hearings have shifted the narrative from one of skepticism to serious inquiry. Efforts from political figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who are featured in the documentary The Age of Disclosure, have also called for an end to long-standing secrecy regarding UAPs.</p>

<p>Sticco's predictions suggest a potential shift in how the U.S. government handles UAP-related information, moving towards more transparency while balancing national security concerns.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the conversation around UAPs continues to evolve, the formation of a Presidential Commission may be the next step in addressing public concerns. The timeline for potential disclosures is set for 2026, coinciding with heightened public interest and the anniversary of significant UAP-related media releases.</p>
