      <h2>‘Take A Vacation Before October 29’: Harvard Scientist’s Warning Linked To Mysterious Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A Harvard astrophysicist has warned the public to "take vacations before October 29" as a mysterious interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS approaches the inner solar system. The object, first detected in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, has drawn significant attention due to its size, unusual chemical composition, and trajectory.</p>

<p>This warning has sparked global speculation about the implications of 3I/ATLAS, which is estimated to be about 5.6 kilometers wide and weighs approximately 33 billion tons. NASA has stated that the object poses no threat to Earth and is being closely monitored as it makes its way through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 5.6 kilometers wide</li>
    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> About 33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>First detected:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Emission detected:</strong> Nickel tetracarbonyl, approximately four grams per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified by ATLAS in Chile in July 2025. Subsequent observations revealed its unusual characteristics, including emissions of nickel tetracarbonyl detected by Hawaii's Keck II telescope. As the object approaches the Sun, ongoing studies from international teams are providing insight into its unique chemical properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There’s only one place where nickel tetracarbonyl exists—industrial nickel alloys. This was never observed for any other object,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, the Harvard astrophysicist known for his unconventional theories about extraterrestrial intelligence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. It is simply a rare interstellar visitor that will safely pass through the inner solar system,” stated a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has reignited discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial life and the nature of interstellar objects. While some scientists suggest it may indicate advanced technology, others emphasize caution and advocate for more traditional explanations. Previous interstellar visitors like ‘Oumuamua and Borisov have also prompted similar debates in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to the Sun, scientists from various countries will continue to analyze its composition and behavior. The ongoing research aims to determine whether the object's chemical traits are the result of natural processes or if they suggest something more extraordinary.</p>
