      <h2>Alien-signal hunt finds nothing from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after Green Bank scan</h2>

<p>Researchers from Breakthrough Listen have reported no credible radio signals from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS following a five-hour scan conducted at the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia on December 18, 2025. The findings indicate that the comet, which passed Earth at a distance of approximately 270 million km, has not emitted any technosignatures detectable down to the 100 milliwatt level.</p>

<p>This search is significant as 3I/ATLAS is a rare visitor from outside the solar system, and scientists had a limited opportunity to study its behavior as it approached Earth. NASA has stated that the comet posed no threat to the planet and was first reported to the Minor Planet Center on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. The unusual jet features observed in Hubble images have sparked ongoing interest among researchers, leading to discussions about the comet's behavior and the potential for advanced technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed Earth at a distance of approximately 270 million km.</li>
    <li>The Green Bank Telescope scan lasted about five hours on December 18, 2025.</li>
    <li>No credible radio signals were detected down to the 100 milliwatt level.</li>
    <li>The comet was reported to the Minor Planet Center on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The ATLAS survey in Chile made the initial observation of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first reported to the Minor Planet Center on July 1, 2025. Following this, the comet was observed by the Hubble Space Telescope, revealing unusual jet features that prompted further interest. The Green Bank Telescope conducted its observations on December 18, 2025, focusing on the comet to detect potential technosignatures.</p>

<p>Breakthrough Listen researchers released their findings on January 5, 2026, confirming that no credible radio signals had been detected during the scan.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object is a comet,” said NASA associate administrator Amit Kshatriya in a November briefing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The search for technosignatures from 3I/ATLAS resonates with past investigations into other interstellar objects, such as ʻOumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. These previous events have prompted discussions about the nature of interstellar objects and their potential implications for understanding our universe.</p>

<p>Some experts, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have raised questions about the geometry of the comet's jets, suggesting that they might indicate more than typical comet activity. However, NASA has reiterated that the trajectory and behavior of the object align with a natural body on a hyperbolic orbit.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from the Green Bank Telescope, although the current findings do not rule out the possibility of future discoveries. The NSF–DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to enhance the search for fast-moving objects, potentially leading to more interstellar visitors in the future.</p>
