      <h2>3I ATLAS Update: New Data Reveals Materials From Another Star</h2>

<p>Astronomers studying comet 3I/ATLAS have discovered that it carries material forged around a different star, providing insights into the chemical makeup of planetary systems beyond our own. The comet was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey telescope in Chile.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it offers a rare opportunity to compare how planetary formation may differ across the galaxy. The unique chemical signature of 3I/ATLAS challenges existing models of comet formation and evolution, prompting scientists to rethink the impact of cosmic radiation on such interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on 1 July 2025 in Chile.</li>
    <li>It has a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it will not return to the Solar System.</li>
    <li>Infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope show a high amount of carbon dioxide in its coma.</li>
    <li>The comet will not come closer than approximately 270 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
    <li>Data from 3I/ATLAS will aid future missions, including the Comet Interceptor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Subsequent observations revealed its unusual chemical composition, dominated by carbon dioxide and containing a unique nickel-to-iron ratio. These findings have prompted further investigation into the comet's evolution and its implications for understanding planetary systems.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches its closest point to the Sun, scientists have noted significant changes in its gas composition, suggesting its surface has been altered by cosmic radiation over billions of years.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet carries material forged around another star,” a NASA summary states.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The extraordinary compositions observed challenge existing models of comet formation and evolution,” said a lead researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object recorded, following previous discoveries that have provided insights into the nature of interstellar materials. Previous interstellar objects have also sparked discussions on how they might inform our understanding of planetary formation in different environments.</p>

<p>The unusual composition of 3I/ATLAS may reflect diverse local conditions in its protoplanetary disk, further expanding knowledge on the formation of planetary systems across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the Solar System, astronomers will rely on global observatories and citizen-scientist networks to track and analyze its fading tail. The data collected will be invaluable for future missions and understanding interstellar visitors.</p>
