      <h2>Alien Spacecraft or Cosmic Mystery? Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb Links Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS’s Anomalies to Possible Artificial Origin</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may have an artificial origin due to its strange acceleration and colour changes. The comet, which is approximately the size of Manhattan, has been observed speeding through our solar system and will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This assertion has reignited discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial technology. NASA and the European Space Agency are preparing to closely observe the comet during its upcoming pass, as Loeb urges the scientific community to consider the implications of advanced propulsion systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>The object has shown strange non-gravitational acceleration.</li>
    <li>Loeb has noted a sudden blue hue and brightening of the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet will be closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nasa and the European Space Agency are set to observe the comet closely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual behaviour, including acceleration that does not align with typical cometary activity. This has led Loeb to propose that the comet could be equipped with an internal "engine."</p>

<p>Loeb published his observations in a Medium post, highlighting the comet's unexpected brightening and "bluer than the Sun" appearance. This has prompted further investigation into whether these characteristics are indicative of artificial light or heat emission.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, "The unexpected brightening and bluer than the Sun appearance could be signs of artificial light or heat emission."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects has gained momentum, particularly after the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. This has led to increased interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretations of such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency plan to gather more data during the comet's close approach in December. This will provide an opportunity to determine whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet or a manufactured object.</p>
