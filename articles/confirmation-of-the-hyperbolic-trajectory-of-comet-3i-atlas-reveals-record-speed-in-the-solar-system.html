      <h2>Confirmation of the hyperbolic trajectory of comet 3I/Atlas reveals record speed in the solar system</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed the hyperbolic trajectory of comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object that crosses the Sistema Solar at a speed of <strong>57 kilometers per second</strong>. This speed exceeds that necessary to escape solar attraction, preventing the comet from being captured in an orbit. The discovery marks a significant milestone in understanding the dynamics of objects outside our stellar system.</p>

<p>The detection of 3I/Atlas establishes it as the third confirmed interstellar object, following Oumuamua and Borisov. Its high speed reinforces the hypothesis that it originated from a distant star system, having been ejected for a journey that has lasted millions of years. Continuous observations are crucial for tracking the comet and refining calculations of its trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas travels at 57 km/s, higher than solar system comets.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object, after Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory is hyperbolic, preventing it from entering a stable orbit.</li>
    <li>Gravitational interactions with Sol will slightly alter its path.</li>
    <li>Observatories worldwide are monitoring 3I/Atlas in real time.</li>
    <li>The study of 3I/Atlas could provide insights into the formation of other star systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers first detected comet 3I/Atlas in late 2023. Since then, they have confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory and high velocity. Ongoing observations have focused on determining its closest approach to Sol and refining its path through the Sistema Solar.</p>

<p>The comet's speed has been compared to previous interstellar objects, with notable differences highlighting its external origin. Continuous monitoring by high-capacity telescopes has been essential for tracking its movement and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The gravity of Sol acts like a ‘wave’ that diverts its route, but is insufficient to stop it,” an astronomer stated. “This comet offers a unique opportunity to study the materials from which other stellar systems are formed.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects like 3I/Atlas has become increasingly important in astronomy. Each object provides a glimpse into the dynamics of distant star systems. Previous interstellar objects, such as Oumuamua, have raised questions about their origins and behaviors, prompting further research into their characteristics.</p>

<p>In 2017, Oumuamua exhibited unexpected acceleration as it passed Sol, attributed to the outgassing of trapped hydrogen. This phenomenon continues to be a focal point for understanding how interstellar objects interact with solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas, analyzing its composition and behavior. Ongoing studies aim to refine orbital data and gain deeper insights into the raw materials of distant star systems as the comet completes its passage through the Sistema Solar.</p>
