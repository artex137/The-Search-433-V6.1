      <h2>Documentary: George H.W. Bush Knew of 1964 Alien Contact</h2>

<p>A new documentary claims former U.S. President George H.W. Bush was aware of alien contact in 1964. The film, released on November 23, 2025, discusses alleged encounters and government cover-ups related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs).</p>

<p>This documentary has sparked renewed interest in UFO phenomena and government transparency. Authorities are now facing pressure to declassify documents related to past UFO sightings and contacts, as public interest in the subject continues to grow.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary release date: November 23, 2025</li>
    <li>Subject: alleged alien contact in 1964</li>
    <li>Key figure: George H.W. Bush</li>
    <li>Focus: government cover-ups and UFO phenomena</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1964, several reports surfaced regarding UFO sightings in the United States. The documentary claims that George H.W. Bush, who served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during this time, had knowledge of these incidents.</p>
<p>In the years following, various government agencies have been accused of withholding information about UFOs and potential extraterrestrial encounters. The release of this documentary has prompted discussions about the need for transparency from the government regarding such matters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This documentary sheds light on an important part of our history that has often been overlooked,” said the film’s director. “We hope to encourage a broader conversation about the implications of UFO encounters.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UFOs has gained traction in recent years, particularly following the release of previously classified documents by various governments. This has led to increased public interest and calls for further investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
<p>Prior to this documentary, several high-profile figures have come forward with claims about government knowledge of alien life, further fueling speculation and debate.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In light of the documentary, advocacy groups are calling for the U.S. government to release more information regarding UFO encounters. Investigations into past sightings may be revisited, with potential deadlines for document disclosure yet to be established.</p>
