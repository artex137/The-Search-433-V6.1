      <h2>Watch Out for this Newly Discovered Glowing Comet in October</h2>

<p>A new comet, C/2025 R2 (SWAN) or SWAN25B, has been discovered and may soon be visible to stargazers this fall. Vladimir Bezugly first observed the comet on September 11, 2023, using images from a Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft, according to NASA. The comet is noted for its greenish hue and tail.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it presents a rare opportunity for public observation. NASA has announced two optimal viewing times for the comet: once in early October and again toward the end of the month. Astronomers have indicated that the comet will be easier to see from the southern hemisphere.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Name: C/2025 R2 (SWAN) or SWAN25B</li>
    <li>Date Discovered: September 11, 2023</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: Scheduled for October 20, 2023</li>
    <li>Optimal Viewing Dates: Early October and late October</li>
    <li>Visible Location: Near the western horizon after sunset</li>
    <li>Notable Star: Will pass near Zubenelgenubi, the alpha star of Libra, on October 2</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 11, 2023, Vladimir Bezugly discovered the comet using images from a Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft. NASA confirmed the comet's bright appearance and its greenish hue. The comet is expected to be visible from Earth during specific times in October.</p>

<p>On October 2, 2023, the comet will pass near Zubenelgenubi, offering a good viewing opportunity. The closest approach to Earth will occur on October 20, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet was surprisingly bright but understandably difficult to see against the Sun's glare,” NASA said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s the third time we've ever discovered something coming from outside of the solar system,” said Max Gilbraith, planetarium coordinator at the University of Wyoming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If you ran the odds, the SWAN Comet might be once in a lifetime, but we've seen three of these comets in eight years,” Gilbraith added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The SWAN Comet is part of a series of recent discoveries of objects from outside the solar system. This trend has raised interest among astronomers, as it suggests that Earth may be passing through an interstellar debris field. EarthSky has referred to this comet as a "true once-in-a-lifetime visitor," noting its long orbital period of more than 22,000 years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Stargazers are encouraged to prepare for viewing opportunities in early and late October. Further observations and studies may provide additional insights into the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>
