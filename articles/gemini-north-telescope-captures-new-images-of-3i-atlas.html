      <h2>Gemini North Telescope Captures New Images of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On November 26, 2025, astronomers at the Gemini North telescope in Maunakea, Hawai’i, have captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS). The images show how the comet has changed after its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The new observations are significant as they provide insights into the behavior of 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has organized a public outreach initiative in collaboration with Shadow the Scientists to share these findings with the public. Researchers aim to enhance understanding of the comet's characteristics and the scientific process behind astronomical observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of new images: November 26, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Gemini North telescope, Maunakea, Hawai’i</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Observation tool: Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS)</li>
    <li>Researcher: Bryce Bolin, Eureka Scientific</li>
    <li>Collaboration: NSF NOIRLab and Shadow the Scientists</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. Following this event, the comet reappeared in the sky near the triple-star system Zaniah in the constellation Virgo. On November 26, 2025, astronomers captured new images of the comet using GMOS, revealing changes in its appearance.</p>

<p>In earlier images taken during a Shadow the Scientists session at Gemini South in Chile, the comet displayed a red hue. In contrast, the latest images show a faint greenish glow, attributed to gases evaporating from the comet's coma as it heats up.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Sharing an observing experience in some of the best conditions available gives the public a truly front-row view of our interstellar visitor,” Dr. Bolin said. “Allowing the public to see what we do as astronomers and how we do it also helps demystify the scientific and data collection process, adding transparency to our study of this fascinating object.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as an interstellar comet, providing unique opportunities to study celestial objects that originate from outside the Solar System. Previous observations of comets have shown that their behavior can change significantly due to the Sun's heat, leading to various phenomena such as outbursts or delayed reactions in evaporation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. They aim to understand how the comet behaves as it cools down and what new chemical reactions may occur in its coma.</p>
