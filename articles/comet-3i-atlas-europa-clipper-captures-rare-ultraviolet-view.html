      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Europa Clipper captures rare ultraviolet view</h2>

<p>The Europa Clipper spacecraft has successfully captured unique ultraviolet observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which entered the solar system in July 2025. The observations occurred on November 6, 2025, when the comet was approximately 164 million kilometers from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study the comet during a time when observations from Earth and Mars were largely impractical due to the sun's position. The Southwest Research Institute-led Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) aboard Europa Clipper has enabled scientists to gain insights into the comet’s structure and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was recognized as the third official interstellar object in July 2025.</li>
  <li>Observations were made on November 6, 2025, from a distance of 164 million kilometers.</li>
  <li>The Europa Clipper spacecraft was launched in 2024.</li>
  <li>The UVS instrument is part of a mission scheduled to arrive in the Jovian system in 2030.</li>
  <li>Europa Clipper will perform 49 close flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS became the third officially recognized interstellar object to enter the solar system. Within a week, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) identified its trajectory. Observations from Earth and Mars were limited later in the year due to the sun's position. On November 6, 2025, the Europa Clipper successfully observed the comet, utilizing its unique vantage point to gather data on the comet's two tails.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “We're excited that this opportunity to view another target on the way to Jupiter was completely unexpected,” said Dr. Kurt Retherford, the principal investigator for Europa-UVS at the Southwest Research Institute.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time scientists have studied interstellar comets; however, 3I/ATLAS offers a unique opportunity due to its recent entry into the solar system. The Europa Clipper mission aims to enhance understanding of celestial bodies and their interactions within our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following these observations, researchers will analyze the data collected by the UVS instrument to better understand the composition and behavior of comet 3I/ATLAS before the Europa Clipper continues its mission toward Jupiter.</p>
