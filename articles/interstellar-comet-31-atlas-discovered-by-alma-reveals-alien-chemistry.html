      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Discovered by ALMA Reveals Alien Chemistry</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as 31/ATLAS, has been identified as one of the most chemically unusual visitors to the solar system, according to a study by a team from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. The findings, reported recently, show the comet is approaching its closest pass by Earth, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study the chemical composition of an object from another star system. The research led by NASA astrochemist Martin Cordiner has revealed significant amounts of prebiotic molecules, which could enhance our understanding of the building blocks of alien planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I/ATLAS (31/ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Discovery location: Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), Chile</li>
    <li>Lead researcher: Martin Cordiner, NASA astrochemist</li>
    <li>Composition: Approximately 8% of vapors released is methanol</li>
    <li>Methanol levels: Four times higher than typical comets in the solar system</li>
    <li>Notable molecules: Hydrogen cyanide and methanol</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed as it approaches Earth, providing scientists with valuable data about its composition. The analysis by the ALMA team has highlighted the high levels of methanol and hydrogen cyanide, which are not typically abundant in comets from our solar system.</p>

<p>The findings have been recognized as "among the most enriched values measured in any comet," further emphasizing the uniqueness of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Molecules like hydrogen cyanide and methanol are at trace abundances and not the dominant constituents of our own comets,” Cordiner told New Scientist. “Here we see that, actually, in this alien comet, they’re very abundant.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to a growing body of research on interstellar objects. Prior to this, other interstellar bodies have been observed, but 3I/ATLAS stands out due to its unusual chemical composition, which may provide insights into processes occurring in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its approach, scientists will monitor its trajectory and composition, looking for additional data that could inform our understanding of interstellar objects and their role in the formation of planetary systems.</p>
