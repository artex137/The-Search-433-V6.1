      <h2>Defense expert explains top-secret U.S. UFO investigation</h2>

<p>LAS VEGAS (KLAS) – Dr. James Lacatski has proposed, designed, and managed the largest U.S. government-funded UFO investigation in American history. The program, known as the Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Application Program (AAWSAP), operated in total secrecy in Las Vegas for 27 months and produced the world’s largest UFO database.</p>

<p>The investigation is significant as it aimed to explore UFO/UAP technology and case studies, including incidents at Skinwalker Ranch. Authorities have acknowledged the program's existence, noting that it was funded by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and two Senate colleagues. The program's findings and its eventual termination have sparked renewed interest in government UFO investigations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Program: Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Application Program (AAWSAP)</li>
    <li>Duration: 27 months</li>
    <li>Location: Las Vegas, Nevada</li>
    <li>Funding: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and two U.S. Senate colleagues</li>
    <li>Contractor: Bigelow Aerospace (BAASS)</li>
    <li>Investigators: 50 full-time staff, many ex-military or former law enforcement</li>
    <li>Database: World’s largest UFO database created</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2007, Dr. James Lacatski and his colleague Jay Stratton proposed a clandestine investigation into UFOs. The program was funded and operated in secrecy for 27 months in Las Vegas. It was terminated when funding was pulled due to the investigation expanding beyond initial expectations.</p>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was instrumental in securing funding for the program, which aimed to collect and analyze UFO incidents and technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The investigation went way beyond flying saucers,” said Reid in a 2021 interview with George Knapp.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The AAWSAP program is notable for being the largest government-funded UFO investigation in history. Previous investigations have often been limited in scope or transparency, making AAWSAP a significant development in the study of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>The program's focus on Skinwalker Ranch, known for its reported paranormal activity, highlights the intersection of UFO research and broader investigations into unexplained phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future investigations into UFOs are expected as interest in the topic continues to grow. Authorities may revisit findings from AAWSAP, although specific next steps or timelines have not been disclosed.</p>
