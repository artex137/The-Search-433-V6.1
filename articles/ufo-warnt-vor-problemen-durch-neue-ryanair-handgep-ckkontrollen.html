      <h2>Ryanair's New Hand Luggage Controls Raise Concerns</h2>

<p>Ryanair has announced new hand luggage controls that could lead to additional problems for passengers and crew, according to the flight attendants' union Ufo. The changes are set to take effect in November at various locations, including Germany.</p>

<p>The airline plans to increase bonuses for ground staff who identify oversized or overweight hand luggage. Ufo has expressed concerns that this approach may create tension among already stressed passengers. The union warns that such measures could lead to more incidents of disruptive behaviour on flights.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>New bonus system:</strong> Ryanair will raise bonuses from €1.50 to €2.50 per detected oversized luggage.</li>
    <li><strong>Implementation date:</strong> Changes will take effect in November 2023.</li>
    <li><strong>Size limit:</strong> Passengers are only allowed one free hand luggage piece measuring 40 x 30 x 20 cm.</li>
    <li><strong>Penalty fees:</strong> Passengers found with oversized luggage will face high additional baggage fees.</li>
    <li><strong>Fine for disruptive behaviour:</strong> Ryanair can impose fines of €500 for unruly passengers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent announcements, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary stated that bonuses for ground staff who identify oversized luggage will increase. This decision has prompted Ufo to voice concerns regarding potential negative impacts on the flight experience.</p>
<p>Ufo's leader, Joachim Vazquez Bürger, has stated that the new measures could spoil the atmosphere before flights even begin. He emphasized that the focus should be on maintaining a positive environment for passengers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They spoil the mood even before departure when dealing with already stressed passengers,” said Joachim Vazquez Bürger, head of Ufo.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are determined to eliminate the scourge of oversized luggage that delays boarding and is clearly unfair to the over 99 percent of our passengers who comply with our luggage regulations,” stated a Ryanair spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This move follows Ryanair's ongoing efforts to streamline boarding processes and reduce delays caused by oversized luggage. The airline has faced criticism from consumer protection groups and the European Parliament for its strict luggage policies.</p>
<p>In contrast, Lufthansa has stated that it does not offer bonuses to ground staff related to luggage checks, focusing instead on early identification and resolution of potential issues with passengers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ryanair will implement its new hand luggage policies in November. The airline and Ufo will continue to monitor the impact of these changes on passenger behaviour and overall flight safety.</p>
