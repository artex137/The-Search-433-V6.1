      <h2>Why an interstellar comet has scientists excited</h2>

<p>Scientists have confirmed the presence of nickel vapor in the gas surrounding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which entered our solar system this summer. The comet was first identified on July 1, 2025, and was observed by researchers using various telescopes in Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study an object that originated outside our solar system. Researchers, including Darryl Z. Seligman from Michigan State University and Rohan Rahatgaonkar from the Instituto de Astrofísica-Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, have stated that the findings could offer insights into the chemistry of ancient celestial bodies and their origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first confirmed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nickel vapor was detected at nearly four times Earth's distance from the sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is only the third interstellar object documented to enter our solar system.</li>
    <li>Research teams have used the Very Large Telescope and the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope for observations.</li>
    <li>Findings were reported by a team of scientists, including Puzia and Rahatgaonkar.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers confirmed the existence of 3I/ATLAS during a sky survey conducted by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Following this, researchers began monitoring the comet's trajectory and chemical composition.</p>

<p>As the comet approached the sun, observations were made using the Very Large Telescope in Chile, where researchers detected increasing levels of nickel vapor over several days. This finding was unexpected and prompted further investigation into the comet's origins and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "It was pretty clear that it was nickel. So it was super, super exciting," said Thomas Puzia, who led the team that discovered the nickel vapor.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "This particular interstellar comet could be maybe older than our solar system," said Rohan Rahatgaonkar, highlighting the significance of the comet's ancient origins.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following previous discoveries that have sparked interest in the study of celestial bodies from outside our own solar system. The presence of nickel vapor at such a distance from the sun raises questions about the conditions that allow for such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it moves closer to the sun. They expect thermodynamic changes to occur, which may provide further insights into the comet's formation and evolution.</p>
