      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery: Ice Volcanoes Erupt As a Bizarre ‘Heartbeat’ Emerges</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has intrigued scientists with its unusual characteristics, including a newly discovered 'heartbeat' phenomenon and erupting ice volcanoes. Observations have shown that the comet brightens significantly as it approaches the Sun, with eruptions occurring approximately every 16.16 hours.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may provide insights into the comet's composition and behavior. Scientists are examining the ice jets, which could reveal details about the materials that make up 3I/ATLAS, similar to those found in dwarf planets near Neptune.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits a 'heartbeat' brightness variation.</li>
    <li>Eruptions occur approximately every 16.16 hours.</li>
    <li>Brightness increases by 20 to 40 percent during eruptions.</li>
    <li>Cryovolcanoes, or ice volcanoes, have been observed erupting on the comet's surface.</li>
    <li>The composition of 3I/ATLAS is similar to that of dwarf planets near Neptune.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent studies have revealed the unique features of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Observations have documented the comet's brightness changes and the regularity of its eruptions, drawing comparisons to a heartbeat. The identification of cryovolcanoes marks a significant finding in the study of this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As the comet approached the sun, a series of cryovolcanoes erupted on its surface,” according to LiveScience.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomena surrounding 3I/ATLAS add to the growing body of knowledge regarding comets and their behavior as they near the Sun. Previous studies have indicated that such objects can exhibit a variety of physical changes, and the current findings contribute to our understanding of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its eruptions and composition. Ongoing research may provide further insights into the nature of this comet and its potential implications for our understanding of similar objects in the solar system.</p>
