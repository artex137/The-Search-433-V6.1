      <h2>Strange signal detected from mysterious interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves closer to Earth</h2>

<p>For the first time, astronomers have detected a radio signal from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope picked up absorption lines from OH molecules, consisting of oxygen and hydrogen, around the object on October 24, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it provides insights into the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited unusual behavior unlike typical comets. Experts, including Harvard professor Avi Loeb, are analyzing the data to better understand the object's characteristics and its implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Signal detected on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently about 203 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>OH molecules are moving at approximately 98 kilometers per second relative to Earth.</li>
    <li>Mass loss estimated at 50 billion tons per month.</li>
    <li>Juno spacecraft will probe the object on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 20 and 28, 2025, previous attempts to detect signals from 3I/ATLAS failed. The successful detection on October 24 marked a significant breakthrough. As the object neared the orbital plane of Earth, it became easier to observe. On November 9, optical images revealed that 3I/ATLAS is ejecting massive jets of material.</p>

<p>As of November 10, 2025, ongoing observations continue to provide data on the object's behavior and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is giving us a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object in real time,” said Avi Loeb. “The combination of radio and optical data shows it is shedding massive amounts of material, moving at incredible speeds, and behaving in ways that challenge our understanding of natural comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the second known interstellar object to enter our Solar System, following 1I/'Oumuamua, which was detected in 2017. The unusual properties of 3I/ATLAS have raised questions about its origin and composition, prompting further investigation into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will conduct spectroscopic observations with space telescopes like Hubble and Webb as 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth. These observations may help determine the object's composition, velocity, and mass. The Juno spacecraft will also gather data during its close pass in March 2026.</p>
