      <h2>NASA Denies Alien Claims After Kim Kardashian's 3I/ATLAS Query Sparks Transparency Row</h2>

<p>NASA has denied claims of alien involvement regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS following a tweet from reality TV star Kim Kardashian on October 4, 2023. The agency's swift response to Kardashian's inquiry has led to criticism from lawmakers and researchers who allege that NASA is withholding data related to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's recent flyby.</p>

<p>This controversy raises concerns about NASA's transparency and responsiveness to scientific inquiries. Critics point out the disparity in the agency's quick engagement with a celebrity compared to its slower response to formal requests from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2023</li>
    <li>NASA's Acting Administrator Sean Duffy responded to Kardashian's tweet on October 4, 2023</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following &#699;Oumuamua and Borisov</li>
    <li>HiRISE camera images from Mars flyby on October 2-3 remain unpublished</li>
    <li>US government shutdown began on October 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Representative Anna Paulina Luna has called for immediate release of the data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 4, 2023, Kim Kardashian tweeted about 3I/ATLAS, prompting a quick response from NASA's Acting Administrator Sean Duffy. He stated that the interstellar object poses no threat to Earth and confirmed it is not of alien origin. This interaction drew widespread attention and sparked discussions about NASA's communication practices.</p>

<p>On October 2-3, 2023, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter conducted a flyby of 3I/ATLAS, capturing images that have yet to be released. The delay in publishing these images has been linked to the US government shutdown.</p>

<p>Lawmakers, including Representative Anna Paulina Luna, have since urged NASA to release the data, emphasizing its importance for understanding interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said NASA's Acting Administrator Sean Duffy in response to Kardashian's tweet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Science should not be held hostage to politics,” stated Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, criticizing NASA for prioritizing celebrity inquiries over scientific requests.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The incident has reignited debates about NASA's accountability in releasing publicly funded data. Critics argue that the agency should prioritize transparency and responsiveness to the scientific community, particularly when public interest is piqued by celebrity engagement.</p>

<p>This event follows previous concerns regarding NASA's communication strategies and the impact of social media on scientific discourse.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has stated that further data releases regarding 3I/ATLAS are forthcoming, pending internal review processes. However, no specific timeline has been provided for when the HiRISE images will be made public. The agency faces ongoing pressure from lawmakers and researchers to enhance transparency in its operations.</p>
