      <h2>Is Trump Preparing a UFO Disclosure Speech? Lara Trump Weighs In</h2>

<p>Rumors about a potential UFO speech by former President Donald Trump have emerged, with Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, addressing this speculation during her show, “The Right View.” She indicated that discussions suggest he might have a speech prepared concerning extraterrestrial life, although there is no confirmed evidence of such a speech being planned.</p>

<p>The speculation around Trump's possible UFO address has intensified, particularly following comments from British writer and ufologist Mark Christopher Lee. Authorities and media outlets, including Newsweek, have investigated these claims but have not verified them. The lack of concrete evidence raises questions about the validity of the rumors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>Lara Trump discussed the rumors on her show, “The Right View.”</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early February 2026, rumors began circulating about a potential speech by Donald Trump regarding UFOs. Lara Trump commented on these discussions during her show, “The Right View.” Mark Christopher Lee, a ufologist, contributed to the speculation, claiming a significant disclosure could be forthcoming but provided no verifiable proof.</p>

<p>On February 20, 2026, Newsweek reported its findings, indicating that it could not confirm the rumors. The report highlighted that Trump had previously expressed skepticism about UFOs, further complicating the narrative surrounding the current speculation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There are discussions suggesting that he might have a speech prepared about extraterrestrial life,” Lara Trump said on “The Right View.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Mark Christopher Lee stated via email that a reliable Washington insider has reportedly said that President Trump has prepared a historic speech about extraterrestrial visitation and recovered non-human materials.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The rumors regarding Trump's potential UFO speech have gained traction amid ongoing public interest in extraterrestrial life and government disclosure. The 1947 Roswell incident remains a focal point in UFO discussions, with Lee suggesting that the speech might include references to historical incidents and future steps toward declassification.</p>

<p>Trump's past comments on UFOs, including his skepticism in 2024, add a layer of complexity to the current rumors. The administration has not issued any official statements regarding a planned speech.</p>
