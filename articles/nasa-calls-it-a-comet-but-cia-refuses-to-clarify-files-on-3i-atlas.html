      <h2>NASA Calls It a Comet, But CIA Refuses to Clarify Files on 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A rare response from the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has sparked renewed debate over the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which NASA has classified as a comet. The CIA's refusal to clarify whether it has investigated the object has raised questions globally. 3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2025 and is currently moving through the solar system.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it touches on the intersection of space science and national security. While NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, the CIA's ambiguous response has led some scientists and researchers to speculate about the object's true nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA has identified it as a natural comet.</li>
    <li>The CIA has issued a 'Glomar response' regarding information on 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>NASA officials confirmed the object poses no threat at a press conference on November 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>FOIA request filed by John Greenewald Jr. seeking CIA information on 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to approach Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS, identifying it as an interstellar object. NASA announced that the object is a natural comet and poses no threat. On November 19, 2025, NASA officials reiterated their findings during a press conference. Shortly thereafter, John Greenewald Jr. submitted a FOIA request to the CIA regarding the object. The CIA responded with a 'Glomar response', indicating it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of relevant records.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter on March 16, 2026, discussions surrounding its nature and the CIA's response continue to gain traction.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>NASA Administrator Nicky Fox stated, "We have found nothing that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb expressed concern, stating, "It is surprising that the CIA would treat information about the object as sensitive when NASA had already declared it harmless."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CIA's response has occurred amid a broader public interest in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and government transparency. Just days after the FOIA request was filed, a documentary titled “The Age of Disclosure” was released, featuring interviews with government officials discussing alleged UFO cover-ups. Despite various claims over the decades, the US military and federal government maintain there is no physical evidence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Greenewald Jr. has indicated plans to appeal the CIA’s response in hopes of obtaining clearer answers. He has also filed similar FOIA requests with NASA and other US agencies, with responses pending. The status of 3I/ATLAS remains officially classified as a natural comet, but the CIA's lack of clarity continues to fuel speculation and interest.</p>
