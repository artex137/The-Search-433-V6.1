      <h2>Reports of UFOs sightings on the rise in Belgium - with spike reported in March</h2>

<p>Belgium’s UFO hotline has recorded a total of 237 sightings of unidentified flying objects in 2025, according to an annual report released on January 5, 2026. This marks a 44% increase from the previous year, following a significant decline in reports from 2023 to 2024. The spike in March has been attributed to a fuel release from SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket during a satellite launch.</p>

<p>The Belgische UFO-meldpunt (Belgian UFO Reporting Centre) has been monitoring aerial phenomena since 2007. Their findings highlight a concerning trend in public interest and confusion regarding aerial sightings. Authorities have noted that many reports stem from misidentifications of common objects, including aircraft and astronomical bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>237 UFO sightings recorded in 2025.</li>
    <li>44% increase compared to 165 sightings in 2024.</li>
    <li>Majority of sightings occurred in March and September.</li>
    <li>March spike linked to SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket fuel release.</li>
    <li>In November, only 11 sightings were connected to drones near military bases.</li>
    <li>Misidentifications often involved aircraft, helicopters, or stars.</li>
    <li>Belgian Committee for the Study of Space Phenomena (Cobeps) will release its report soon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2025, Belgium’s UFO Reporting Centre documented a notable increase in UFO sightings. The year began with a significant rise in reports, particularly in March, which coincided with the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch. Following this, the centre noted a decline in reports towards the end of the year, with a mere 11 sightings attributed to drones in November.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, the centre has conducted analyses and provided explanations for many sightings, often attributing them to common aerial phenomena such as aircraft or astronomical events.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The rise in reports reflects a growing public interest in aerial phenomena, but most sightings can be attributed to misidentifications,” said a representative from the Belgische UFO-meldpunt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Patrick Ferryn, president of Cobeps, indicated, “We are preparing our report and expect to provide additional insights into the sightings recorded this year.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Belgium has seen fluctuating numbers of UFO sightings over the years, with a peak of 227 reports in 2023 before the drop in 2024. The ongoing analysis by both the Belgian UFO Reporting Centre and Cobeps aims to clarify the nature of these sightings and address public concerns regarding aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been an increase in public engagement with UFO phenomena, partly fueled by the rise of social media and online platforms where individuals can share their experiences and findings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Belgian Committee for the Study of Space Phenomena is expected to release its report soon, which may provide further context and analysis of the 2025 sightings. The Belgian UFO Reporting Centre will continue to investigate and analyze reports as they come in.</p>
