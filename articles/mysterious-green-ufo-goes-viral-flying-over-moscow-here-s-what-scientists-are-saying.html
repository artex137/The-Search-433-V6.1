      <h2>Mysterious green ‘UFO’ goes viral flying over Moscow</h2>

<p>A glowing green fireball has captivated hundreds of people in Moscow after it lit up the night sky on October 27. Video footage shows the vivid orb streaking across Russia’s capital at high speeds before bursting into flames and vanishing behind clouds. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The sighting has sparked renewed speculation about UFOs and extraterrestrial life online. However, Russian scientists have suggested a more mundane explanation for the phenomenon. Authorities are monitoring the situation as public interest in unidentified flying objects continues to grow.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: October 27, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Moscow, Russia</li>
    <li>Object: Green fireball</li>
    <li>Expert opinion: Likely space debris, according to Alexander Rodin</li>
    <li>No injuries reported</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 27, 2023, a bright green object was observed flying over Moscow, with videos circulating widely on social media platforms such as Telegram and X. The object appeared to travel quickly before igniting and disappearing from sight.</p>
<p>Experts, including Alexander Rodin from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, have analyzed the footage and concluded that the object is probably artificial space debris, not a UFO.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Judging by the video, the relatively slow speed and its significant slowdown at the end of the visible portion of the flight, as well as the green and yellow shades, rather point to its artificial origin,” said Alexander Rodin, head of UAV-related Project Activities.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting coincides with heightened interest in unidentified aerial phenomena, particularly following discussions about 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object that has sparked debate over its potential origins. While NASA categorizes it as a comet, some experts, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have speculated it could be artificial. Loeb has called for global leaders to consider protocols for responding to potential alien technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to assess public interest and scientific explanations regarding the sighting. Further analysis of the object may provide more clarity on its origins and nature.</p>
