      <h2>3I/ATLAS: One Last Peek At The Interstellar Exocomet Before Exit By The Virtual Telescope Live Streamed</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, first spotted by the ATLAS observatory in Chile on July 1, 2025, is set to be viewed one last time before it exits the solar system. The live event will take place on January 17, 2026, at 2:30 AM IST, as the comet travels towards the Jovian moon Eupheme.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object identified after 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet has intrigued scientists due to its unusual characteristics, including a peculiar anti-tail phenomenon. Various global space agencies, including NASA and ESA, are monitoring the comet, but the opportunity for Earth-based observations is diminishing.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Live stream date:</strong> January 17, 2026, at 2:30 AM IST</li>
    <li><strong>Current trajectory:</strong> Towards Jovian moon Eupheme</li>
    <li><strong>Observatories involved:</strong> ATLAS, NASA, ESA, The Virtual Telescope Project</li>
    <li><strong>Number of anomalies reported:</strong> 17</li>
    <li><strong>Scanning duration by SETI:</strong> 5 hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was identified by the ATLAS observatory in Chile on July 1, 2025. Since then, it has drawn attention for its anomalous traits, which have been reported by astrophysicist Prof. Avi Loeb. In recent months, the comet has been under continuous observation by various international space agencies.</p>
<p>The Virtual Telescope Project has announced a live streaming event to provide one last look at 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its exit from the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The peculiar anti-tail that is sunward and not receding even after the perihelion has baffled experts,” said Prof. Avi Loeb, highlighting the comet's unusual characteristics.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“SETI's five-hour scan did not detect any alien radio signals, but the methodology may have been too brief to yield results,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its discovery has reignited interest in the study of interstellar objects and their implications for understanding the universe. The comet has been under scrutiny for its unique features, which have prompted further investigation from various astronomical organizations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The live stream on January 17 will be the final opportunity for Earth-based observation of 3I/ATLAS before it leaves the solar system. Following the event, ongoing studies will likely continue to analyze data collected during its passage through the solar system.</p>
