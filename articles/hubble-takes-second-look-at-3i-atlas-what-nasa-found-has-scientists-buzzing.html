      <h2>Hubble takes second look at 3I/ATLAS — what NASA found has scientists buzzing</h2>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS again, capturing new images as the comet approaches Earth in December. Hubble's latest observations occurred on November 30, when 3I/ATLAS was approximately 178 million miles from Earth.</p>

<p>This observation is significant because it allows scientists to study the comet's characteristics and trajectory as it travels through the solar system. NASA has emphasized that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and has encouraged the public to observe the comet with small telescopes until spring 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
<li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 178 million miles on November 30</li>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> About 137,000 miles per hour</li>
<li><strong>Next Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, projected to be 170 million miles away</li>
<li><strong>Initial Discovery:</strong> July 2025</li>
<li><strong>Size Estimates:</strong> Between 1,400 feet and 3.5 miles wide</li>
<li><strong>Notable Observations:</strong> Hubble and ESA's JUICE spacecraft</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by Hubble in July 2025, shortly after entering the solar system. The comet was confirmed as the third interstellar object observed by astronomers. On October 30, it made its closest approach to the Sun before Hubble's recent observation on November 30. ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) also tracked the comet from November 2 to November 25, noting its active state.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said Sean Duffy, Acting Administrator of NASA, addressing rumors about the comet's origin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, stated, “We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest due to its interstellar origin and unusual trajectory. Unlike typical comets that orbit the Sun, 3I/ATLAS has a hyperbolic orbit, which means it will eventually exit the solar system. The comet's unusual characteristics have sparked various theories about its nature, including speculation about extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth. Observations from both Hubble and JUICE will provide further data, with complete analysis from JUICE expected in February 2026.</p>
