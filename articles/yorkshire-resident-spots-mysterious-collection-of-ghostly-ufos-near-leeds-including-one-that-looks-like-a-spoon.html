      <h2>Yorkshire resident spots mysterious collection of ghostly UFOs near Leeds</h2>

<p>A Yorkshire resident has reported seeing a collection of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in Headingley, Leeds, over several months, with the sightings occurring around midnight. Photographer Jesse Gallagher captured the images using his iPhone between August 2021 and November 2023. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to these sightings.</p>

<p>The sightings have sparked interest among UFO enthusiasts and researchers. Local authorities have not officially commented on the incidents. The photographs, shared exclusively with the Daily Mail, depict various strange shapes and sizes, including one that resembles a spoon. UFO researcher Philip Mantle has suggested that the images could show distant light sources that appear different due to being out of focus.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Photographs taken by Jesse Gallagher between August 2021 and November 2023.</li>
    <li>Sightings occurred around midnight in Headingley, Leeds, West Yorkshire.</li>
    <li>One object reportedly resembles a spoon or spade.</li>
    <li>Philip Mantle has commented on the images, suggesting they may show out-of-focus light sources.</li>
    <li>Another recent sighting in Yorkshire involved a saucer-shaped object near Skipton.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2021, Jesse Gallagher began capturing images of unidentified flying objects in Headingley. He continued to document these sightings until November 2023. The photographs were taken after dark, which made the unusual lights easier to detect.</p>

<p>In late September 2025, Gallagher shared his findings with the Daily Mail, prompting discussions among UFO researchers. The photos include various shapes, including a bright white orb and a textured grey object that may resemble discarded machinery.</p>

<p>On September 21, 2025, another Yorkshire resident, John Tunnah, reported seeing a saucer-shaped object near Skipton, capturing it in one of several photographs taken from the hills.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “When zooming in, the orbs are either white or multi-coloured and can be seen pulsating,” Jesse Gallagher told the Daily Mail.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The out of focus image makes the light look very different from what the naked eye would see,” said Philip Mantle, a British UFO researcher.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I suspect either a glitch with the camera, or a fast-moving object like a bird or an insect, close to the lens,” stated Nick Pope, a UFO expert formerly with the UK's Ministry of Defence.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have gained prominence since World War II, with many linking them to the possibility of extraterrestrial life. However, the term "UFO" has fallen out of favour with some authorities, including the Pentagon, which now uses the term "unidentified aerial phenomenon" (UAP) to avoid associations with conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Recent sightings in other locations, such as Los Angeles, have reignited discussions about unidentified crafts, with various explanations provided by researchers and witnesses.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Local authorities have not announced any investigations into the recent sightings. UFO enthusiasts and researchers are expected to continue analyzing the photographs and discussing their implications.</p>
