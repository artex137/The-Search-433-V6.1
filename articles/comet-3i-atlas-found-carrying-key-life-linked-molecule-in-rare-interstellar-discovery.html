      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Found Carrying Key Life-Linked Molecule in Rare Interstellar Discovery</h2>

<p>A team of scientists has discovered high levels of methanol in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, marking the first observation of this molecule in an extraterrestrial object. The findings were reported on October 20, 2023, following extensive analysis using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because methanol is closely linked to the origins of life. The research team, led by Martin Cordiner of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, has revealed that 3I/ATLAS differs markedly from comets in our Solar System, providing insights into the composition of distant star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery reported on October 20, 2023</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor</li>
    <li>Hydrogen cyanide is emitted at a rate of 250–500 grams per second</li>
    <li>Methanol is produced at a remarkable 40 kilograms per second</li>
    <li>Methanol constitutes nearly 8% of the comet’s total vapour output</li>
    <li>Research team led by Martin Cordiner from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center</li>
    <li>Study conducted using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent studies, researchers have focused on comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar visitor, which has shown unique characteristics compared to Solar System comets. The team led by Cordiner utilized ALMA to analyze the comet's emissions, leading to the discovery of high levels of methanol and hydrogen cyanide.</p>
<p>Findings indicate that the comet has a diverse composition and is producing these molecules at rates significantly higher than those typically found in Solar System comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Hydrogen cyanide and methanol typically exist only in small traces in Solar System comets. But in this interstellar object, they appear unusually abundant,” said Martin Cordiner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s very unlikely you can reach significant molecular complexity without forming methanol along the way,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery builds on past research by Josep Trigo-Rodríguez of the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, which predicted that metal-rich comets would produce large amounts of methanol. The new findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS may be rich in metals, providing further clues about its ancient interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research teams will continue to analyze comet 3I/ATLAS to understand its composition and the implications for the origins of life in the universe. Further studies may shed light on the conditions present in distant star systems.</p>
