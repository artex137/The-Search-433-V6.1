      <h2>Strange lights in Night Sky? It was SpaceX Starlink, not UFOs</h2>

<p>Residents in several areas of Texas reported seeing strange lights in the night sky on January 19, 2026. The lights were later confirmed to be part of a SpaceX Starlink satellite deployment. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>
