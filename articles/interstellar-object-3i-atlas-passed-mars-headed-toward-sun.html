      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Passed Mars, Headed Toward Sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to Mars at 4:00 UTC on October 3, 2025, approximately 18 million miles (29 million kilometers) from the planet. This marks the object’s nearest approach to any planet during its journey through the solar system.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the scientific insights it may provide regarding the origins of interstellar objects. NASA has launched a new page dedicated to tracking 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to reach perihelion, its closest point to the sun, on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: 4:00 UTC, October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars at closest approach: 18 million miles (29 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion distance: approximately 1.36 astronomical units from the sun</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of nucleus: between 1,050 feet (320 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers)</li>
    <li>Origin direction: Sagittarius, from the center of the Milky Way galaxy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025. Initial estimates suggested its nucleus was about 12 miles (20 km) in diameter. By late July, the estimate had decreased to 6 miles (10 km), and subsequent analysis using Hubble data reduced it further to between 1,050 feet (320 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 km).</p>

<p>On August 7, 2025, NASA provided an updated size estimate, indicating the object could be even smaller than previously thought. As it approaches perihelion, between November 2 and 25, ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will observe 3I/ATLAS, likely capturing data on its active state.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Identifying the origin of interstellar objects is key to understanding planet formation efficiency, the distribution of volatiles and organics in the galaxy, and the dynamical pathways by which planetary systems evolve,” said Xabier Pérez-Couto, lead researcher from the University of A Coruña in Spain.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous studies have suggested that these objects can provide valuable information about the early formation of solar systems and the evolution of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun. Data from JUICE's observations is expected to be available in February 2026, which may enhance understanding of the object's characteristics and origins.</p>
