      <h2>New Images Reveal 3I/ATLAS Anti-Tail Longer Than Earth-Moon Distance</h2>

<p>New observations of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS have revealed an anti-tail extending over 500,000 kilometers, surpassing the average distance between Earth and the Moon. The discovery was made on December 14–15, 2025, as the object approached a perigee of 268.9 million kilometers on December 19, 2025. This unprecedented finding was captured by telescopes in Italy, California, and Thailand.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it represents the largest anti-tail ever observed for any comet or interstellar object, according to experts. Ongoing observations will continue to track the anti-tail’s evolution as 3I/ATLAS moves away from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of discovery: December 14–15, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Perigee on: December 19, 2025, at 268.9 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Length of anti-tail: over 500,000 kilometers</li>
    <li>Locations of observations: Calabria (Italy), June Lake (California), Rayong (Thailand)</li>
    <li>Key observers: Toni Scarmato, Dan Bartlett, Teerasak Thaluang</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 13, 2025, a 0.26-meter telescope in Rayong, Thailand, confirmed the anti-tail feature using rotational-gradient brightness mapping techniques. The following day, a 14-inch telescope in June Lake, California, produced an integrated image that revealed a green-blue anti-tail spanning 4.24 million kilometers. On December 15, a 0.25-meter telescope in Calabria, Italy, captured a notable image highlighting the anti-tail's sunward extension.</p>
<p>The anti-tail was first recorded in a Hubble Space Telescope image on July 21, 2025, at a distance of 2.98 AU from Earth and remained visible in subsequent images, confirming its persistent nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This distance exceeds the average lunar distance of 384,400 kilometers and represents the largest anti-tail observed for any comet or interstellar object to date,” experts say.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Anti-tails typically appear temporarily in solar system comets when Earth crosses the comet’s orbital plane. However, the anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS has shown persistence, indicating a more complex interaction with solar radiation and the solar wind.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ground-based and space-based observatories will continue to track 3I/ATLAS, with further observations expected near perigee on December 19, 2025. These studies aim to enhance understanding of interstellar objects and the processes that contribute to the formation of anti-tails.</p>
