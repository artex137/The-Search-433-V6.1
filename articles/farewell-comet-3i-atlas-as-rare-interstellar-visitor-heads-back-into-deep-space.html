      <h2>Farewell, Comet 3I/ATLAS As Rare Interstellar Visitor Heads Back Into Deep Space</h2>

<p>On December 19, 2023, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, passing within approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) of the planet. This event marked a significant moment for scientists, who had a brief opportunity to study material from beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>The close encounter with 3I/ATLAS is important because it represents a rare chance to gather data from an object that originated from outside our solar system. Scientists are now analyzing the information collected during its flyby, which could provide insights into the formation of planetary systems around other stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The closest distance was about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet was first observed on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Scientists estimate the comet could be as old as 7 billion years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Its trajectory indicated it did not originate from within the solar system.</p>
<p>As the comet approached the sun in late October, it exhibited an unexpected brightening, outpacing typical comets at similar distances. Observations were made using instruments from STEREO, SOHO, and GOES-19.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2023, the comet made its closest approach to Earth before beginning its departure into deep space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet could be extraordinarily ancient. While comets from our solar system are at most about 4.5 billion years old, 3I/ATLAS might be as old as 7 billion years,” said Matthew Hopkins, an astronomer at the University of Oxford.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar object confirmed to pass through our solar system, following 1I/?Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike typical comets that form alongside planets around our sun, interstellar comets originate from other stars and are ejected into space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>While 3I/ATLAS is now leaving the solar system, scientists will continue to study the data collected during its visit for years to come. This research aims to enhance understanding of how material moves between stars and the formation of planetary systems.</p>
