      <h2>Drone in Romania</h2>
<p>On September 14, Romania summoned Russian Ambassador Vladimir Lipaev after a Russian drone entered Romanian airspace a day earlier, prompting a formal protest from Bucharest. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The incident is significant as it raises concerns over Romania's airspace security and regional stability. The Romanian Foreign Ministry has expressed strong objections to what it deems a violation of national sovereignty and is in ongoing discussions with allies and EU partners regarding the situation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: September 13</li>
    <li>Location: Romanian airspace</li>
    <li>Russian Ambassador: Vladimir Lipaev</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 13, the Romanian Ministry of Defense detected a drone in its airspace, which it identified as a Russian drone. Romanian fighter jets were deployed to intercept the drone, but it eventually disappeared from radar.</p>
<p>The following day, on September 14, Romania summoned the Russian ambassador to lodge a formal protest. The Russian embassy countered by claiming that Romania had not provided convincing evidence regarding the drone's origin.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Russian ambassador suggested that the incident might be part of a "deliberate provocation" orchestrated by Ukraine.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The Romanian side has expressed its strong protest against this unacceptable and irresponsible act, which constitutes a violation of Romania's sovereignty,” the Romanian Foreign Ministry stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    The Russian embassy described the protest as “far-fetched and unfounded,” asserting that Romania did not provide sufficient evidence to confirm the drone's origin.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>Earlier, on the same day as the drone incident, Poland responded to the drone threat by raising its aviation alert and closing the Lublin airport, indicating a broader regional concern regarding airspace security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
