      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS surprises scientists with non-gravitational acceleration detected by ALMA</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected unexpected non-gravitational acceleration in comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object identified in the Solar System, during observations made by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) on October 29, 2025. The anomaly was confirmed in the following weeks as the comet approached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it highlights the comet's unusual behavior, which deviates from typical gravitational influences. Authorities, including NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), are analyzing the data to understand the underlying processes that contribute to this acceleration and its implications for studying interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed on October 29, 2025.</li>
  <li>The comet is traveling at a speed of 57 km/s on a hyperbolic trajectory.</li>
  <li>A deviation of four arcseconds in the comet's right ascension has been noted.</li>
  <li>This deviation is equivalent to ten times the radius of Earth in one month.</li>
  <li>NASA has released unprecedented images of the comet as it approached Earth.</li>
  <li>The comet's core has lost at least one-sixth of its total mass due to sublimation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, ALMA captured detailed observations of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing an unexpected deviation in its orbit. Data processing and validation occurred in the following weeks, confirming the comet's non-gravitational acceleration during its approach to perihelion. As the comet neared the Sun, increased solar radiation prompted significant sublimation from its nucleus, leading to the observed changes in trajectory.</p>

<p>NASA's JPL conducted an analysis of the data, highlighting the unique characteristics of this interstellar comet and its natural propulsion system, caused by gas jets forming as ice sublimates. The analysis is ongoing, with additional observations expected to refine the comet's orbital model.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unexpected acceleration of comet 3I/ATLAS is a remarkable phenomenon that sheds light on the dynamics of interstellar objects,” said a NASA engineer involved in the study. “This comet serves as a unique opportunity to understand planetary formation outside our solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its active sublimation mechanisms, which are intensified as it approaches the Sun. Such behavior has been observed in other comets but is particularly significant in an interstellar context. The comet's high level of activity offers valuable insights into the conditions of its home system and the processes that govern the behavior of comets from other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue in the coming weeks and months, with specialized telescopes monitoring its trajectory and behavior. Researchers aim to gather more data to refine the comet's orbital model and better understand its composition and activity.</p>
