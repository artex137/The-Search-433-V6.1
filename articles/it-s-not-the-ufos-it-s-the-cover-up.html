      <h2>It’s not the UFOs — it’s the cover-up</h2>

<p>The ongoing governmental cover-up of UFO sightings continues to raise concerns, as whistleblowers report job losses after sharing their experiences, according to a recent congressional hearing. The hearing, held in September 2025, revealed alarming practices by government agencies aimed at intimidating and silencing witnesses of unidentified flying objects.</p>

<p>This matter has significant implications for public trust and government accountability. Authorities are facing scrutiny over claims that they have destroyed documents subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and transferred relevant information to private companies, effectively evading public oversight. Critics argue that these actions threaten national security and undermine citizens' rights to information.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 2025, a congressional hearing on UFOs took place, allowing witnesses to present their experiences. During the hearing, it was revealed that whistleblowers have faced job losses for reporting sightings. Additionally, the hearing highlighted the destruction of FOIA documents and the transfer of information to private aerospace companies.</p>

<p>A video clip presented at the hearing depicted a UFO resembling a tic-tac being struck by a hellfire missile. The object reportedly did not respond to identification signals and posed a potential threat in a combat zone. The missile appeared to bounce off the UFO without causing significant disturbance.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The extreme measures taken by unaccountable government agencies to silence witnesses are alarming,” said a congressional representative during the hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When the government hides information, it undermines public trust and respect for the agencies responsible for national security,” another witness stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing follows a pattern of secrecy surrounding UFO sightings and related government actions. Previous incidents have raised questions about the government's handling of information and its implications for national security. The lack of transparency has led to widespread suspicions of a cover-up among the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the actions of government agencies are expected to continue, with calls for greater transparency and accountability. The Department of Justice has not yet announced any specific inquiries related to the allegations presented during the hearing.</p>
