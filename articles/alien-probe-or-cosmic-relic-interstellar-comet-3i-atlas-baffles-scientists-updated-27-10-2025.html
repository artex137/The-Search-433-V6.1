      <h2>Alien Probe or Cosmic Relic? Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Baffles Scientists</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), the third known interstellar object, has been detected racing through our Solar System at approximately 58 km/s (130,000 mph) since its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. It is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun, or perihelion, on October 29, 2025, at around 1.4 AU, which is inside Mars' orbit. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study an object from beyond our Solar System. Authorities, including NASA and ESA, are actively monitoring 3I/ATLAS. They confirm that the comet poses no threat to Earth, as its trajectory keeps it at least 1.8 AU (approximately 270 million km) away from our planet. Astronomers worldwide are using this event as a planetary defense drill to practice orbit predictions for potentially hazardous asteroids.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It travels at approximately 58 km/s (130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>Perihelion is expected on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach will be approximately 1.8 AU (270 million km).</li>
    <li>Estimated size is between 5 to 11 km across.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA confirm the comet poses no danger to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey in Chile detected Comet 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third interstellar visitor. By August, telescopes observed a rare sunward jet, which later flipped into a normal tail by September as the comet approached the Sun. The comet has exhibited unusual activity, shedding approximately 40 kg of water per second even at a distance of 2.9 AU from the Sun. It will reach perihelion on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet. There’s no reason to think it’s something else,” said Dr. Michael Küppers, an ESA comet expert.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Finding familiar molecules like water in 3I/ATLAS is like reading a note from another planetary system,” stated Dr. Dennis Bodewits of Auburn University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discoveries of two previous interstellar objects: ʻOumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Its unusual characteristics have sparked speculation about its origins, particularly its chemical composition, which includes a high carbon dioxide-to-water vapor ratio and the presence of nickel gas.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, astronomers are racing to gather data before it becomes less visible. Several spacecraft, including ESA’s JUICE probe and NASA’s Europa Clipper, will encounter the comet's tail in November, providing additional opportunities for observation and study.</p>
