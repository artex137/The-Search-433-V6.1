      <p class="byline">Published 2026-02-05 15:52 UTC</p>

      <h2>Krasnikov (Russia): Comet 3I/ATLAS is not from the solar system, but it is not an alien spacecraft</h2>

<p>The head of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Gennady Krasnikov, has addressed speculation surrounding comet 3I/ATLAS, stating it is not an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Krasnikov made his remarks during a press conference in Krasnikov, Russia, on December 19, 2023, following the comet's closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>This clarification comes amid widespread public interest and speculation about the comet's unusual characteristics. Authorities, including NASA, have monitored the comet's trajectory, assuring the public that it poses no threat as it moves away from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA captured images of the comet on July 21, 2025, from 450 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to leave the solar system in early 2026.</li>
    <li>Gennady Krasnikov explained the comet's unusual behavior due to its interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>Russian President Vladimir Putin commented on the comet during a live broadcast.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS at a distance of 450 million kilometers from Earth. The comet became visible from Earth in early November 2025. It passed its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023. Following the close approach, Krasnikov clarified its origins and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “There has been a lot of noise and bold claims regarding comet 3I/ATLAS. Comets in our solar system have clearly defined orbits because they have been orbiting the Sun for a considerable time, and their surfaces have been 'smoothed' by the solar wind. But comet 3I/ATLAS did not come from our solar system and was thus not strongly affected by our Sun,” stated Gennady Krasnikov.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "But returning to the scientific view, everything has been calculated for a long time—the trajectory, the degree of danger posed by the comet—and it is clear that it is now moving further away, toward Jupiter, and is leaving our solar system," Krasnikov concluded.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It is a comet, and Russian scientists are aware of its status,” said President Putin during a live broadcast, responding to speculation about the comet being a secret weapon.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to Krasnikov's statements, several foreign sources had speculated that comet 3I/ATLAS could be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Russian cosmonaut Sergei Kud-Sverchkov has publicly challenged this theory, asserting he does not believe the comet is artificial. The public interest in the comet has led to various sensational claims, which Krasnikov noted were unfounded.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory away from Earth and toward Jupiter, scientists will monitor its path. No further investigations or actions have been announced at this time.</p>
