      <h2>Breakthrough Listen focused technosignature searches on 3I/ATLAS as it neared Earth</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, prompting the Breakthrough Listen project to search for signs of technology or artificial intervention in the comet. The comet flew past Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometers, and no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event has drawn significant interest from the scientific community, particularly regarding the potential for discovering extraterrestrial life. The Breakthrough Listen project, which investigates intelligent extraterrestrial communications, took the opportunity to analyze 3I/ATLAS for technosignatures during its flyby.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Comet discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Organizations involved:</strong> Breakthrough Listen, SETI Institute</li>
    <li><strong>Signals detected:</strong> Nine signals deemed human-made</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first reported on July 1, 2025. The comet approached Earth and made its closest flyby on December 19, 2025. During this time, the Breakthrough Listen project conducted searches for technosignatures, while another team studied the comet's non-gravitational acceleration. The findings from Breakthrough Listen have since indicated that 3I/ATLAS exhibits typical cometary characteristics.</p>

<p>The SETI Institute also participated in the observation, using the largest steerable single-dish radio telescope in the world to check for alien signals. Although they identified nine signals, further analysis revealed they were human-made radio noise.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS exhibits mostly typical cometary characteristics, including a coma and an elongated nucleus. There is currently no evidence to suggest that ISOs are anything other than natural astrophysical objects,” the Breakthrough Listen team stated in their recent paper, which is yet to be peer-reviewed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Similar technosignature searches have recently been undertaken by S. Z. Sheikh et al. (2025) and D. J. Pisano et al. (2025) over different frequency ranges and with different sensitivities. Like those searches, we find no credible detections of narrowband radio technosignatures originating from 3I/ATLAS,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been a topic of debate since its discovery, with some scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, advocating for exploration into its potential technological aspects. However, the recent flyby has shifted claims regarding the comet's origin, indicating that it is likely a natural object.</p>

<p>Previous searches for technosignatures have produced similar results, with scientists finding no credible evidence of extraterrestrial technology in other interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further studies and observations of 3I/ATLAS are expected as scientists continue to analyze data from the flyby. The Breakthrough Listen project and SETI Institute will likely publish additional findings as they complete their reviews.</p>
