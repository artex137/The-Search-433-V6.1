      <h2>Pulsar like heartbeat intrigues astronomers in interstellar comet 3I/Atlas heading to Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, the third interstellar object confirmed by science, has drawn attention due to its unique brightness pattern that repeats every 16 hours as it approaches Earth. The closest passage is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of 273 million kilometers, according to NASA.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it offers a rare opportunity to study the formation of other stellar systems. Astronomers have noted that the pulse is caused by the rotation of the comet's nucleus, which releases gases from frozen areas exposed to the Sun. NASA has confirmed that there is no risk of collision with Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 1.8 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Comet travels at speeds up to 68 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth as of now: 2.1 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Brightness pattern observed every 16 hours due to rotation.</li>
    <li>Comet's core estimated to be a few kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>Initial studies suggest the comet is over 7 billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was first identified on July 1, 2025, through observations made in Chile. The object followed a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar status. The comet reached perihelion, or its closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2025, when it was 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun.</p>

<p>Observations in November 2025 recorded the comet's brightness cycle accurately, using data from multiple observatories. Telescopes captured images revealing its ice- and dust-rich composition. By December 2, 2025, telescopes in Hawaii confirmed the 16-hour cycle of brightness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The pulse observed in Comet 3I/Atlas is attributed to natural processes, primarily the sublimation of ice,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This phenomenon is akin to a celestial electrocardiogram, suggesting internal cycles for orbit corrections,” proposed an astrophysicist from Harvard.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is significant for its ability to provide insights into interstellar chemistry, similar to previous interstellar objects like Oumuamua and Borisov. The object’s composition differs from local comets, highlighting the diversity of galactic materials. Initial studies published in December 2025 ruled out technological origins for the brightness pattern due to the lack of additional evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/Atlas approaches Jupiter in March 2026, astronomers will monitor the comet for potential changes in its brightness pattern due to gravitational influences. The scientific community continues to analyze data and prepare for its visibility from the Northern Hemisphere, where amateur astronomers can track it via applications like Stellarium until January 2026.</p>
