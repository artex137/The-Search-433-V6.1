      <h2>3I/ATLAS: What today’s ‘Manhattan-size’ interstellar visitor really means</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS is currently making its closest approach to the Sun, reaching a distance of approximately 130 million miles (210 million kilometres) while passing about 170 million miles (273 million kilometres) from Earth. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This interstellar object, the third known visitor from beyond our solar system, is on a hyperbolic trajectory and is not bound to the Sun. While it will not be visible from Earth due to solar glare, several spacecraft are positioned to gather data as it travels back into interstellar space. According to a report in the New York Post, the significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to provide insights into the chemistry and structure of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> 130 million miles (210 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> 170 million miles (273 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Current visibility:</strong> Not visible from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Spacecraft observing:</strong> NASA’s Psyche, Lucy, ESA’s JUICE</li>
    <li><strong>Data relay delay:</strong> Expected to lag by months from JUICE</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been on a hyperbolic path through the solar system, making its closest approach to the Sun today. As it nears perihelion, it will begin to fade from view, but several spacecraft are ready to collect data on its characteristics.</p>

<p>As it continues its journey, 3I/ATLAS is expected to slingshot back into interstellar space, providing opportunities for observation and analysis from various space missions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, has argued that 3I/ATLAS exhibits unusual behaviour, including reports of non-gravitational acceleration and a colour shift. However, NASA has stated, “3I/ATLAS presents no hazard, and there’s no confirmed evidence it is anything other than a natural interstellar object.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the notable interstellar visitors ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have provided valuable information about the formation and behaviour of interstellar bodies. The study of such objects is essential for refining models that assess potential hazards from future interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away from the Sun, scientists expect to receive data from deep-space missions, followed by lab analyses and research papers detailing its behaviour. Further observations from planetary orbiters may also clarify its characteristics and any unusual features.</p>
