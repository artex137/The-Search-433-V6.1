      <h2>UFO over Disney World Florida? Couple says mysterious orb was definitely 'aliens'</h2>

<p>A couple has reported seeing a mysterious glowing orb in the sky over Disney World's Epcot in Florida this week. Morgan Huelsman, digital director of The Bobby Bones Show, and her boyfriend witnessed the object while waiting for fireworks on a patio. They described the orb as "definitely a UFO with aliens."</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it adds to the ongoing discussion about unidentified flying objects, particularly in areas near NASA launch sites. Authorities have not initiated any investigations into the sighting at this time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Disney World's Epcot, Florida</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Morgan Huelsman and her boyfriend</li>
    <li>Event occurred: This week (exact date not disclosed)</li>
    <li>Object description: Glowing orb, not identified as a drone or satellite</li>
    <li>Video posted on social media: Yes</li>
    <li>Previous related sightings: Notable incidents in December 2022</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>While waiting for fireworks at Epcot, Huelsman and her boyfriend noticed a bright object in the sky. They initially thought it might be a drone or satellite. After searching online for information about the sighting and finding none, Huelsman captured a video of the orb and shared it on social media.</p>

<p>The video quickly gained traction and sparked discussions about UFOs, with Huelsman asserting that it was "definitely a UFO with aliens." The incident coincides with frequent reports of unusual lights in the sky near the park.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It was never moving,” said The Bobby Bones Show's X account regarding the object's behavior.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Disney World has a history of reported UFO sightings, likely due to its proximity to NASA launch sites. On August 18, SpaceX launched several Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral, approximately 95 kilometres from Disney World. This event led to speculation that the lights seen could be debris from the launch. Additionally, visitors have previously reported seeing glowing objects in the sky, such as a red orb in December 2022, coinciding with a Falcon 9 rocket launch.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, there are no planned investigations into the sighting. Experts suggest that frequent rocket launches in Florida's clear skies contribute to the misidentification of lights as UFOs.</p>
