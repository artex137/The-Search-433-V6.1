      <h2>3I/ATLAS Catastrophe: Elon Musk's Warning on Joe Rogan's Podcast - Earth in Grave Danger If Comet Hits</h2>

<p>Elon Musk has warned that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could pose a catastrophic threat to Earth if it were to collide with the planet. Speaking on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Musk indicated that such an impact could potentially wipe out an entire continent. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this warning.</p>

<p>This warning has raised public concern, although experts, including NASA, have stated there is no immediate danger. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has confirmed that the comet's trajectory is well-tracked and does not intersect with Earth's orbit, ensuring it will remain far away from the planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is well-tracked and poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA.</li>
    <li>Musk suggested that an impact could obliterate a continent and kill most of humanity.</li>
    <li>The comet is believed to contain high levels of nickel.</li>
    <li>NASA states the comet will come as close as the orbit of Mars.</li>
    <li>Musk dismissed the idea that 3I/ATLAS is an alien spacecraft, attributing its nickel content to natural occurrences.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recently, Elon Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience, where he discussed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. He warned of the catastrophic potential of an impact with Earth. NASA confirmed that the comet's path does not intersect with Earth's orbit, alleviating immediate fears of collision. Despite this reassurance, Musk emphasized the need for ongoing monitoring of such interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away, coming only about as close as the orbit of Mars,” said NASA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“No, there are definitely comets and asteroids which are primarily made of nickel,” Musk stated regarding the composition of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It could be aliens, I don't know,” Musk added when discussing the potential for extraterrestrial life.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Experts have noted that while 3I/ATLAS is intriguing due to its composition and origin outside the solar system, it is not the first interstellar object to be monitored by NASA. Continuous observation of such objects is critical for understanding potential threats to Earth and for advancing scientific knowledge about the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects to ensure they do not pose a threat to Earth. Musk's comments highlight the importance of ongoing scientific observation and collaboration in space research.</p>
