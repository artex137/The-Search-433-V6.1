      <h2>Alien or Just a Comet? All Questions Could Be Answered as 3I/ATLAS Fly by Earth</h2>

<p>Experts are examining the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it prepares for its closest flyby of Earth on 19 December 2025. The object, first detected on 1 July 2025 and having passed the Sun on 29 October 2025, will come within approximately 270 million kilometres, or 1.8 astronomical units, of Earth.</p>

<p>This flyby is significant for researchers, as they hope to gather crucial data that could clarify the comet's unusual characteristics. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has stated that the upcoming observations may resolve longstanding questions about 3I/ATLAS, including its strange colour shifts and jet formations. Scientists are preparing a series of tests to study the comet's plume, speed, and rotation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS detected on 1 July 2025</li>
  <li>Passed the Sun on 29 October 2025</li>
  <li>Closest flyby to occur on 19 December 2025</li>
  <li>Distance from Earth will be approximately 270 million kilometres (1.8 AU)</li>
  <li>Key observations expected to include plume, colour, speed, and jets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025. After moving past the Sun on 29 October 2025, the comet is now travelling outward again. The upcoming flyby on 19 December 2025 is anticipated to provide important data.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has indicated that significant findings are likely during this event, as instruments will be able to track changes in the comet's behaviour, which have not been seen in previous known comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The physics behind the anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS is unclear." He added, "This moment offers the best chance yet" to resolve the mysteries surrounding the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb has identified multiple anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS that have sparked interest and debate in the scientific community. These include its unusual retrograde path, mass, and chemical composition. The peculiar behaviour of its jets and colour shifts after perihelion have led to questions about whether it behaves like a typical comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the December flyby approaches, researchers are preparing to conduct thorough studies of 3I/ATLAS. The data collected may clarify many of the uncertainties surrounding this interstellar object and potentially reshape our understanding of similar phenomena.</p>
