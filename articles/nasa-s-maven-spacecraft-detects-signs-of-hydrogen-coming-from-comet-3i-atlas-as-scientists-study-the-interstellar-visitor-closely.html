      <h2>NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft detects signs of hydrogen coming from comet 3I/Atlas as scientists study the interstellar visitor closely</h2>

<p>NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft has detected signs of hydrogen emanating from comet 3I/Atlas during a monitoring period that began on September 27, 2025. The spacecraft, which typically studies the atmosphere of Mars, focused on the interstellar comet for about 10 days as it moved behind the Sun, making it difficult for ground-based telescopes to observe.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it enhances scientists' understanding of the comet's composition and behavior. Researchers have utilized various spacecraft across the Solar System to track 3I/Atlas due to its temporary obscuration by the Sun. MAVEN’s observations are crucial, as they provide insights into the chemical makeup of this unusual visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>MAVEN monitored comet 3I/Atlas for about 10 days starting September 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is an interstellar object, making it one of only three known to visit our Solar System.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Swift Observatory previously detected traces of hydroxyl gas around the comet.</li>
    <li>MAVEN's ultraviolet camera (IUVS) captured images revealing hydrogen and deuterium in the comet's coma.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas passed closest to Mars in early October 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 27, 2025, MAVEN began observing comet 3I/Atlas as it moved behind the Sun. During this period, MAVEN utilized its ultraviolet camera to capture images of the comet. These observations included detecting hydrogen and estimating the ratio of hydrogen types, including deuterium.</p>

<p>In early October 2025, 3I/Atlas made its closest approach to Mars, allowing MAVEN to map hydrogen and hydroxyl in the comet's coma. This data has provided crucial information about the comet’s composition and potential origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Detecting hydrogen helps scientists understand what the comet is made of and how it behaves when sunlight heats it,” NASA scientists stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This is only the beginning, and more study is needed to understand the details,” they added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is notable for being only the third known object from outside our Solar System to pass through ours. Previous interstellar objects have provided valuable insights into the differences between star systems. The ongoing study of 3I/Atlas contributes to this growing body of knowledge.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers expect to gather more images from other telescopes as comet 3I/Atlas continues its approach toward Earth in the coming months. This ongoing observation will further enhance understanding of this interstellar visitor.</p>
