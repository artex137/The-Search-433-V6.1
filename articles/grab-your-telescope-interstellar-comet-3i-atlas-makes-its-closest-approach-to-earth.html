      <h2>Grab Your Telescope! Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas Makes Its Closest Approach To Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas will pass within <strong>267 million kilometres</strong> of Earth on <strong>Friday</strong>, marking its closest approach during its journey through the solar system. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's visit.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for astronomers and enthusiasts to observe a comet that originated from another star system. NASA is actively monitoring 3I/Atlas with its space telescopes, encouraging backyard astronomers to take advantage of this fleeting chance to view the comet before it fades from visibility.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is estimated to be between <strong>440 metres</strong> and <strong>1,100 metres</strong> in size.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass within <strong>267 million kilometres</strong> of Earth on <strong>Friday</strong>.</li>
    <li>It will come much closer to Jupiter in <strong>March</strong>, at a distance of <strong>53 million kilometres</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered by NASA's Atlas telescope in <strong>Chile</strong> in <strong>July</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach interstellar space in the <strong>mid-2030s</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in <strong>July</strong> 2023 by NASA's Atlas telescope while searching for potentially hazardous asteroids. As it approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers have focused their observations on this unique interstellar visitor.</p>

<p>In <strong>March 2024</strong>, 3I/Atlas will make a close pass by Jupiter, coming within <strong>53 million kilometres</strong> of the gas giant.</p>

<p>After its close approach, the comet will continue on its trajectory into interstellar space, not returning to the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet may have originated in a star system much older than ours, making it a tantalizing target for study,” said Paul Chodas, director of NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets, like 3I/Atlas, are distinct from comets originating within our solar system. The first confirmed interstellar visitor was discovered in <strong>2017</strong>, followed by another in <strong>2019</strong>. These comets provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of star systems across the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its journey, NASA will maintain its observations until the comet fades from view. Astronomers hope to gather as much data as possible before it departs for interstellar space.</p>
