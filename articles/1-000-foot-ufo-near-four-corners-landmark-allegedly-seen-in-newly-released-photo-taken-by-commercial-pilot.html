      <h2>‘1,000-foot UFO’ near Four Corners landmark allegedly seen in newly released photo taken by commercial pilot</h2>

<p>A new photo claiming to show a 1,000-foot-wide UFO has emerged from a panel hosted by former Department of Defense employee Luis “Lue” Elizondo in Washington, D.C., on May 1, 2025. The photo was reportedly taken by a commercial pilot in 2021 while flying at 6,400 metres (21,000 feet) near the Four Corners region, which connects New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it comes amid ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and government transparency. The UAP Disclosure Fund, which organized the panel, has claimed that the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community possess hundreds of similar classified images and sensor files. They are advocating for full declassification and scientific analysis of these materials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Photo allegedly taken by a commercial pilot in 2021.</li>
    <li>Reported altitude of 6,400 metres (21,000 feet) near Four Corners.</li>
    <li>Object estimated to be between 183 and 305 metres (600 to 1,000 feet) in diameter.</li>
    <li>Panel included U.S. Representatives Anna Paulina Luna, Tim Burchett, and Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb.</li>
    <li>Elizondo has faced criticism for presenting evidence that has been debunked in the past.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 1, 2025, during a UAP Disclosure Fund panel in Washington, D.C., Luis “Lue” Elizondo released an alleged photo of a UFO. The photo was said to have been captured in 2021 by a commercial pilot flying at an altitude of 6,400 metres (21,000 feet). Critics quickly challenged the authenticity of the photo, suggesting it could depict irrigation circles common in desert areas.</p>

<p>In the same panel, Elizondo discussed the existence of classified UAP images held by the Department of Defense. The panel included discussions on various alleged alien species, as presented by Eric Davis, another member of the panel.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Several speakers confirmed [Department of Defense] and [Intelligence Community] hold hundreds of similar UAP images + sensor files still classified,” the UAP Disclosure Fund stated on X.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Elizondo mentioned, “I could not vouch for the veracity of this photograph, because I didn’t take it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a trend of increasing public interest in UAPs and government disclosure efforts. Past claims of UFO sightings and evidence have often been met with skepticism and debunking from experts. Noted UAP debunker Mick West has previously challenged claims made by Elizondo and others, citing inconsistencies in presented evidence.</p>

<p>Recent discussions in Congress have focused on funding for UAP research, with the UAP lobby requesting $1 billion in taxpayer funds for further investigations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The UAP Disclosure Fund is pushing for further declassification of UAP materials, while critics continue to scrutinize the validity of the claims made during the panel. The outcome of these discussions and potential funding remains to be seen.</p>
