      <h2>Elon Musk addresses 3I/ATLAS and alien possibilities on Joe Rogan's show</h2>

<p>Elon Musk has discussed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on The Joe Rogan Experience, raising questions about its origins and the potential for extraterrestrial life. The conversation occurred on October 29, 2023, as the comet made its closest approach to the Sun. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS has attracted significant attention from both scientists and the public. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring the comet, which is expected to re-emerge in early December for renewed observations. The discussions highlight the divide between natural explanations and speculative theories about the comet's origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS appeared in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Detected a radio signal on October 29, 2023, during its closest approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Signal was traced to hydroxyl radicals in the comet’s coma.</li>
    <li>Expected to re-emerge from behind the Sun in early December 2023.</li>
    <li>Size estimated to be similar to New York City.</li>
    <li>Only the third interstellar body recorded entering the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS first appeared on astronomers' radars in July 2023. The comet has displayed unusual behavior, prompting discussions among scientists about its nature. On October 29, 2023, a radio signal was detected during its closest approach to the Sun. Researchers quickly determined the signal's source was natural, linked to chemical reactions in the comet’s coma.</p>
<p>NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS is expected to re-emerge in early December 2023, which will allow for further observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If I was aware of any evidence of aliens… you have my word, I will come on your show and reveal it on the show,” Musk told Rogan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Professor Brian Cox described 3I/ATLAS as a “pristine lump of rock and ices” likely billions of years old.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate over 3I/ATLAS has highlighted the ongoing tension between scientific inquiry and speculation about extraterrestrial life. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested a "30 to 40 percent" chance that the object is not naturally formed, while most astronomers maintain that the evidence supports natural explanations. The comet's size and behavior have contributed to heightened public interest and speculation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it re-emerges in December 2023. Investigations will focus on understanding its composition and behavior, while public interest in potential alien connections is expected to persist.</p>
