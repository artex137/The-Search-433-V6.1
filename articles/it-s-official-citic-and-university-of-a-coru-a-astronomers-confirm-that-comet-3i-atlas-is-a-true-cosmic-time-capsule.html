      <h2>It's official - CITIC and University of A Coruña astronomers confirm that comet 3I/ATLAS is a true cosmic time capsule</h2>

<p>Astronomers from the Center for Research in Information and Communication Technologies (CITIC) and the University of A Coruña have confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS is a cosmic time capsule, revealing its origins from another stellar system. The announcement was made following the comet's detection on July 1, 2023, from Chile, utilizing the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it allows researchers to reconstruct the comet’s trajectory over the past 10 million years, providing insights into the materials that formed around other stars. The findings challenge existing theories about solar system formation and interstellar material evolution. Authorities in the scientific community are prioritizing the study of interstellar objects, as they offer valuable information about the origins of planets and the conditions that contribute to life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Detection date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Detection location:</strong> Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Will not come closer than 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Research institutions:</strong> CITIC and University of A Coruña</li>
    <li><strong>Data source:</strong> Gaia mission of the European Space Agency (ESA)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in Chile. Following its detection, astronomers from CITIC and the University of A Coruña utilized data from the Gaia mission to analyze the comet's trajectory. They have since reconstructed its journey over the past 10 million years, revealing its origins from a distant stellar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Each interstellar comet is like an open window to the past of the Universe,” said Xabier Pérez Couto from CITIC. “It allows us to analyze materials formed around other stars, under conditions very different from those of the Sun. It is a unique opportunity.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets have historically been viewed as relics of the past. Interstellar comets, such as 3I/ATLAS, provide even more significant insights as they are remnants of the original material from which planets formed around other stars. Their study offers clues about the formation of worlds and the emergence of organic compounds.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interstellar objects become a priority for the European scientific community, researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS and similar comets to gain a deeper understanding of the universe and its origins.</p>
