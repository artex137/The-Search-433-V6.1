      <h2>President George H.W. Bush 'knew' of 1964 alien contact with humans in New Mexico: documentary</h2>

<p>Former President George H.W. Bush reportedly confirmed an alien contact with humans at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico in 1964, according to a recent documentary. The film, “The Age of Disclosure,” features testimony from Eric Davis, an astrophysicist who worked as a scientific advisor for the now-disbanded Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). The documentary premiered on Amazon Prime on November 22, 2025.</p>

<p>This revelation raises questions about the U.S. government's long-held secrets regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and potential extraterrestrial encounters. The documentary claims that several U.S. officials have direct knowledge of alien existence and that current bureaucratic structures may prevent full disclosure of this information.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: “The Age of Disclosure”</li>
    <li>Premiere date: November 22, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of alleged encounter: Holloman Air Force Base, Otero County, New Mexico</li>
    <li>Testimony provided by: Eric Davis, former AATIP scientific advisor</li>
    <li>Type of encounter: Alleged face-to-face meeting with an alien entity</li>
    <li>Injuries reported: Burns and internal scarring among military personnel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1964, George H.W. Bush allegedly learned of an alien contact at Holloman Air Force Base. In 2003, he reportedly discussed the incident with Eric Davis during a series of private conversations. The documentary “The Age of Disclosure” was released on November 22, 2025, detailing these claims and featuring various officials discussing their knowledge of UFOs.</p>

<blockquote>“One of them landed on the tarmac and a non-human entity deboarded the craft that landed and interacted with uniformed Air Force and civilian CIA personnel,” said Eric Davis during the documentary.</blockquote>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities and it’s not ours,” said then-Senator Marco Rubio. “And we don’t know whose it is. That alone deserves inquiry, attention, and focus.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If you have objects in the sky that you cannot identify — that’s a problem. Because it could be China, it could be Russia, it could be any adversary,” said Senator Kristin Gillibrand (D-NY).</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary highlights a supposed secretive government program, referred to as the “Legacy Program,” involved in the retrieval of UFOs and alien bodies. According to Davis, the program operates under various government agencies, including the CIA and the U.S. Air Force, and has kept its findings from even the highest levels of government. This has led to concerns among lawmakers about national security implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The documentary aims to advance the UFO disclosure movement, prompting ongoing discussions about potential investigations into the claims made within the film. Future inquiries may focus on the implications of unidentified aerial phenomena and their potential threats to national security.
