      <h2>President George H.W. Bush ‘knew’ of 1964 alien contact with humans in New Mexico: documentary</h2>

<p>Former President George H.W. Bush reportedly confirmed an alien contact incident at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico in 1964, according to testimony from astrophysicist Eric Davis in a new documentary titled “The Age of Disclosure.” The documentary, directed by Dan Farah, premiered on Amazon Prime on Friday.</p>

<p>This revelation has sparked renewed interest in government secrecy regarding UFOs and potential alien encounters. The documentary alleges that Bush was informed of the incident after his presidency, and highlights the role of various U.S. agencies in the ongoing investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in 1964 at Holloman Air Force Base, Otero County, New Mexico.</li>
    <li>Eric Davis claims Bush discussed the incident during private conversations in 2003.</li>
    <li>Three spaceships reportedly approached the base, with one landing and an alien entity emerging.</li>
    <li>The documentary features claims of injuries sustained by military personnel from UAP encounters.</li>
    <li>The "Legacy Program," a top-secret UFO-retrieval operation, allegedly involves the CIA, U.S. Air Force, and other agencies.</li>
    <li>Sen. Kristin Gillibrand expressed concerns about unidentified objects in U.S. airspace.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1964, three spaceships allegedly approached Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. An interstellar being reportedly emerged from one of the crafts and had a face-to-face encounter with military and CIA officials. Eric Davis claims he discussed these events with George H.W. Bush in a series of private conversations in 2003.</p>

<p>The documentary “The Age of Disclosure” premiered on Amazon Prime on Friday, featuring claims from various U.S. officials about the existence of aliens and their visits to Earth. The film also outlines potential injuries sustained by military personnel who interacted with UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities and it’s not ours. And we don’t know whose it is. That alone deserves inquiry, deserves attention, deserves focus,” said an unnamed official in the film.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I think that there’s this assumption that presidents can walk into the Oval Office on day one and say ‘Alright, take me to Roswell...’ I think that really is a naive understanding of how our government works,” the official added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sen. Kristin Gillibrand stated, “If you have objects in the sky that you cannot identify — that’s a problem. Because it could be China, it could be Russia, it could be any adversary.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This documentary follows a history of U.S. government secrecy regarding UFOs, including prior incidents and the establishment of programs like the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. The film argues that the existence of the "Legacy Program" and its operations have been kept from even the highest levels of government, prompting concerns about national security.</p>

<p>The documentary suggests that there are deeper implications regarding unidentified aerial phenomena, with officials warning that these could represent threats from foreign adversaries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The documentary aims to advance the UFO disclosure movement, with hopes that it will encourage further investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena and government transparency regarding their encounters with extraterrestrial entities.</p>
