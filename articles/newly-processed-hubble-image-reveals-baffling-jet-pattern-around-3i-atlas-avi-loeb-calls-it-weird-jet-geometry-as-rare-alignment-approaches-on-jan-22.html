      <h2>Newly Processed Hubble Image Reveals Baffling Jet Pattern Around 3I/ATLAS – Avi Loeb Calls It ‘Weird Jet Geometry’ As Rare Alignment Approaches On Jan. 22</h2>

<p>Newly analyzed images from the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed unusual jet patterns around the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, with observations captured on January 14, 2026. The findings indicate the object is displaying a jet configuration that does not conform to known cometary behavior.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as scientists prepare for a rare Earth-Sun alignment on January 22, which could provide further insights into the behavior of 3I/ATLAS. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb and his collaborators have stated that the object’s jets challenge existing models of solar radiation and outgassing.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li>Observation Date: January 14, 2026</li>
  <li>Alignment Date: January 22, 2026</li>
  <li>Distance of dust environment: over 130,000 kilometers</li>
  <li>Rotation cycle of jet structure: approximately seven hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 14, 2026, astronomers captured new images of 3I/ATLAS using the Hubble Space Telescope. These observations revealed a unique jet pattern, including an "anti-tail" directed towards the Sun and three smaller jets arranged symmetrically around the object.</p>
<p>Earlier Hubble data from December 2025 indicated that the jet system wobbles, suggesting a rotating body. The findings challenge previous assumptions about comet behavior as the jets do not point away from the Sun as expected.</p>
<p>As January 22 approaches, scientists are preparing for a significant alignment that could clarify the nature of the material forming the anti-tail and its resistance to solar forces.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb noted, “Whatever is driving the object’s jet system appears to be both persistent and structured, traits that demand careful examination rather than dismissal as noise or imaging artifacts.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unprecedented among known cometary objects. Previous research has primarily focused on solar system bodies, making this interstellar visitor a unique case that challenges established theories. The observations suggest that materials from outside the solar system can interact differently with solar radiation and heat.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As researchers await the January 22 alignment, they aim to gather critical measurements that could reveal the composition of the anti-tail and enhance understanding of interstellar objects. Observations during this period may provide valuable data to test competing explanations for 3I/ATLAS's unusual behavior.</p>
