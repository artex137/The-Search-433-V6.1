      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Object Larger Than Expected, Scientists Reveal Findings</h2>

<p>The 3I/ATLAS interstellar object, first detected by NASA on July 1, has been found to be significantly larger and more massive than previous estimates suggested. This discovery has drawn global scientific interest due to its unique trajectory and characteristics, which distinguish it from other known interstellar objects.</p>

<p>Scientists have monitored 3I/ATLAS closely since its detection to study its path through the solar system and analyze its physical properties. The findings have implications for understanding cosmic formation and behavior, as well as the potential for interstellar exploration.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was detected by NASA on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>It has a mass exceeding <strong>33 billion tons</strong>.</li>
    <li>The diameter of its solid-density nucleus is estimated to be more than <strong>5 kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is projected to pass within <strong>1.67 million miles</strong> of Mars' orbit.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object after 1I/âOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023, by NASA. Following its discovery, researchers, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have conducted detailed observations of its motion and behavior. Initial studies revealed its unusual mass and size, prompting further scrutiny and analysis.</p>

<p>On July 17, 2023, a paper was published by Loeb and colleagues proposing that 3I/ATLAS may not be entirely natural, suggesting it could be a technological artifact from an extraterrestrial civilization.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The rarity of detecting an object of this size suggests that we should have found many more similar to ‘Oumuamua before encountering 3I/ATLAS." The unusual trajectory and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have prompted heightened scrutiny among scientists.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins the ranks of only two other known interstellar objects, 1I/âOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, highlighting its unique nature. The scientific community has been intrigued by the differences between these objects and typical comets or asteroids found in the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, examining its interactions with planets and collecting data to further understand its composition and trajectory.</p>
