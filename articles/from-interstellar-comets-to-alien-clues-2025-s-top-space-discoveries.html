      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Discovered as Interstellar Visitor</h2>
<p>Astronomers have confirmed the discovery of comet 3I/ATLAS, first observed by the Chilean Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System on July 1, 2025, near the constellation Sagittarius. The comet, which has a hyperbolic trajectory indicating it originated from interstellar space, has been tracked moving at a speed of 36 miles per second, the fastest recorded for a comet to date.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it not only enhances our understanding of interstellar objects but also provides insights into the composition of comets from outside our solar system. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have monitored 3I/ATLAS during its solar conjunction, and scientists have noted its chemistry resembles that of solar system comets. Ongoing tracking is set to continue into 2026 to further analyze its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery by Chilean Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet's trajectory is hyperbolic, indicating interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>Speed recorded at 36 miles per second, the fastest for any comet.</li>
    <li>Monitoring conducted by NASA and ESA during solar conjunction.</li>
    <li>Comet displays a rare "anti-tail" pointing toward the Sun.</li>
    <li>Tracking to continue into 2026 for further analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers at the Chilean Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System first observed comet 3I/ATLAS. The initial observations established its hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin. As the comet approached, NASA and ESA spacecraft began monitoring it, especially during the solar conjunction period.</p>

<p>Throughout the latter half of 2025, scientists analyzed the comet's chemical composition. They discovered that it contained slightly more nickel than iron, suggesting a distinct origin from its star system. The comet's unique "anti-tail" was also documented, further contributing to the understanding of its behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I/ATLAS provides a rare opportunity to study the chemistry of an interstellar comet and its implications for our understanding of the cosmos,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of comet 3I/ATLAS adds to a growing body of evidence regarding interstellar objects. Prior discoveries, such as 'Oumuamua in 2017, have sparked interest in studying celestial bodies that originate outside our solar system. These findings challenge existing theories about the formation and evolution of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Tracking of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue into 2026 as scientists aim to understand its full composition and origins. Further observations may yield additional insights into the nature of interstellar comets and their role in the broader context of cosmic evolution.</p>
