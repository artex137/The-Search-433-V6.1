      <h2>NASA Monitors Mysterious Comet 3I ATLAS</h2>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has initiated monitoring of Comet 3I ATLAS, a celestial object exhibiting unusual characteristics since its discovery. The comet, which is approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) in diameter, has garnered attention due to its anomalous behavior and the presence of a metal compound not typically found in comets.</p>

<p>This monitoring effort is significant as it involves collaboration with the United Nations-endorsed International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), which aims to assess the potential impact of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) on Earth. The detection of nickel tetracarbonyl, a compound previously associated with human industrial processes, has prompted further investigation into the comet's nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS is approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet emits a plume containing 4 grams of nickel per second.</li>
    <li>IAWN has begun a Comet Astrometry Campaign from 27 November 2025 to 27 January 2026.</li>
    <li>The object has demonstrated a non-gravitational acceleration and an anti-tail.</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien probe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS was discovered recently, and its peculiarities have been under investigation. NASA has been monitoring the object since its discovery due to its unusual behavior. The IAWN announced a Comet Astrometry Campaign scheduled to begin on 27 November 2025, coinciding with the comet's closest approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>Dr. Avi Loeb has raised concerns regarding the comet's trajectory and composition, suggesting it could be an artificial object rather than a natural celestial body.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To prepare for the campaign, we will hold a workshop on techniques to correctly measure comet astrometry,” the IAWN announced.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Avi Loeb stated, “If 3I/ATLAS is a massive mothership, it will likely continue along its original gravitational path and ultimately exit the Solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of unusual compounds in celestial bodies has raised questions about the nature of such objects. Previous investigations have focused on the behavior of NEOs, but 3I ATLAS's peculiarities have led to speculation about its origins and purpose.</p>
<p>The IAWN operates as a global coalition to detect and monitor potentially hazardous NEOs, enhancing planetary defense capabilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The upcoming Comet Astrometry Campaign aims to refine observation techniques and better understand the trajectory of Comet 3I ATLAS. Further investigations will continue as scientists assess the implications of the findings surrounding this mysterious object.</p>
