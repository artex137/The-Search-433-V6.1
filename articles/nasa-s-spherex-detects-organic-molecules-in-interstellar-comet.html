      <h2>NASA’s SPHEREx Detects Organic Molecules In Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>NASA’s SPHEREx space telescope has detected organic molecules in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during observations made in December 2025. This comet is only the third such object ever observed passing through the solar system.</p>

<p>The findings are significant as they enhance understanding of materials formed beyond the Sun’s influence. Scientists are now analysing the implications of the detected organic compounds, which include methanol, cyanide, and methane, to better understand their origins and potential implications for life in the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed by SPHEREx in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Organic molecules detected include methanol, cyanide, and methane.</li>
    <li>Comet first identified in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx launched in March 2025, managed by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</li>
    <li>Sublimation process linked to the comet's increased brightness.</li>
    <li>Cometary activity noted nearly two months after its closest approach to the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. It was confirmed as an interstellar object due to its extreme velocity and trajectory. In March 2025, NASA launched the SPHEREx mission to map the cosmos and search for ingredients of life. SPHEREx conducted observations of the comet shortly after its closest approach to the Sun in December 2025.</p>

<p>Following the closest approach, scientists reported a delayed brightening of the comet nearly two months later, attributed to sublimation of ices as heat penetrated deeper into the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The delayed venting suggests that deep, previously unexposed ices began erupting well after peak solar heating,” said a member of the research team. “This highlights how space telescopes can capture rare opportunities to study material from distant star systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, with only two other such objects observed before 3I/ATLAS. The detection of organic molecules in these comets can provide insight into the potential for life beyond Earth. The SPHEREx mission aims to enhance our understanding of the cosmos and the ingredients necessary for life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyse data from SPHEREx to further investigate the composition of comet 3I/ATLAS and its implications for understanding organic materials in the universe.</p>
