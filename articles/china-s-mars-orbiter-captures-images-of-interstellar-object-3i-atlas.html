      <h2>China's Mars orbiter captures images of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The Tianwen-1 orbiter of China's Mars mission has captured images of the interstellar object coded 3I/ATLAS, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA). This observation took place between October 1 and 4, 2023, when the spacecraft was approximately 30 million kilometers from the object.</p>

<p>This achievement marks the first time a Chinese spacecraft has captured images of an interstellar object. Scientists believe that 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by a telescope in Chile, formed around ancient stars near the center of the Milky Way. The object is estimated to be between 3 and 11 billion years old, potentially making it older than the solar system. The findings are expected to provide valuable insights into the composition and evolution of exoplanets and the early history of stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Dates:</strong> October 1 to 4, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Tianwen-1:</strong> 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> 3 to 11 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Mission Duration:</strong> Tianwen-1 has been operational for approximately 4 years and 8 months</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by a telescope in Chile. The Tianwen-1 orbiter, launched in July 2020, entered Mars' orbit in February 2021 and began preparations for the observation of 3I/ATLAS in early September 2023. From October 1 to 4, the orbiter successfully captured images of the object, sending data back to Earth for analysis.</p>

<p>During this period, researchers created an animation based on a series of images taken over 30 seconds, showcasing the object's movement through space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Because 3I/ATLAS follows a hyperbolic orbit, unlike the elliptical orbits of objects around the Sun, it clearly originates from beyond the solar system and will eventually move away from it," said Liu Jianjun, chief designer of the ground application system for China's first Mars exploration mission.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "The successful observation proves the long-term reliability of our orbiter. Tianwen-2 probe will also explore small, faint celestial objects, and we hope to build on this experience to test technology and accumulate expertise for future deep-space missions," Liu added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Tianwen-1 mission, which includes an orbiter, lander, and rover, has been pivotal in advancing China's capabilities in space exploration. Capturing the faint 3I/ATLAS represents a significant technical achievement and serves as a valuable test for the upcoming Tianwen-2 mission, which aims to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid and explore a main-belt comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data collected from the observation of 3I/ATLAS will be used for further scientific study. The Tianwen-2 mission, launched in May 2023, will build on the experiences gained from this observation as it prepares for its own exploration of celestial objects.</p>
