      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Solar System</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, weighing 33 billion tons with a nucleus measuring 3.1 miles, is currently speeding through the solar system. Detected by NASA's ATLAS system in July, the comet is set to pass within 1.67 million miles of Mars on October 3, 2023.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the largest interstellar object ever recorded, according to astronomer Avi Loeb from Harvard University. The comet, which originated from the constellation Sagittarius, poses no threat to Earth and is primarily composed of frozen carbon dioxide and water ice, as confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS weighs 33 billion tons.</li>
  <li>Nucleus diameter is 3.1 miles.</li>
  <li>Detected by NASA's ATLAS system in July 2023.</li>
  <li>Will pass within 1.67 million miles of Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
  <li>Confirmed as mostly frozen CO2 with water ice.</li>
  <li>Third interstellar object ever spotted, after 'Oumuamua (2017) and Borisov (2019).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, NASA's ATLAS system detected the comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, scientists have confirmed its composition and trajectory. As it approaches the Sun, the comet has begun to exhibit a green hue, indicating a change in its evolution, as reported by the European Southern Observatory.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2023, the comet is scheduled to make its closest approach to Mars. Following this, it will continue its path around the solar system, passing by Jupiter and Venus before disappearing behind the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “3I/ATLAS is the largest interstellar visitor ever recorded,” said Avi Loeb from Harvard University.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “Something has switched on in its evolution,” noted scientists from the European Southern Observatory regarding the comet's changing appearance.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS marks a significant advancement in astronomical observations, being only the third interstellar object detected. Previous interstellar visitors, 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>These findings can enhance our understanding of interstellar space and the potential for other similar objects to enter the solar system in the future.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars and its subsequent trajectory through the solar system. Further observations will likely provide additional data on its composition and behavior during its close encounters with other planets.</p>
