      <h2>NASA to Share Unreleased Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS in Live Event</h2>

<p>NASA has announced it will release previously unseen images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a live event on November 19, 2025, at 3 p.m. EST from the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The event will be streamed on NASA’s apps, website, YouTube channel, and Amazon Prime.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it comes amid speculation about the comet's origins and its peculiar characteristics. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has noted at least 12 anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, prompting discussions about whether it is a natural comet or something more unusual. The release of these images follows a delay attributed to the U.S. government shutdown, which has raised questions and conspiracy theories on social media.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date and Time:</strong> November 19, 2025, at 3 p.m. EST (20:00 GMT)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Streaming Platforms:</strong> NASA apps, website, YouTube channel, Amazon Prime</li>
    <li><strong>Image Request:</strong> Images requested by Avi Loeb from NASA’s Mars observer HiRISE</li>
    <li><strong>Public Engagement:</strong> Use of #AskNASA for on-air questions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered as the third known object from outside our solar system to pass through the solar system. The comet flew past Mars in early October 2025.</p>
<p>In mid-November 2025, NASA announced a live event to share imagery of the comet, following public interest and academic scrutiny regarding its unusual features.</p>
<p>On November 17, 2025, NASA confirmed the event details through social media, encouraging public participation and questions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“On Wed., Nov. 19 at 3 p.m. EST, we’re hosting a live event to share new imagery of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, collected by our fleet of @NASA space missions!” — NASA Solar System</blockquote>
<blockquote>“A visitor from beyond our solar system is making headlines! Join @NASA experts Wednesday, November 19, at 3 p.m. EST for the latest updates and imagery on comet 3I/ATLAS.” — NASA Science</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet has generated significant interest due to its unusual characteristics, which have led to various conspiracy theories regarding its nature. The interaction between NASA’s interim administrator Sean Duffy and celebrity Kim Kardashian has also fueled speculation on social media.</p>
<p>Previous comments from Avi Loeb have suggested that the comet's anomalies warrant further investigation, contributing to ongoing debates within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to address public questions during the live event and provide insights into the images of 3I/ATLAS. Further analysis and discussions may follow the event based on public and scientific interest in the comet’s features.</p>
