      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Approaches the Sun</h2>

<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS is making its way toward the sun, with telescope observations revealing a growing tail. The latest images, taken by the Gemini South telescope in Chile, were released on September 5, 2025, and show the comet's extended tail and wide coma of dust and gas.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers, as 3I/ATLAS is set to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be 167 million miles away. Scientists are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory, with calls for NASA to adjust the courses of existing space probes to observe it further. Experts suggest that studying 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into the characteristics of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at 137,000 miles per hour (220,000 kilometers per hour).</li>
    <li>As of September 5, 2025, it was 238 million miles (384 million kilometers) from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass closest to Earth in December at a distance of 167 million miles (268 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>The images were captured by the Gemini South telescope in Chile, late last month.</li>
    <li>Dr. Mark Norris has confirmed that the images indicate 3I/ATLAS is indeed a comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Late August 2025: The Gemini South telescope captures detailed images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing a growing tail and coma.</p>
<p>September 5, 2025: The images are publicly released, showcasing the comet's features and confirming its classification as a comet.</p>
<p>December 2025: 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass closest to Earth at a distance of 167 million miles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These new images very clearly demonstrate that 3I/ATLAS is a comet,” said Dr. Mark Norris.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet is a messenger from another star system, and by studying their light and colour, we can begin to understand the diversity of worlds beyond our own,” stated Dr. Matthew Genge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If we are visited by a technological object like 3I/ATLAS — it could either visit us or release some mini-probes that arrive to Earth and appear as UAP,” warned Avi Loeb during a podcast.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar comets, which originate from outside the solar system. The comet's approach has sparked interest in its potential to provide information about other star systems. The National Space Foundation’s NoirLab has noted that the comet is becoming increasingly active as it nears the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, with discussions underway about adjusting the paths of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Jupiter’s Juno probe for further observation.</p>
