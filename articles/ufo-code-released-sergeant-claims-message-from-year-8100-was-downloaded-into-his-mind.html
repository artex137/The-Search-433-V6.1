      <h2>UFO Code Released: Sergeant Claims Message From Year 8100 Was 'Downloaded' Into His Mind</h2>

<p>A decades-old UFO claim linked to a US military base in England has resurfaced, as allegations of a coded message from the year 8100 allegedly implanted in the mind of a US Air Force sergeant have gone viral in the United States. The claim revolves around a binary sequence reportedly received during the Rendlesham Forest incident in December 1980, and it continues to incite debate among UFO researchers and sceptics.</p>

<p>This renewed attention follows tabloid coverage and widespread circulation on social media platforms. Authorities have not validated the specific claim of a 'downloaded' message, and it remains unsupported by official investigations into the Rendlesham Forest sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in December 1980 near RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters in Suffolk.</li>
    <li>Multiple service personnel reported unusual lights in the forest.</li>
    <li>Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston claimed to have encountered a triangular craft.</li>
    <li>Binary code allegedly downloaded into Penniston's mind has not been independently verified.</li>
    <li>No physical evidence has been produced to support the claim.</li>
    <li>No branch of the US military or UK Ministry of Defence has validated the alleged UFO code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 1980, the Rendlesham Forest incident unfolded near two military bases operated by the United States Air Force. Over several nights, personnel reported seeing lights and unusual activity in the forest. An official memorandum from Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt documented these events.</p>

<p>Years later, Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston claimed he encountered a triangular craft and stated that touching the object resulted in a transmission of information in the form of binary code. This detail was not included in his earlier statements.</p>

<p>In subsequent years, Penniston wrote down the binary sequence from memory and decoded it, leading to claims of a message referencing humanity and exploration, including the phrase 'Origin Year 8100'. Critics have highlighted the delayed disclosure of this information as a reason for its controversy.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No branch of the US military, the UK Ministry of Defence or any scientific body has validated the existence, decoding or origin of the alleged UFO code.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Rendlesham Forest incident is often referred to as 'Britain's Roswell' due to its military context and the number of witnesses involved. It gained international attention, and despite official assessments concluding no threat to national security, the case remains unresolved.</p>

<p>Public fascination with UFOs, now termed unidentified anomalous phenomena, has increased in recent years, prompting governments to release historical files and hold public hearings. Cases like Rendlesham are being revisited by new audiences as a result.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The claim of a message from the year 8100 remains disputed and unconfirmed. Investigations into the Rendlesham Forest incident are not currently ongoing, and no further assessments have been announced.</p>
