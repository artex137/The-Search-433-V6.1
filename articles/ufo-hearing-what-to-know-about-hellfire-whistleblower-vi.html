      <h2>UFO Hearing: What to Know About Hellfire Whistleblower Video</h2>

<p>A congressional hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), commonly referred to as UFOs, took place on Tuesday, featuring a previously unseen video. The hearing, aimed at promoting transparency and supporting whistleblowers, included statements from several lawmakers and experts regarding the implications of UAP sightings.</p>

<p>Authorities are investigating claims related to UAPs, particularly following the release of the video that depicts an MQ-9 drone tracking an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen. The video reportedly shows the object surviving an impact from a Hellfire missile, raising concerns and questions about the nature of these encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: Tuesday, October 3, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: U.S. Congress</li>
    <li>Video date: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Type of drone: MQ-9</li>
    <li>Missile type: Hellfire missile</li>
    <li>Video source: Whistleblower, according to Rep. Eric Burlison</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the hearing, Rep. Eric Burlison introduced a video that he claimed was obtained from a whistleblower. The video shows an MQ-9 drone tracking an unidentified object, which was later struck by a Hellfire missile. Despite the missile's impact, the object appears to continue moving.</p>

<p>George Knapp, an investigative reporter, also spoke at the hearing. He noted that while he had heard about similar events, the video was not previously available to Congress or the public. He expressed frustration about the lack of access to such materials and emphasized the need for public transparency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are here today to listen to the stories of those who have witnessed events of interest to the American people and to support the policies that cultivate an environment that welcomes and protects whistleblowers,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Enough is enough,” said Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican. “I wanna cue up a video that I’ve been given... You’ll see that another MQ-9 launched a Hellfire missile.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There are servers where there’s a whole bank of these kind of videos that Congress has not been allowed to see,” said George Knapp. “The public should be seeing this stuff, and why you’re not allowed to, I don’t know.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing follows previous discussions about UAPs, including a significant hearing in 2022 that raised alarms about the potential security threats posed by unidentified objects in the sky. The ongoing dialogue emphasizes the need for greater transparency regarding UAP encounters and the government's response to such incidents.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims surrounding UAPs are ongoing, with an independent review of the video reported by Rep. Burlison currently in progress. Further hearings and discussions are expected as lawmakers seek to address public concerns and enhance transparency regarding these phenomena.</p>
