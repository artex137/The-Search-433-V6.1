      <h2>3I/ATLAS hiding pristine material and is no longer a relic of the past — Study examines NASA data</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has studied NASA observations of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing significant changes in its composition due to its long interstellar journey. The findings were published recently on the preprint server arXiv and highlight the comet's unusual carbon dioxide to water ratio. The study suggests that the comet is a battered version of itself after billions of years in space.</p>

<p>This research is important as it sheds light on the composition of interstellar objects and their potential to provide insights into other star systems. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionisation, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) have contributed to understanding the comet's behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observations conducted by JWST and SPHEREx.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>The ratio of carbon dioxide to water is 7.6 ± 0.3, exceeding solar system trends by 4.5σ.</li>
    <li>Study posted on arXiv by a team from Belgium and the USA.</li>
    <li>Galactic cosmic rays are believed to have altered the comet's composition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent observations, astronomers noted that 3I/ATLAS exhibits an unusual carbon dioxide to water ratio. The JWST and SPHEREx have recorded this anomaly, indicating a high level of CO2 in the comet's coma. The study published on arXiv provides a detailed analysis of the comet's composition, suggesting that it has been significantly altered during its journey.</p>

<p>Researchers proposed several hypotheses to explain the findings, with the most viable being the influence of galactic cosmic rays converting carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide over billions of years.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "JWST/NIRSpec measurements show CO2/H2O = 7.6 ± 0.3, placing 3I/ATLAS 4.5σ above solar system trends at the observed heliocentric distance," the authors stated.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "Rather than being pristine messengers from distant planetary systems, interstellar objects may instead carry signatures of processed material shaped by Gyr-scale cosmic-ray exposure," the authors added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS contributes to the broader understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. Previous studies have indicated that such objects carry information about their formation and the conditions in their original stellar environments. The alterations observed in 3I/ATLAS may suggest that other interstellar visitors have also been affected in similar ways during their transit to the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further research is expected to focus on the implications of these findings for the study of interstellar objects. Scientists will continue to analyze data from JWST and other telescopes to explore the nature of materials present in these celestial bodies.</p>
