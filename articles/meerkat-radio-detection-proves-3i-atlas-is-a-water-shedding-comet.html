      <h2>MeerKAT Radio Detection Proves 3I/ATLAS Is A Water-Shedding Comet</h2>

<p>A radio detection from the MeerKAT array has confirmed that interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, ending speculation about its nature. The detection occurred on 24 October 2025, when South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope recorded hydroxyl (OH) absorption lines from the object.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it provides direct evidence that 3I/ATLAS is outgassing volatile materials, a behavior consistent with comets. NASA's Swift Observatory corroborated the MeerKAT results, detailing that the object is shedding water-related molecules, further solidifying its classification as a comet rather than an artificial structure.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detection made on 24 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Location: MeerKAT array, Karoo, South Africa.</li>
    <li>Hydroxyl absorption lines detected at frequencies of 1,665 and 1,667 MHz.</li>
    <li>NASA's Swift Observatory confirmed findings and reported water-production rates of tens of kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>Research led by DJ Pisano and collaborators; results published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 24 October 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected hydroxyl absorption lines from 3I/ATLAS. This occurred while the comet was positioned near the Sun, making optical observations challenging. Following this, NASA's Swift Observatory confirmed the detection and provided additional details on the comet's water activity.</p>

<p>In July and August 2025, the Swift Observatory had already reported OH emission, indicating water activity at significant distances from the Sun. These findings were later summarized in peer-reviewed literature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, a co-author on the Swift study. “This discovery forces scientists to rethink how volatile materials survive and evolve in objects formed around other stars.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Detecting OH in multiple regimes is exactly the smoking gun we needed,” an astronomer stated, emphasizing the importance of accumulated evidence in scientific research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This breakthrough in understanding 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar objects. Previous interstellar comets have revealed unexpected characteristics, prompting scientists to reconsider models of how materials are formed and evolve in different stellar environments.</p>

<p>The recent findings highlight the importance of multi-wavelength astronomy, which combines optical, ultraviolet, and radio observations to clarify ambiguous scientific claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the Solar System, researchers will conduct coordinated observations from both ground and space to refine their understanding of its composition and structure. Further studies may reveal additional insights into the materials forming around distant stars.</p>
