      <h2>Pentagon map unlocks mystery of hundreds of UFO orbs regularly invading US military bases</h2>

<p>A report from the crowdsourced UFO-spotting app Enigma has revealed that between 2022 and 2025, users have reported hundreds of sightings of mysterious metallic spheres near military facilities in California, New York, and Arizona. The majority of these sightings occurred during the early hours, with 422 detailed observations recorded between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. within five miles of military installations.</p>

<p>This report matters as it highlights a significant trend in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) near sensitive military areas. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is currently examining these reports, which may indicate a need for further investigation into potential security risks associated with these sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Over 8,000 UFO reports made in the U.S. between December 2022 and June 2025.</li>
    <li>422 sightings of metallic spheres documented, primarily between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m.</li>
    <li>Most sightings occurred within five miles of military facilities in California, New York, and Arizona.</li>
    <li>AARO documented 757 cases of UAP from May 2023 to June 2024, with 21 classified as unexplained.</li>
    <li>43% of reports noted the appearance of light; 40% described low flying; 35% indicated rapid movement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between December 2022 and June 2025, Enigma users have submitted over 8,000 UFO reports, with a focus on metallic spheres. The AARO has been actively investigating these phenomena since its establishment, documenting 757 cases from May 2023 to June 2024. The report from Enigma has emerged amid ongoing discussions regarding UAP and their implications for national security.</p>

<p>In June 2024, AARO classified 21 of the documented cases as unexplained, further emphasizing the need for systematic analysis of such phenomena. The office continues to evaluate these sightings and their potential origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While classic disc-shaped UFOs dominated mid-20th century sightings, orb-shaped UAP have emerged as one of the most frequently reported modern phenomena on Enigma,” the report stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Despite official statements and competing theories, their origin and purpose remain unknown,” the report acknowledged.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior incidents of UFO sightings have raised questions about airspace security, especially near military installations. The emergence of orb-shaped UAP has shifted the focus from traditional disc-shaped UFOs, prompting further inquiries from both military and civilian observers. There is growing interest in understanding the nature and implications of these sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO will continue its investigations into the reported sightings of metallic orbs. Further analysis may lead to the development of policies regarding airspace security and potential identification of the objects involved.</p>
