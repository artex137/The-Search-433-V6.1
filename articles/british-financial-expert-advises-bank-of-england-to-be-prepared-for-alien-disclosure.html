      <h2>British Financial Expert Advises Bank of England to be Prepared for Alien Disclosure</h2>

<p>A British financial expert has advised the Bank of England to prepare for potential alien disclosure, according to a letter sent on January 21, 2026. Helen McCaw, a former senior analyst at the Bank of England, addressed her concerns to Andrew Bailey, the head of the institution. McCaw stated that the United States is in the process of declassifying and disclosing information regarding a technologically advanced non-human intelligence linked to the UFO phenomenon.</p>

<p>This recommendation highlights the growing seriousness with which authorities view the UFO phenomenon. McCaw argues that if such a disclosure occurs, world leaders may face a power or intelligence beyond governmental control, which could lead to significant psychological and economic repercussions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Even if you feel it’s very unlikely, it’s madness not to consider it and plan accordingly,” McCaw wrote to Bailey.</blockquote>
