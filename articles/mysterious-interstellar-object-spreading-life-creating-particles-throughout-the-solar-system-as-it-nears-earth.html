      <h2>Mysterious interstellar object spreading life-creating particles throughout the solar system as it nears Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been detected releasing methanol and hydrogen cyanide, substances that may contribute to the formation of life, as it approaches Earth, with a close pass scheduled for December 19, 2025. The object, classified as a comet by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), will come within 170 million miles of Earth, but has already passed closer to several other celestial bodies this year.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may offer insights into the origins of life on Earth and other planets. Scientists, including Harvard Professor Avi Loeb, have suggested that these chemicals could facilitate a process called panspermia, where life-building materials hitch a ride on comets and eventually reach planets or moons. Authorities are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory as it continues to release these potential building blocks of life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Close approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Key substances detected:</strong> Methanol and hydrogen cyanide</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approaches:</strong> 18 million miles from Mars, 60 million miles from Venus, 33 million miles from Jupiter (March 2026)</li>
    <li><strong>Previous solar pass:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been flying through the solar system and has made notable passes by various celestial bodies. It passed the sun on October 29, 2025. Recent scans from the ALMA telescope in Chile have identified the release of methanol and hydrogen cyanide from the comet.</p>
<p>As the object nears the sun, it has shown an increase in gas emissions, with hydrogen cyanide primarily emanating from its core, while methanol is produced from both the core and its trailing gas cloud.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS could end up playing the role of a 'friendly gardener,' seeding our solar system with new life,” said Avi Loeb, reflecting on the potential implications of the comet's chemical releases.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The unique flight path through the solar system suggests that the object was intentionally guided,” Loeb added, referring to the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Scientists have long debated the origins of life on Earth, with some theories suggesting that life began with microbes delivered via meteorites and comets. The detection of life-building substances in 3I/ATLAS adds a new dimension to this discussion, reinforcing the concept of panspermia as a viable explanation for life's emergence.</p>
<p>Prior to this discovery, 3I/ATLAS was already noted for its peculiar features, including a cometary tail pointing in the wrong direction and a color change as it approached the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and other planets. Further studies are expected to explore the implications of its chemical emissions and the potential for life-seeding events in the solar system.</p>
