      <h2>NASA Baffled by Strange Object Near the Sun: Shocking New Photo of Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Alien Theories</h2>

<p>A new photo of comet 3I/ATLAS, shared on 20 October 2023, has raised questions among scientists and space enthusiasts regarding its unusual features as it approaches the sun. The image was posted by a space enthusiast on X, who noted a circular shape protruding from the comet, sparking theories about its composition and potential links to alien life.</p>

<p>The significance of this discovery has drawn attention from both the scientific community and the public. Authorities, including NASA and Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb, are investigating the comet's unusual emissions, which may include a rare alloy. Dr. Loeb has suggested that the presence of nickel tetracarbonyl, typically associated with human industrial processes, is unprecedented in comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was photographed on 20 October 2023 at coordinates 13 48 57.33 - 08 25 54.3.</li>
    <li>The image shows a circular shape and no visible tail, which is uncommon for comets.</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb reported that the comet emits four grams of nickel tetracarbonyl per second.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first photographed by the Hubble telescope on 21 July 2023.</li>
    <li>Nickel tetracarbonyl is typically found in human manufacturing, not in comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 21 July 2023, the Hubble telescope captured the first images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing its unusual characteristics.</p>
<p>In August 2023, the Keck II telescope took additional photographs, which were released the following week, showing the comet emitting a plume.</p>
<p>On 20 October 2023, a new image of 3I/ATLAS was shared on X, prompting further speculation and investigation into its properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is only one place where that is known to exist and that is in industrially produced nickel alloys,” said Dr. Loeb regarding the rare alloy emissions from 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We usually see beautiful tails extending from the object away from the sun, and in this case there was no evidence for such a tail,” Dr. Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Typically, comets contain significant amounts of nickel and iron. Previous comets observed in recent years have displayed these common mineral contents. The unusual findings related to 3I/ATLAS challenge existing knowledge about comet composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers at the Keck Observatory are conducting further studies to better understand the phenomenon associated with 3I/ATLAS. Ongoing investigations aim to clarify the comet's unique emissions and their implications for our understanding of cometary science.</p>
