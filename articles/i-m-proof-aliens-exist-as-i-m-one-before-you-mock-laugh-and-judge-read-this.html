      <h2>Rosanna Hanness Claims to Be an Alien Living on Earth</h2>

<p>Rosanna Hanness, a 47-year-old former recruitment worker from Brighton, East Sussex, has claimed she is an extra-terrestrial, stating her first proof came as a child through intense emotions and premonitions. Hanness, who identifies as a "starseed," believes her soul originated from another planet and that she is on Earth to help humanity.</p>

<p>This claim has drawn both skepticism and curiosity. Hanness asserts that her role is to aid people with various challenges, including finances, health, and relationships.
