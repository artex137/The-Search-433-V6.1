      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Speeds Through the Solar System</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, identified as 3I/ATLAS, is currently traversing the solar system on a high-speed trajectory. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, this comet is the third interstellar visitor ever detected by astronomers. It reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 210 million kilometers.</p>

<p>The unique characteristics of comet 3I/ATLAS have captured the attention of scientists worldwide. Its unusual chemical composition and lack of a prominent tail have prompted global observatories to study its origins, estimated to be between 7 and 14 billion years old. NASA is leading a coordinated observation campaign involving multiple instruments and space missions to gather more data on this cosmic object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, at the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) occurred on October 29, 2025, at 210 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Currently traveling at approximately 244,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Predicted safe approach to Earth in December 2025 at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Close encounter with Venus on November 2025, passing 97 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>Close encounter with Jupiter in March 2026, passing 54 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>Composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with a proportion eight times greater than water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third interstellar visitor detected. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025. Since then, its speed has significantly increased, confirming its trajectory out of the solar system.</p>

<p>In the coming months, 3I/ATLAS will pass close to Venus and Jupiter, with the Earth encounter expected in December 2025. These events will provide further opportunities for scientific observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The absence of a well-defined tail differentiates 3I/ATLAS from other comets, raising questions about its classification and physical processes,” said a representative from NASA. </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the detection of previous interstellar objects, including 2I/Borisov. Its unique attributes have reignited scientific discussions surrounding the composition and behavior of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and international space agencies will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and other planets. Ongoing observations are crucial to understanding its origins and characteristics.</p>
