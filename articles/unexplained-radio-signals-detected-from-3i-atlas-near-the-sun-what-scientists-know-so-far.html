      <h2>Unexplained radio signals detected from 3I/Atlas near the Sun — what scientists know so far</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected unexplained radio signals from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS using the MeerKAT radio telescope at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory on October 24, 2025. This marks the first confirmed radio signal from 3I/ATLAS, which behaves differently from typical comets.</p>

<p>The detection of these signals is significant as it may provide insights into the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS. Researchers are now planning further investigations to explore the object. According to Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, the signals were caused by hydroxyl radicals and were identified as faint dips in radio waves.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detection date: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: South African Radio Astronomy Observatory</li>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Radio frequencies detected: 1.665 GHz and 1.667 GHz</li>
    <li>Doppler velocity shifts: approximately -15.6 km/s</li>
    <li>Next planned observation: March 16, 2026, by NASA’s Juno spacecraft</li>
    <li>Distance from Jupiter during next pass: 53 million km</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was observed on October 24, 2025, when it was 3.76 degrees away from the Sun. This observation came shortly after the comet’s close approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, which occurred on October 30, 2025. Earlier attempts to detect signals in September 2025 were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The detection on October 24 was significant as it revealed two radio absorption lines caused by hydroxyl radicals. The findings were documented in Loeb's blog, detailing the Doppler velocity shifts and the conditions under which the signals were detected.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The two lines revealed absorption at Doppler velocity shifts of -15.59 (+/-0.16) and -15.65 (+/-0.17) kilometers per second, respectively,” wrote Avi Loeb. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass within 53 million kilometers from Jupiter. At that time, the Juno spacecraft will use its dipole antenna to search for a radio signal from 3I/ATLAS at low frequencies ranging from 50 hertz to 40 megahertz,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS in 2025 has generated interest among scientists due to its unusual behavior compared to known comets. Previous radio signals, such as the Wow! Signal detected in 1977, have drawn comparisons to this new finding. Loeb has noted that the arrival direction of 3I/ATLAS coincides with the Wow! Signal’s direction, raising questions about a potential connection.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS for additional radio signals, with the next observation scheduled for March 16, 2026, as the object approaches Jupiter.</p>
