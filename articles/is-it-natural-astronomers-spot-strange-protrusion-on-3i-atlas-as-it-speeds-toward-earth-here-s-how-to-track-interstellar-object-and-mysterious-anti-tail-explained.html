      <h2>Is it natural? Astronomers spot strange protrusion on 3I/ATLAS as it speeds toward Earth</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected a strange protrusion on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach set for December 19, 2023. The object will pass at a distance of about 267 to 274 million kilometres, posing no risk to Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery has raised questions about the object’s behavior and origin. Astronomers around the world are studying 3I/ATLAS to understand this unusual feature, known as an “anti-tail.” The phenomenon challenges traditional comet models and has spurred discussions on the potential nature of the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object will pass at a distance of about 267 to 274 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at approximately 220,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>The object is believed to be an interstellar comet that formed outside the solar system.</li>
    <li>Astronomers observed the strange protrusion using ground and space telescopes since July 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since July 2023, astronomers have utilized various telescopes to observe 3I/ATLAS. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope first noted the protrusion on July 21. A subsequent image from the Teerasak Thaluang telescope in Thailand on December 13 confirmed the protrusion's persistence more than a month after the object passed its closest point to the Sun.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS passed within 209 million kilometres of the Sun earlier this year, allowing for detailed observations. NASA released new images of the comet on November 19, showcasing further details of its structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The feature is not caused by viewing angle,” said Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb. “It is a physical jet.” 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The object behaves like a comet,” stated UCLA astronomer David Jewitt. “The heated day side ejects dust toward the Sun.” 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There is no alien threat,” said NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy. “No technosignatures have been detected,” added NASA science chief Nicola Fox. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual appearance of 3I/ATLAS has prompted discussions in the scientific community regarding the behavior of interstellar objects. Previous observations of comets have noted similar dust enhancements, leading many scientists to reject claims of alien origins for the object.</p>

<p>Past comet studies have shown that larger dust grains are not easily influenced by solar wind, further supporting the notion that the observed features of 3I/ATLAS align with known comet behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The public is encouraged to participate in local skywatching events to observe the object, which will remain visible with small telescopes until spring 2026.</p>
