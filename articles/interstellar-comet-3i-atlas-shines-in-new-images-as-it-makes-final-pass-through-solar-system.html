      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shines in new images as it makes final pass through solar system</h2>

<p>Space agencies have released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it makes its final pass through the inner solar system. The comet, discovered in late June and confirmed in July, is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometers).</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object. Spacecraft operated by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have been collecting data and images of the comet, which is traveling at an estimated speed of 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h). The new images show the comet actively releasing gas and dust after its recent encounter with the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in late June 2023 and confirmed in July.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at approximately 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of the comet on November 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>ESA's Juice spacecraft observed the comet on November 2, 2023, from about 41 million miles (66 million kilometers) away.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between 1,400 feet (440 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) across.</li>
    <li>The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to observe the comet as it approaches Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in June 2023 and confirmed as an interstellar object in July. It has since traveled through the solar system, making close approaches to Mars and the sun in October. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope took an image of the comet on November 30, 2023, revealing its nucleus and coma. ESA's Juice spacecraft captured images on November 2, 2023, while observing the comet from a distance.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Each dataset is valuable for understanding an object arriving from outside the solar system,” a NASA spokesperson stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study material formed around a distant star. The comet is the largest interstellar object detected to date and adds to the growing understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists expect to receive additional observations from various spacecraft, including the James Webb Space Telescope, as 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>
