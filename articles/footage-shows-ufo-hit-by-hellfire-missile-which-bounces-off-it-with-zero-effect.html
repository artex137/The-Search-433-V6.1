      <h2>UFO Survives Hellfire Missile Strike During Military Hearing</h2>

<p>A UFO was struck by a Hellfire missile travelling at nearly 1,600 km/h and continued flying unharmed off the coast of Yemen, according to footage presented at a congressional hearing. The incident, involving a US Air Force MQ-9 drone, has raised questions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and their implications for national security.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights ongoing concerns regarding UAPs and military encounters. Authorities are now facing pressure to enhance transparency about such incidents, with calls for the public to have access to previously classified information regarding UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred off the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>A Hellfire missile was launched from a military drone.</li>
    <li>The missile struck the UFO and exploded without causing damage.</li>
    <li>Footage was presented during a congressional hearing on military encounters with UAPs.</li>
    <li>Witnesses included Congressman Eric Burlison and UFO investigator George Knapp.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the congressional hearing, Congressman Eric Burlison described the incident involving the UFO and the missile strike. He confirmed that a military drone tracked the object before launching the missile. The footage showed the missile impacting the UFO, which then continued to fly unaffected.</p>

<p>In addition to this incident, testimonies from other military personnel were presented, detailing prior encounters with UAPs, further substantiating the ongoing discourse about the presence of such phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “That’s a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bouncing right off. And it kept going. What the hell is that?” – George Knapp, UFO investigator.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I’m not going to explain it to you. You’ll see exactly what it does.” – Congressman Eric Burlison.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We cannot maintain trust in government if we keep American people in the dark.” – Anna Luna, chair of the Congress task force on the declassification of federal secrets.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader series of military encounters with UAPs that have garnered attention in recent years. Various military personnel have reported sightings of unidentified objects exhibiting flight capabilities beyond known technology. Congressional hearings have increasingly focused on these encounters, emphasizing the need for declassification and public transparency.</p>

<p>Prior incidents, such as those reported by US Air Force veteran Dylan Borland and Navy personnel like Alexandro Wiggins, illustrate the ongoing nature of these phenomena and the growing demand for accountability from government authorities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP encounters are expected to continue, with potential recommendations for policy changes regarding transparency and reporting procedures. Congress is likely to pursue further hearings to address these issues and ensure public access to information on military encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
