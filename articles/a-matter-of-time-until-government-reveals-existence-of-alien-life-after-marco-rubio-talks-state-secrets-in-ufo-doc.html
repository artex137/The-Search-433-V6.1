      <h2>'A matter of time' until government reveals existence of alien life after Marco Rubio talks state secrets in UFO doc</h2>

<p>Dan Farah, director of the new UFO documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, has stated that it is only a matter of time until President Donald Trump confirms the existence of extraterrestrial life. The film, which premiered at South by Southwest in March, explores an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life.</p>

<p>Farah believes his film will pressure the president to disclose government knowledge about alien life. He has interviewed 34 US government officials and insiders, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Film premiered at South by Southwest in March 2023.</li>
    <li>Director Dan Farah interviewed 34 US government officials.</li>
    <li>144 Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) incidents reported between 2004 and 2021.</li>
    <li>Captain Robert Salas reported a UFO incident in 1967 at Malmstrom Air Force Base.</li>
    <li>US intelligence agencies required to provide an unclassified report on UAP as per a 2020 COVID-19 relief bill.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1967, Captain Robert Salas reported that a UFO hovered over his control facility at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, causing ten nuclear missiles to shut down. He described the incident as an "impossible" occurrence, suggesting a level of sophistication beyond human capabilities.</p>

<p>In March 2023, <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> premiered, showcasing interviews with government officials about UAP and extraterrestrial life. Farah expressed hope that the film would act as a catalyst for revealing government secrets.</p>

<p>Following the film's release, Farah stated that he has received information indicating that President Trump is aware of the facts concerning UAP and is taking steps to learn more.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I think it’s only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, ‘We’re not alone in the universe,’” said Dan Farah.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I can only speculate as to why it happened. This was a demonstration by an object of extraterrestrial origins,” said Captain Robert Salas regarding the 1967 incident.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “For too long, the public has blatantly been lied to, kept in the dark, and misled with a really sophisticated disinformation campaign,” Farah added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The history of UFO sightings and extraterrestrial activity in the US includes various incidents, such as the 1967 event reported by Captain Salas. In 2020, a COVID-19 relief bill mandated that US intelligence agencies provide unclassified reports on UAP, leading to increased public interest in the topic.</p>

<p>Farah’s documentary is part of a broader trend in which filmmakers and researchers seek to uncover government secrets related to UFOs and alien life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Farah hopes the release of <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> will prompt the US government to reveal more information about UAP and non-human intelligent life. He believes the public deserves to know the truth, as the stakes are high for everyone globally.</p>
