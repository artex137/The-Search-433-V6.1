      <h2>The Imminent Solar Conjunction of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On October 21, 2025, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS will reach solar conjunction, positioned directly behind the Sun from Earth's perspective. This alignment will prevent observation of 3I/ATLAS using Earth-based telescopes.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers and scientists studying 3I/ATLAS, which is suspected to be a natural comet. Authorities and researchers are preparing to monitor the object for unusual activities during and after this period, particularly around its perihelion on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be in solar conjunction on October 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will reach perihelion at a distance of 203 million kilometers from the Sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It has a minimum diameter of 5 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will pass within 64 million kilometers of 3I/ATLAS on November 4, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass within 54 million kilometers of Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. It is set to reach solar conjunction on October 21, 2025, blocking visibility from Earth-based telescopes. The object will then reach its perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 203 million kilometers from the Sun. Following this, ESA’s Juice mission will approach 3I/ATLAS on November 4, 2025. The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million kilometers. Finally, 3I/ATLAS will approach Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We expect to get data on 3I/ATLAS shortly after perihelion,” said Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been rated 4 on the Loeb scale due to its eight observed anomalies, including its trajectory alignment with the ecliptic plane and unusual gas composition. The object’s properties have raised interest among scientists, prompting careful observation during its upcoming solar conjunction.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will monitor 3I/ATLAS closely after perihelion for any unusual activity or new objects released from it, which could provide insights into its true nature.</p>
