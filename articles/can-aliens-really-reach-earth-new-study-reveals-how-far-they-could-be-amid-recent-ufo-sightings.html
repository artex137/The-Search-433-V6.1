      <h2>Can Aliens Really Reach Earth? New Study Reveals How Far They Could Be Amid Recent UFO Sightings</h2>

<p>A new study presented at the Europlanet Science Congress and the Division for Planetary Science in Helsinki in September 2025 has sparked renewed discussion about the existence of alien life. Researchers Manuel Scherf and Helmut Lammer from the Austrian Academy of Sciences have suggested that intelligent extraterrestrial life may exist, but could be located as far as 33,000 light-years from Earth.</p>

<p>This research raises significant questions about the possibility of linking recent UFO and UAP sightings to distant alien civilizations. The findings indicate that for contact to occur, such beings would need to survive for at least 280,000 years to overlap with humanity's timeline.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study presented in September 2025 at the Europlanet Science Congress in Helsinki.</li>
    <li>Research conducted by Manuel Scherf and Helmut Lammer of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.</li>
    <li>Advanced extraterrestrial life could be located as far as 33,000 light-years away.</li>
    <li>For contact to be possible, alien civilizations must survive at least 280,000 years.</li>
    <li>Earth has taken 4.5 billion years to support human life.</li>
    <li>Recent UFO sightings include a missile launch by China's military in Shandong province.</li>
    <li>Authorities have not disclosed explanations for the recent UFO sightings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 2025, researchers presented their study at the Europlanet Science Congress in Helsinki, focusing on the potential existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life. They concluded that such life may be located around 33,000 light-years from Earth, raising questions about the feasibility of contact.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, various UFO sightings have occurred, including footage of a missile launch aimed at an unidentified aerial object in Shandong province, China. Witnesses heard loud bangs and reported seeing a fireball intercepted by a bright light.</p>

<p>Additionally, videos have surfaced showing large lights flying in formation near Tulcingo de Valle, with some observers speculating they could be military drones or unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Although ETIs might be rare, there is only one way to really find out, and that is by searching for it,” said Manuel Scherf. “If these searches find nothing, it makes our theory more likely, and if SETI does find something, then it will be one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs ever achieved.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“At some point, enough carbon dioxide will be drawn from the atmosphere so that photosynthesis will stop working,” Scherf added during his presentation. “For the Earth, that's expected to happen in about 200 million to roughly one billion years.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study emphasizes the strict conditions required for alien life to thrive near Earth, including a stable carbon-silicate cycle and a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. These findings align with ongoing public interest in UFO sightings, which have sparked widespread debate about the potential for extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<p>Past incidents of UFO sightings have contributed to a growing fascination with the possibility of alien life, despite a lack of concrete evidence supporting such claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers and authorities will continue to investigate recent UFO sightings, while ongoing efforts in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) aim to uncover any potential signals from advanced civilizations. The study suggests that even a lack of findings can reinforce current scientific models regarding the rarity of extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
