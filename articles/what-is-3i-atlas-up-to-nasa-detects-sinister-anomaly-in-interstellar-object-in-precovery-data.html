      <p class="byline">Published 2025-09-02 10:43 UTC</p>

      <h2>NASA detects anomaly in interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>NASA has reported that interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has unexpectedly brightened, an event detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in May 2023, prior to its official observation in July. The object displayed a brightness increase five times greater than expected, raising questions among scientists about its nature.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing understanding of comet behavior. Researchers are analyzing the data to determine the implications of this anomaly and what it might mean for future studies of interstellar objects. NASA and other astronomical agencies are currently investigating the object's characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Initial detection by TESS: May 7, 2023</li>
    <li>Official observation by ATLAS: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Brightness increase: Five times between May 7 and June 3</li>
    <li>Speed: 221,000 km/hr</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth when brightness increased: Six times greater than the Earth's distance from the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 7, 2023, TESS detected 3I/ATLAS for the first time. Researchers later analyzed historical data and confirmed that the object had exhibited an unusual brightness increase between May 7 and June 3. Ten days before the official observation by ATLAS on July 1, the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile also detected the object. The subsequent analysis of this data allowed scientists to better estimate the orbit of 3I/ATLAS and confirm its interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The rapid brightness increase at such a distance is not typical for a comet,” said a NASA researcher involved with the study.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Some believe the object may be large and rotating, which could explain the anomaly,” noted a member of the research team.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Avi Loeb has suggested that the features observed may indicate it is not a naturally occurring object,” stated a colleague from Harvard University.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time 3I/ATLAS has raised eyebrows among scientists. Several anomalies have been noted in its behavior since its detection. The unusual brightness and trajectory of interstellar objects have prompted discussions about their origins and characteristics, with some researchers proposing that they could be artificial in nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and collaborating scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from TESS and other telescopes to further investigate 3I/ATLAS. Ongoing studies will focus on understanding the object's composition and trajectory, as well as addressing the implications of its anomalous brightness.</p>
