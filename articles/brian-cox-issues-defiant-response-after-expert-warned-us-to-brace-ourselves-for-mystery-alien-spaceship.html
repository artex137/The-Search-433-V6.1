      <h2>Brian Cox responds to warnings about comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>Astrophysicist Brian Cox has issued a response after Harvard scientist Avi Loeb suggested that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could potentially be an "alien spaceship." The comet, detected by NASA on July 1, 2023, has drawn attention from conspiracy theorists and scientists alike due to its mysterious origins and the speculation surrounding its capabilities.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the nature of objects entering our solar system. NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as interstellar due to its orbital path and has stated that it poses no threat to Earth. The comet is expected to pass within 170 million miles of our planet, with its closest approach to the Sun anticipated on October 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected by NASA on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 1.4 astronomical units (about 210 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>NASA states it poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Classified as the third interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, NASA detected comet 3I/ATLAS. The object has since sparked widespread speculation about its origins and nature. On October 30, 2025, the comet will reach its closest point to the Sun, approaching within 170 million miles of Earth.</p>

<p>In response to the speculation, Cox has publicly dismissed claims about the comet being a potential alien craft, describing it as a natural object composed of carbon dioxide and water ices.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Just to be clear - given recent drivel online - Comet 3I/ATLAS is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff. It is entirely natural in origin, its orbit is as expected and it will whizz around the sun and then disappear off into the galaxy again.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun around Oct. 30, 2025, at a distance of about 1.4 au (130 million miles, or 210 million kilometres) — just inside the orbit of Mars.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the detection of 3I/ATLAS, other interstellar objects have entered the solar system, stirring similar speculation and interest. The scientific community generally regards such objects as natural phenomena rather than extraterrestrial artifacts.</p>

<p>Loeb's claims about the comet being a "technological artefact" have been met with skepticism by many experts in the field, including Cox, who emphasizes the object’s natural composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. The scientific community will likely study the comet further to gain insights into its composition and origins as it passes through the solar system.</p>
