      <h2>ESA’s Juice Spacecraft Beams Back New Image of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>In November 2025, the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) captured a new image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, marking the second interstellar comet ever observed in our solar system. The image was taken using Juice’s Navigation Camera (NavCam) on November 2, just two days before the spacecraft's closest approach to the comet on November 4, at a distance of approximately 66 million km (41 million miles).</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insights into the comet's activity following its closest approach to the Sun. The data from Juice’s five scientific instruments will not arrive on Earth until February 2026, but researchers have expressed excitement over the initial image, which displays the comet's coma and possible tails.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet observed: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of image capture: November 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach: November 4, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 66 million km (41 million miles)</li>
    <li>Instruments used: JANUS, MAJIS, UVS, SWI, and PEP</li>
    <li>Expected data arrival: February 18 and 20, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 2, 2025, Juice captured an image of 3I/ATLAS using its NavCam. This was two days before the spacecraft's closest approach to the comet. During the approach on November 4, Juice was approximately 66 million km from 3I/ATLAS. The team plans to receive data from five scientific instruments on February 18 and 20, 2026, due to the spacecraft's current use of its main antenna as a heat shield.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Though the data from the science instruments won’t arrive on Earth until February 2026, our team couldn’t wait that long,” said members of the Juice team. “We decided to try downloading just a quarter of a single NavCam image to see what was in store for us.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The very clearly visible comet, surrounded by signs of activity, surprised us,” the team added. “Not only do we clearly see the glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet known as its coma, we also see a hint of two tails.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation follows previous studies of 3I/ATLAS, which was first identified as an interstellar comet. The data from Juice is expected to enhance understanding of the comet's composition and activity, particularly after its recent solar encounter.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will analyze the data from Juice’s scientific instruments upon its arrival in February 2026, providing further insight into the characteristics and behavior of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
