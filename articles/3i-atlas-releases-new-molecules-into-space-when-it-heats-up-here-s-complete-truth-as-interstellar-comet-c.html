      <h2>3I/ATLAS Releases New Molecules into Space</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest among astronomers as it travels through the solar system, having been detected in late June 2025. This comet is only the third confirmed visitor from outside the solar system, and it has shown increased activity as it nears the Sun. Observations indicate that as temperatures rise, the comet releases gases and dust into space, revealing new molecules.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS is crucial for understanding the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Scientists are using ground-based and space telescopes to track its motion, brightness, and chemical behavior. The findings provide insights into how such comets form, age, and travel across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected: Late June 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: Late October 2025</li>
    <li>Observations from Gemini North telescope on: November 26, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance of XMM-Newton observation: About 284 kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed of 3I/ATLAS: Approximately 210,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Comet's path: Hyperbolic orbit, will not return to the solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in late June 2025. As it approached the Sun, scientists noted increased activity beginning in late October. By November 26, observations from the Gemini North telescope revealed a shift in color from red to green, indicating new molecules were being released. On December 3, the ESA’s XMM-Newton observed interactions between the comet and solar wind.</p>

<h2>Official Statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The color shift shows new gases released after heating. Diatomic carbon emits green light when activated by sunlight, indicating chemical changes inside the comet,” according to a statement from NSF NOIRLab.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. It is believed to be the largest and possibly the oldest interstellar object observed to date. Previous studies of comets have shown similar behaviors when subjected to solar heating, contributing to the understanding of cometary science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories worldwide will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gather more data about its size, path, and chemical characteristics. Researchers aim to deepen their understanding of early star systems and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
