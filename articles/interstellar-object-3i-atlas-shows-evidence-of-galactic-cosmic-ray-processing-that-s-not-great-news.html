      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Shows Evidence Of "Galactic Cosmic Ray" Processing</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has found evidence of "galactic cosmic ray processing" in the spectra of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). This discovery indicates that the object may not provide the pristine information about its origin that scientists had hoped for.</p>

<p>This finding matters because it complicates the understanding of interstellar objects and their environments. Researchers have expressed concerns that the outer layers of 3I/ATLAS have been altered during its journey, potentially obscuring insights into the conditions of its original planetary system. The study is currently under review and has prompted further observations from telescopes around the world.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet has a high carbon dioxide to water ratio, measured at CO2/H2O = 7.6 ± 0.3.</li>
    <li>The study has not yet undergone peer review.</li>
    <li>Observations are being conducted by numerous telescopes worldwide.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers at ATLAS identified 3I/ATLAS as a large interstellar object moving through the Solar System. Subsequent observations confirmed its classification as a comet, revealing a distinct coma composed of ice and dust. In a recent study, researchers examined its chemical makeup and found a high ratio of carbon dioxide, suggesting exposure to galactic cosmic rays.</p>

<p>The implications of this research indicate that interstellar objects may carry signatures of processed material rather than pristine samples from their parent systems. The study's authors suggest that the outer layers of 3I/ATLAS may conceal information about its original environment.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things... It behaves like a comet. And so the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It’s a comet,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for Solar System small bodies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery is significant as it follows the identification of previous interstellar objects, which have provided insights into the materials and conditions found in other star systems. The processing of 3I/ATLAS by galactic cosmic rays raises questions about the reliability of such objects as direct messengers from distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations will be necessary to confirm the findings of the study and its implications for understanding interstellar objects. Researchers hope that additional data will help clarify whether pristine material can still be outgassed as 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, although this outcome is considered unlikely.</p>
