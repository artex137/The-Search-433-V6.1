      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS shows sudden increase in speed and changed colour</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed a sudden increase in speed and a change in colour of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. The phenomenon has garnered attention from astronomers worldwide, with NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) monitoring the comet closely. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this cosmic event.</p>

<p>The changes in 3I/ATLAS are significant as they challenge current understanding of comet behaviour. According to NASA JPL navigation engineer Davide Farnocchia, the comet is experiencing non-gravitational acceleration, suggesting forces beyond the Sun’s gravity are at play. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has indicated that this acceleration may be linked to the comet losing mass, potentially forming a plume of gas and dust.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2020 by a telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object after Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
    <li>As of October 29, the comet's speed has increased to 244,600 km/h.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth in December, passing within 269 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are tracking the comet's trajectory towards Jupiter, expected in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early September, astronomers began observing changes in 3I/ATLAS, noting that the comet was appearing bluer due to the visibility of its gas coma. On October 29, it was reported that the comet brightened sharply as it neared the Sun.</p>
<p>Throughout this period, astronomers have noted the comet's unusual behaviour, including the loss of its tail, which is typically formed by gas and dust released as a comet approaches the Sun.</p>
<p>In November and December, astronomers expect to see a significant plume of gas surrounding the comet as it continues to lose mass.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“About 13% of the comet’s mass should have formed a tail, yet no such tail is visible,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the unusual nature of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We don’t have any evidence for the gas coma changing colours,” stated Qicheng Zhang from the Lowell Observatory, clarifying the comet's observed colour changes.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Its behaviour has prompted discussions about the physical characteristics of comets and the potential implications for future research.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as Oumuamua, have also raised questions about their origins and compositions, leading to ongoing investigations into the nature of such cosmic visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. Scientists will analyze data from the comet’s mass loss and its unusual acceleration, aiming to gain insights into its composition and behaviour.</p>
