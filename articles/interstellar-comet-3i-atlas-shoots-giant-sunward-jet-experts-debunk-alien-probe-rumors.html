      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Shoots Giant Sunward Jet — Experts Debunk Alien Probe Rumors</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed ejecting a large jet of gas and dust toward the Sun, according to astronomers. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey, is currently moving through the inner Solar System and is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides researchers with a unique opportunity to study an object from beyond our Solar System. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and is behaving like a typical comet. The agencies have emphasized that the comet's trajectory is safe and that it will not come closer than approximately 1.8 AU (270 million km) to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS survey</li>
    <li>Current speed: ~58 km/s</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 1.8 AU (270 million km)</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29–30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at perihelion: ~1.4 AU from the Sun</li>
    <li>Jet length: ~10,000 km (6,200 miles)</li>
    <li>Composition: High CO₂ and water ice ratio (~8:1)</li>
    <li>Estimated age: Over 7 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025, as it approached the inner Solar System. Its hyperbolic orbit confirmed it as an interstellar object. On October 3, 2025, the comet made a close pass of Mars, coming within approximately 30 million km, where it was imaged by ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars orbiters. Observations from ground-based telescopes have revealed its active outgassing and the presence of a sunward jet.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to reach its perihelion on October 29–30, 2025, before continuing its path outwards, crossing Jupiter's orbit by March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet,” said ESA scientist Dr. Michael Küppers. “The comet poses no danger and offers a rare opportunity to study an interstellar visitor.”</blockquote>

<p>Jacqueline McCleary from Northeastern University noted, “Studying the composition of this comet gives us a window into conditions in another solar system.”</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the only known interstellar visitors were 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These objects have sparked interest among astronomers regarding the composition and behavior of materials from beyond the Solar System. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing understanding of interstellar bodies and their potential implications for planetary science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>A major observing campaign will continue as 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion. Following this event, the comet will go behind the Sun in late October, becoming temporarily invisible to Earth-based observers. It is expected to reappear by mid-November, allowing scientists to study its behavior and composition post-perihelion.</p>
