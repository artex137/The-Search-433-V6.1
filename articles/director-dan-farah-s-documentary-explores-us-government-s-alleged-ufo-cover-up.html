      <h2>Director Dan Farah’s Documentary Explores US Government’s Alleged UFO Cover-Up</h2>

<p>Director Dan Farah has released his documentary, "The Age of Disclosure," which investigates claims of a U.S. government cover-up regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). The film features testimonies from former officials and experts, highlighting concerns about national security and transparency.</p>

<p>The documentary is significant as it sheds light on the ongoing debate about UAPs and the government's role in concealing information. According to Farah, the film aims to challenge the stigma surrounding UAPs and push for greater openness from authorities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: "The Age of Disclosure"</li>
    <li>Director: Dan Farah</li>
    <li>Key figure: Luis Elizondo, former Pentagon official</li>
    <li>Production time: Three years</li>
    <li>Number of interviewees: 34 individuals, including members of Congress</li>
    <li>Key contributor: Jay Stratton, AATIP investigator</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Farah's interest in extraterrestrial life began in the 1980s and 1990s, influenced by films and television shows. He spent three years producing "The Age of Disclosure," focusing on interviews with credible witnesses from government programs.</p>
<p>The documentary features strong statements from Luis Elizondo, who has expressed that the government is withholding crucial information. The film also includes claims from Jay Stratton about witnessing “non-human craft and non-human beings.”</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The government has been withholding vital information from the public,” said Luis Elizondo.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If such intelligence is not disclosed, it could leave the nation vulnerable in international relations,” stated Marco Rubio.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary references historical events, such as the 1947 Roswell incident, to illustrate a long-standing cycle of secrecy surrounding UAPs. Farah argues that the U.S. government’s management of public perception about extraterrestrial phenomena began in a climate of post-war fear.</p>
<p>The film showcases a range of voices advocating for transparency, emphasizing the importance of credible testimonies over visual evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Farah hopes that as more insiders come forward, there will be a cultural shift towards transparency regarding UAPs. He believes it is imminent that a sitting U.S. president will acknowledge the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth.</p>
