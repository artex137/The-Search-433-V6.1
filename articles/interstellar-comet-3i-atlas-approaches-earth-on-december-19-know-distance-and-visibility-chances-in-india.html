      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth On December 19</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar comet, named 3I/ATLAS, is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, this comet is only the third confirmed object from beyond our solar system. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS provides a unique scientific opportunity for astronomers. While social media has circulated alarmist claims, scientists have confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth. Space agencies, including the European Space Agency, have stated that the flyby will be completely safe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass at approximately 1.8 astronomical units from Earth.</li>
    <li>This distance is roughly 168–170 million miles or around 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of nearly 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by NASA-funded ATLAS telescopes in Chile.</li>
    <li>The closest approach will occur on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will not be visible to the naked eye from India.</li>
    <li>A free livestream of the approach will be available starting at 11 pm EST on December 18 (9:30 am IST on December 19).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS telescopes. Scientists quickly confirmed its interstellar nature by analysing its speed and trajectory. As December 19 approaches, astronomers are preparing to observe the comet as it makes its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet will reach its closest point, approximately 1.8 astronomical units away from Earth, and continue its journey out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The flyby is completely safe, with no risk of collision or gravitational impact,” said a representative from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant because it is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its older and potentially larger composition makes it particularly valuable for research, offering insights into the formation of matter around other stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, scientists will study the material released from its icy nucleus. This data will enhance our understanding of the building blocks of distant planetary systems. After December 19, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey into interstellar space.</p>
