      <h2>We might finally know whether interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was an 'alien spacecraft'</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered in July 2022, has not exhibited signs of artificial technology during a recent radio signal scan. This scan took place on December 18, 2022, when the comet was approximately 170 million miles from Earth.</p>

<p>The findings are significant as they address ongoing speculation about the comet's origins and whether it could be a probe from an alien civilization. The research team from Oxford's Breakthrough Project used the Green Bank Telescope to search for radio signals that might indicate technology on or within the comet. The results have reignited discussions among experts about the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2022.</li>
    <li>The radio scan took place on December 18, 2022.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 170 million miles from Earth during the scan.</li>
    <li>The research was conducted by a team from Oxford's Breakthrough Project.</li>
    <li>No artificial technosignatures were detected during the scan.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, previously known as A11pI3Z, passed through the solar system in December 2022. Following its close approach, it is expected to make a stop at Jupiter in spring 2023 before continuing its journey into interstellar space.</p>

<p>On December 18, 2022, researchers from the Breakthrough Project conducted a scan of the comet using the Green Bank Telescope, looking for potential signals of alien technology. The results indicated that the comet displayed typical cometary characteristics, including a coma and an unelongated nucleus.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS exhibits mostly typical cometary characteristics,” the research team concluded in their paper published in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,” said Mark Christopher Lee, a UFO expert who supports the notion that advanced extraterrestrial intelligence might use different communication methods.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Alfredo Carpineti, a space correspondent for IFLScience, stated, “The ‘alien hypothesis’ was never backed up by any data… it is great to get telescopes to show, time and time again, that this interstellar interloper has nothing artificial going on.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The search for extraterrestrial life has intensified with the discovery of interstellar objects, with only three such objects observed to date. The comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn particular interest due to its unusual characteristics and the ongoing debate about the possibility of alien technology.</p>

<p>Previous incidents, such as the "Wow! signal" detected in 1977, have also fueled speculation about alien communications. The anomaly was a 72-second radio burst that has never been explained, leading to ongoing interest in signals from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further studies of 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects are anticipated as researchers seek to understand their origins and characteristics better. The scientific community continues to call for more observations to confirm the absence of artificial technology in these celestial bodies.</p>
