      <h2>Putin asked about existence of aliens: ‘This is secret information’</h2>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed questions about the existence of aliens during his annual televised news conference on December 19, 2023. During the event, he was asked about the 3I/ATLAS comet and its potential links to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This inquiry highlights ongoing public interest in unidentified phenomena and space exploration. The 3I/ATLAS comet is significant as it is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system, with its closest approach to Earth occurring today.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of news conference: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Comet's closest approach: 167 million miles (269 million km) from Earth</li>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Event type: Annual televised news conference</li>
    <li>Acting NASA administrator: Sean Duffy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2023, during a news conference, President Putin was asked by a reporter about the 3I/ATLAS comet. He responded with a light-hearted comment about the comet being a “secret weapon” of Russia, which elicited laughter from the audience. This comet is known for being the third interstellar comet to traverse the solar system.</p>

<p>Acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy has stated that there is “no threat to life” associated with the comet, dismissing any speculation about extraterrestrial life linked to it.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What I am about to tell you remains strictly between us,” Putin said, before joking about the comet being Russia’s “secret weapon.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“No aliens, no threat to life,” said Sean Duffy, the acting NASA administrator.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in the 3I/ATLAS comet and its connection to extraterrestrial life reflects a broader trend in society regarding space exploration and unidentified aerial phenomena. The previous interstellar comets have sparked similar discussions, often blending scientific inquiry with popular speculation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<pAuthorities and researchers will continue to monitor the 3I/ATLAS comet as it passes through the solar system, ensuring public safety and furthering the study of interstellar objects.</p>
