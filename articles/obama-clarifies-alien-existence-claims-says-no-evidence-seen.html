      <h2>Obama Clarifies Alien Existence Claims, Says No Evidence Seen</h2>

<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama has clarified his recent comments about the existence of aliens during a podcast appearance on February 14, 2026, stating that he has not seen evidence of extraterrestrial life. Obama made his initial remarks on the podcast hosted by U.S. YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen, where he said, “Aliens exist, but they are not at ‘Area 51.’” Following a widespread reaction, he took to social media on February 15 to further explain his position.</p>

<p>Obama's comments have sparked global interest and debate about the possibility of alien life and government transparency. He emphasized the vastness of the universe and the low probability of aliens visiting Earth, stating that during his presidency, he found no evidence of contact with extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of podcast: February 14, 2026</li>
    <li>Date of clarification: February 15, 2026</li>
    <li>Location of Area 51: Approximately 128 km northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada</li>
    <li>Area 51 established: 1955</li>
    <li>Related agency: U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2026, Obama appeared on the podcast of Brian Tyler Cohen and acknowledged the existence of aliens, stating they are not located at Area 51. The comments quickly became a topic of discussion worldwide.</p>
<p>The following day, on February 15, Obama used social media to clarify his statements, explaining the statistical likelihood of extraterrestrial life and asserting that he never encountered evidence of aliens during his presidency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Since it’s become a topic, let me be clear. The universe is vast, so statistically, there is a high probability of life out there. However, the gaps between solar systems are so vast that the likelihood of aliens visiting us is also very low.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“During my presidency, I never saw any evidence that we had contact with aliens. I’m serious!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The concept of Area 51 has long been associated with conspiracy theories about government secrecy and alien encounters. In 1989, a physicist claimed to have worked at the base, alleging he dismantled UFOs and learned about alien influence on Earth. This claim fueled distrust towards the U.S. government.</p>
<p>In 2013, the CIA disclosed details about Area 51, revealing its original purpose as a landing site for U-2 reconnaissance aircraft during the Cold War. The base has since become a cultural symbol in video games and films.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are no current investigations or charges related to Obama's comments. The discussion around aliens and government transparency is expected to continue in public discourse.</p>
