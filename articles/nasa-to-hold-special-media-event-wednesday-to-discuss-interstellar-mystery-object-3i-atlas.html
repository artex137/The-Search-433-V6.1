      <h2>NASA to Hold Special Media Event Wednesday to Discuss Interstellar Mystery Object 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>NASA has announced a media event scheduled for Wednesday, November 19, 2025, at 3 p.m. ET to discuss the interstellar object 3I/Atlas. The event will take place at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the event or the object.</p>

<p>This media event aims to clarify the nature of 3I/Atlas, which some scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, speculate could be an alien spacecraft. NASA plans to release new images and answer questions to help the scientific community better understand this unusual object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: November 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Event time: 3 p.m. ET</li>
    <li>Location: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li>Object speed: 140,000 mph relative to the Sun</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at discovery: 325 million miles</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Live streaming on NASA+, NASA app, NASA’s website, YouTube channel, and Amazon Prime</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Initial observations indicated that the object might have a highly eccentric orbit, prompting its listing on the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page by the International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center. Since its discovery, scientists have noted unusual behaviors, including a speed increase after passing close to the Sun and a lack of typical comet emissions.</p>

<p>On November 9, 2025, Avi Loeb published insights on the object's unusual jets, which extend significantly towards and away from the Sun, raising questions about its nature. As 3I/Atlas approaches Earth, it is expected to reach its closest point on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Assets within NASA’s science missions give the United States the unique capability to observe 3I/ATLAS almost the entire time it passes through our celestial neighborhood.” 
    — NASA spokesperson
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Given the large-scale jets reported recently, the fact that 3I/ATLAS remains a single body is surprising for a natural comet.” 
    — Avi Loeb, Harvard University astrophysicist
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System, following 2I/Borisov and 1I/'Oumuamua. This object has displayed behaviors that challenge conventional understandings of cometary dynamics, prompting renewed interest in its origins and characteristics.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has been a prominent voice in the discussion surrounding 3I/Atlas, suggesting that its behavior may indicate it is a manufactured object rather than a natural comet. His theories have garnered significant attention within the scientific community and beyond.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will unveil new imagery and data during the media event on November 19, 2025, to further investigate the nature of 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth. Scientists, including Loeb, continue to analyze the object’s behavior as it nears its closest point on December 19, 2025.</p>
