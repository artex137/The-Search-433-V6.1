      <h2>US Congress Video Shows Missile Failing To Damage Mysterious UFO Off Yemen</h2>

<p>A video presented during a US congressional hearing has shown a US Hellfire missile striking an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen on 30 October 2024, reportedly without effect. The footage, released on 9 September 2024 by Republican Representative Eric Burlison, was captured by an MQ-9 Reaper drone.</p>

<p>This incident has reignited discussions on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), as authorities continue to investigate similar occurrences. The Pentagon has not authenticated the video, and questions remain regarding the potential threat posed by the unidentified object to vessels in the region.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: 30 October 2024</li>
    <li>Video released: 9 September 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen, Red Sea</li>
    <li>Agency involved: US Department of Defense</li>
    <li>Type of missile: US Hellfire missile</li>
    <li>Drone used: MQ-9 Reaper</li>
    <li>Reported number of UAP cases reviewed by the Pentagon's AARO: over 700</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 30 October 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone captured footage of a fast-moving object off the coast of Yemen. The video shows a Hellfire missile striking the object, which appeared to continue unharmed along its path. The video was presented at a House Government Oversight subcommittee session on 9 September 2024.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Representative Eric Burlison displayed the video and discussed its implications. Investigative journalist George Knapp, who was testifying, commented on the missile's apparent ineffectiveness. The Pentagon has since declined to authenticate the footage.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is when it’s zoomed out, you can still see it traveling,” Representative Eric Burlison said regarding the footage.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “That’s the Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just (bouncing) right off. And it kept going,” George Knapp stated during the hearing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    A Pentagon defence official told ABC News, “We do not have anything to provide on this,” while a DOD spokesperson added, “I have nothing for you.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Red Sea was noted as an active conflict zone at the time of the incident, with US naval forces engaged in intercepting threats from Houthi-fired missiles and drones. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) continues to review over 700 new reports of UAP, many of which have been attributed to balloons, drones, or sensor errors, while some cases remain unresolved.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the unidentified object and the circumstances surrounding the missile strike are ongoing. The Pentagon's AARO is expected to continue its review of UAP incidents as more information becomes available.</p>
