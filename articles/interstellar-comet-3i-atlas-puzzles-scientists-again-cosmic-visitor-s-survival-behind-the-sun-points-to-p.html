      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS puzzles scientists again: Cosmic visitor's survival behind the Sun points to possible alien origin</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has raised new questions among scientists following its recent fly-by of the Sun. Discovered in July 2025, the comet has maintained its structural integrity, according to photos taken on November 11 by the Nordic Optical Telescope in Spain, despite expectations of disintegration during its perihelion passage.</p>

<p>This development has reignited debates about the comet's origin and nature. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet may be artificial, while other experts remain skeptical. Astronomers continue to study the comet to understand its unusual characteristics and the implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Recent photos taken on November 11 show the comet did not disintegrate during its perihelion, as previously expected.</li>
    <li>The comet's jets extend up to 1 million kilometers towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims the mass loss rate is too high for the comet to be a natural object.</li>
    <li>Michigan State University professor Darryl Seligman disagrees, stating the comet's behavior aligns with natural cometary activity.</li>
    <li>The MeerKAT radio telescope detected its first radio signal from 3I/ATLAS on October 24.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered, sparking interest among astronomers and space enthusiasts.</p>
<p>October 24, 2023: The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detects radio absorption lines from 3I/ATLAS, suggesting cometary activity.</p>
<p>November 11, 2023: Photos from the Nordic Optical Telescope reveal that 3I/ATLAS has not broken apart during its close approach to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The surface area required to account for the mass flow in the large-scale jets... is untenable," suggesting the object may be larger than previously thought.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Darryl Seligman commented, "The fact that 3I/ATLAS did not disintegrate is exactly in-line with what I expected to happen," based on the comet's size.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS has grown since its discovery, particularly regarding its potential origins. The debate between the natural versus artificial theories reflects broader discussions in the scientific community about interstellar visitors and their implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze data from telescopes. Future observations may provide more insights into its characteristics and origins.</p>
