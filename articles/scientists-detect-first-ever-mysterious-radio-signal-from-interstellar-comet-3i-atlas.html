      <h2>Scientists detect first ever mysterious radio signal from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>For the first time since its discovery in June, scientists have detected a strange radio signal from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves through our solar system. The signal was captured by South Africa’s MeerKAT radio telescope on October 24, after previous attempts on September 20 and 28 failed to yield results.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it provides new insights into the comet's composition and behavior. The absorption lines detected are from hydroxyl (OH) molecules, which consist of hydrogen and oxygen. The comet passed through the Earth's orbital plane just days prior, facilitating the detection of its unique radio signature. Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has expressed concerns about the comet's anomalies, suggesting it differs from typical natural comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in June 2023.</li>
    <li>Radio signal detected on October 24, 2023.</li>
    <li>Previous detection attempts occurred on September 20 and September 28.</li>
    <li>Signal detected using South Africa’s MeerKAT radio telescope.</li>
    <li>Latest images from November 9 show jets extending nearly 600,000 miles toward the Sun and 1.8 million miles away.</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb estimates the comet's size to be at least six miles or larger.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>June 2023: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered.</p>
<p>September 20 and 28, 2023: Astronomers attempt to detect a radio signal from the comet but are unsuccessful.</p>
<p>October 24, 2023: South Africa’s MeerKAT radio telescope successfully detects a radio signal from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The numbers are challenging a natural comet explanation,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, highlighting several anomalies that differentiate 3I/ATLAS from typical comets.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this detection, the comet's behavior raised questions among scientists. The rapid perihelion brightening and significant mass loss observed suggested it might not conform to known cometary models. The recent findings may prompt further investigation into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it progresses through the solar system, analyzing its emissions and behavior for further insights into its composition and characteristics.</p>
