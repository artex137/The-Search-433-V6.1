      <h2>Scientist Watching to See If Mysterious Object Visiting Our Solar System Releases Any Probes</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has raised the possibility that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, first spotted entering our solar system this year, could be an "extraterrestrial artifact." Observations from the Gemini South telescope in Chile have confirmed that the comet's tail is lengthening as it approaches the Sun, releasing dust and gas. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>This research is significant as 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to the Sun next month. Loeb has called on NASA to utilize its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Juno probe to monitor the object during its pass, which presents a unique opportunity for observation. He emphasized the need to remain vigilant regarding the possibility of the object releasing mini-probes that could arrive on Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Type: Comet</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: Next month</li>
    <li>Estimated size: Up to 28.5 miles across</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars' orbit: 1.67 million miles</li>
    <li>Observational tools suggested: NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Juno probe</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified entering the solar system earlier this year. Recent observations from the Gemini South telescope have indicated the comet's tail is growing as it nears the Sun. Loeb has advocated for monitoring the object closely as it approaches.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If we are visited by a technological object like 3I/ATLAS — it could either visit us or release some mini-probes that arrive to Earth and appear as unidentified aerial phenomena,” Loeb said on "The Sol Foundation" podcast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“And we just need to keep our eyes on the ball,” he added in a separate NewsNation interview.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is an object, if that is the size of it, that is a million times more massive than the previous interstellar objects we’ve seen, and that’s quite unlikely,” Loeb remarked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“But it may well be just a rock which has some ice on the surface that evaporates, in which case we will say it’s natural,” he stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, interstellar objects have been observed entering our solar system, but none have been as large or as close to several planets as 3I/ATLAS. Loeb's insistence on considering the possibility of extraterrestrial origins reflects a broader debate within the scientific community regarding the nature of unidentified phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun next month. NASA's response to Loeb's call for observation with its space probes remains to be seen.</p>
