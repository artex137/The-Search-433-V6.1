      <h2>US Rep Calls on NASA to Share Unreleased Pics of 3I/ATLAS as Comet Color Shifts for Third Time</h2>

<p>Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has called on NASA to release previously unreleased data and images of the comet 3I/ATLAS, which recently exhibited a color shift while passing near the sun. Luna, representing Florida, addressed her request to acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy in a letter shared on social media.</p>

<p>The request comes amid growing interest in 3I/ATLAS, which has shown signs of non-gravitational acceleration and appeared “bluer than the sun.” Luna emphasized the importance of this data for understanding interstellar visitors and their interactions with our solar system. She specifically requested images captured by the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter during its observations of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed within approximately 30 million kilometers (18.6 million miles) of Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Luna's letter was addressed to acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy.</li>
    <li>HiRISE images were captured between October 2-3, 2025.</li>
    <li>This is the third interstellar object recorded in our solar system.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, has speculated about the comet's unusual characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2-3, 2025, the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed near the sun. Following this event, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna sent a letter to NASA requesting the release of these images and additional data. The request has garnered attention from various public figures, including Kim Kardashian, who also inquired about the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I write to request the release of specific observational data related to 3I/ATLAS, recently captured by NASA missions,” Luna stated in her letter. “This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We all owe a debt of deep gratitude for the visionary support displayed by Representative Luna to frontier science through her letter,” Loeb wrote in a recent post.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “@NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” Duffy responded to Kardashian’s inquiry.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have sparked similar discussions about the nature of these cosmic visitors. The ongoing interest in 3I/ATLAS has led to calls for increased observation and research into its characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has not yet responded to Luna's request. The agency may consider additional observations of 3I/ATLAS, particularly through the Juno mission near Jupiter, as Luna suggested in her letter.</p>
