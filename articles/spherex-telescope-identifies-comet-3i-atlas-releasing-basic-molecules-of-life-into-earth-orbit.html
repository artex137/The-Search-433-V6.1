      <h2>SPHEREx telescope identifies comet 3I/ATLAS releasing basic molecules of life into Earth orbit</h2>

<p>American scientists, using data from the SPHEREx telescope, have confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS released a vast amount of organic compounds crucial to the formation of life. This revelation was made in early 2026, detailing the comet's passage close to Earth at the end of 2025, marking an event of astrobiological significance.</p>

<p>The discovery is important as it suggests that the building blocks of life may be widespread in the universe. Researchers from NASA and other institutions are now analyzing the implications of this finding for our understanding of life's origins and the chemical diversity present in other regions of the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet reached speeds of approximately 221,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Organic compounds identified include methanol, hydrogen cyanide, methane, ammonia, and water.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibited explosive material release in December 2025.</li>
    <li>The SPHEREx telescope analyzed the spectrum of light emitted by the comet's ejected materials.</li>
    <li>Carey Lisse, a researcher from Johns Hopkins University, led the study on this discovery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025. As it approached the Sun, the comet displayed unusual behavior characterized by an explosive release of materials. This event occurred in December 2025, leading to the identification of various organic compounds. In early 2026, scientists confirmed the significance of these findings, emphasizing the implications for astrobiology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The emission from newly exposed material was exceptionally rich in carbon, an element central to organic chemistry,” said Carey Lisse, the study's lead author.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The abundant release of organic compounds by an interstellar comet reinforces the idea that the ‘building blocks’ of life are a common feature throughout the universe,” Lisse added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of organic compounds in comet 3I/ATLAS supports the theory that comets may have played a role in seeding young planets with essential ingredients for life. Past research has indicated that impactful events in Earth's history contributed to the formation of a chemically rich environment conducive to the emergence of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future research will focus on analyzing the complexity of these organic molecules and investigating their chirality, which could provide insights into whether their origin is biological or abiotic. Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently on a trajectory toward a close encounter with Jupiter, where additional observations are expected to yield more data on its composition and behavior.</p>
