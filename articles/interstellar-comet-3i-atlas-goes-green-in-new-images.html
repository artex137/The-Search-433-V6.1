      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Goes Green in New Images</h2>

<p>New images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS show it has developed a diffuse greenish coma as it travels through the solar system. This change has occurred since its earlier pass and has been captured by astronomers using advanced telescopes.</p>

<p>The green hue provides insight into the comet's chemistry, as various ices vaporize and fluoresce in sunlight. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are conducting a wide-spectrum program to study the comet's composition while it remains visible.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at approximately <strong>220,000 kilometers per hour</strong>.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The green color is attributed to fluorescing diatomic carbon (C2) at a wavelength near <strong>516 nm</strong>.</li>
    <li>Astronomers have used the Gemini North telescope in Hawai‘i and the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton space telescope for observations.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are utilizing multiple instruments, including the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed as it approaches the Sun. Early observations showed a redder appearance, indicating a coma dominated by dust and red-emitting species. As it nears perihelion, the comet's color has shifted to green due to increased emissions of C2.</p>
<p>In a coordinated effort, astronomers have captured high-resolution images and conducted nearly 20 hours of X-ray observations to understand gas production rates and the chemical composition of the coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a graceful demonstration of both the comet’s path on the sky and how its coma’s spectrum changed,” said a representative from NOIRLab.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is unique, as it is a frozen time capsule from another star system. Unlike local comets, its composition shows a carbon dioxide-to-water ratio that deviates from typical measurements. Preliminary analyses suggest the comet has distinct characteristics influenced by its native system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. They aim to gather more data to understand its composition better and how it differs from comets originating in our solar system.</p>
