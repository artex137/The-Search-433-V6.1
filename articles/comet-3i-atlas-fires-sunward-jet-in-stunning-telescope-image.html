      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Fires Sunward Jet in Stunning Telescope Image</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, has been observed ejecting ice and dust into space, with a notable jet directed toward the Sun. The comet is currently on a trajectory to be within 1.8 astronomical units of Earth on October 30, 2023.</p>

<p>This activity is significant as it provides insights into the behavior of comets as they approach the Sun. Authorities, including astronomers and astrophysicists, are closely monitoring the comet's activity, capturing stunning images that showcase its dynamic nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of jet notification:</strong> October 15, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Date of jet footage capture:</strong> August 2, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location of imaging:</strong> Teide Observatory, Tenerife, Canary Islands</li>
    <li><strong>Distance of comet from Earth at closest approach:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated length of the jet:</strong> 6,200 miles (10,000 km)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 2, 2023, footage of the jet from comet 3I/ATLAS was captured at the Teide Observatory. This was followed by a notification regarding the jet on October 15, 2023. The comet is expected to be at its closest point to Earth on October 30, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet’s activity is expected as it nears the Sun and heats unevenly,” said Miquel Serra-Ricart, an astrophysicist and chief science officer at Light Bridges. “This results in weaker areas on its surface releasing sublimated gases, forming sun-facing jets.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Cometary jets are a common phenomenon as comets approach the Sun, where uneven heating causes materials to be released. This behavior has been observed in other comets, such as C/2020 F3 NEOWISE, which displayed similar dynamics during its visibility in 2020.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its approach, astronomers will monitor its behavior and composition, with amateur astronomers anticipated to observe it using small telescopes before it fades from view.</p>
