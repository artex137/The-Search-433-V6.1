      <h2>Astronomers uncover a 12-billion-year-old interstellar comet--older than the Sun and still traveling through the galaxy</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, estimated to be more than <strong>12 billion years old</strong>, making it potentially the oldest comet ever recorded. The finding, led by Dr. Matthew Hopkins of the University of Oxford, highlights the comet's origins in the early Milky Way. The study was released through EurekAlert!</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the conditions that existed billions of years before the formation of the Solar System. Researchers are currently gathering data on 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to the Sun, expected on <strong>29 October 2025</strong>.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between <strong>7.6 and 14 billion years old</strong>.</li>
    <li>It was first detected on <strong>1 July 2025</strong> by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at approximately <strong>58 kilometres per second</strong> relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>It will reach its perihelion on <strong>29 October 2025</strong>, at about <strong>1.36 astronomical units</strong> from the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following &#699;Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency and NASA are studying the comet's gas emissions and trajectory through early 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on <strong>1 July 2025</strong> by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its interstellar origin. The comet has since been observed to develop a bright coma and tail as it approaches the Sun. It is expected to reach its closest approach on <strong>29 October 2025</strong>, before continuing on its path out of the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “With about 68 per cent confidence, 3I/ATLAS is between 7.6 and 14 billion years old,” said Dr. Matthew Hopkins. “This finding provides a statistical basis to say that 3I/ATLAS is very likely to be the oldest comet we have ever seen.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This is a unique opportunity to study material that predates the Solar System itself. Every data point we collect adds to our understanding of where we came from,” Dr. Hopkins added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the knowledge of interstellar objects, following the detection of &#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These objects have provided unique insights into the composition and formation of celestial bodies outside our Solar System. The study of 3I/ATLAS's composition, particularly its high CO<sub>2</sub>-to-H<sub>2</sub>O ratio, suggests it formed in an environment with low metallicity, consistent with the ancient stars of the Milky Way's thick disk.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers worldwide are racing to gather data on 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. The European Space Agency and NASA have allocated telescope time to study the comet's gas emissions and dust composition until early 2026. Researchers aim to refine models of planetary system formation based on this ancient interstellar visitor.</p>
