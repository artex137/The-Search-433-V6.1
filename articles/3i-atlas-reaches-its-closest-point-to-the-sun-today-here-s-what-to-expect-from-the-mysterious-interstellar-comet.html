      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-29 07:45 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/Atlas reaches perihelion today — here’s what to expect from the mysterious interstellar comet</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has reached its perihelion today at approximately 11:47 UTC, or 4:47 a.m. PT, passing about 1.36 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, situated between Earth and Mars. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This perihelion is significant as it marks the closest approach of 3I/Atlas to the Sun, prompting various space agencies to observe its behavior. NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no hazard to Earth, with its closest approach occurring at around 1.8 AU in December. Ground telescopes will not be able to observe the comet during perihelion due to its position behind the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion occurred at 11:47 UTC on October 29.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is approximately 1.36 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is about 1.8 AU on December 19.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at roughly 68 km/s.</li>
    <li>ESA’s ExoMars orbiter has already captured images of 3I/Atlas near Mars.</li>
    <li>The International Asteroid Warning Network is conducting a coordinated astrometry exercise from November 27 to January 27.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been closely monitored as it approaches the Sun. The comet's perihelion today marks a key observational milestone. Following perihelion, the comet will pass about 0.65 AU from Venus on November 3, before its closest approach to Earth in mid-December. It is expected to pass Jupiter in March 2026 as it exits the inner solar system.</p>

<p>Agencies have positioned spacecraft to observe the comet during its upcoming visibility window, as it will become observable again later in November, likely during pre-dawn hours for many locations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s small bodies lead scientist, addressing speculation about the comet's nature.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We shouldn’t assume anything, and we should assess the risk given the data that we have,” stated Avi Loeb from Harvard, framing the perihelion as an “acid test.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community has expressed interest in the unusual chemical composition of 3I/Atlas. Observations have shown strong neutral nickel emissions without corresponding iron lines, indicating a different pathway for its chemical activity. This has led to ongoing debates about the nature of the comet, with most researchers asserting that it remains a natural object.</p>

<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network's upcoming campaign will focus on refining comet tracking techniques while reinforcing that 3I/Atlas is not a threat, but still a valuable subject for research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following today’s perihelion, scientists will continue to observe 3I/Atlas as it becomes more visible. The upcoming observations will help researchers gather more data and refine their understanding of the comet's behavior as it moves further from the Sun.</p>
