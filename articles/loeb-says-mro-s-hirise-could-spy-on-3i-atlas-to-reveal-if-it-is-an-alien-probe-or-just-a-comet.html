      <h2>Loeb says MRO’s HiRISE could spy on 3I/ATLAS to reveal if it is an alien probe or just a comet</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has suggested that the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera could help determine the nature of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars in October 2023. Loeb has proposed that this method could clarify whether 3I/ATLAS is a comet or an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>This matter has raised significant interest in the scientific community. Authorities are considering the implications of 3I/ATLAS, which has shown unusual characteristics for a comet. Loeb has expressed concerns about the possibility of the object being hostile and has called for world leaders to prepare for potential alien encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>At that time, it will be approximately 29 million kilometres from Mars and could come as close as 2.7 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has speculated that a mini-probe may be trailing 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>If an orbit correction occurs in September, the distance could reduce to zero.</li>
    <li>NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) detected 3I/ATLAS in May 2023.</li>
    <li>The brightness of 3I/ATLAS increased five times within weeks, a phenomenon not typical of comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2023, NASA's TESS detected 3I/ATLAS, two months before its visibility increased. Over the following weeks, the object's brightness surged, prompting further investigation from astronomers.</p>
<p>On October 3, 2023, 3I/ATLAS will approach Mars, presenting an opportunity for observation with the HiRISE camera. If the object is indeed a precursor to alien technology, scientists hope to capture images of any materials it may deliver to Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, "If the HiRISE camera catches 3I/ATLAS delivering materials to Mars in October 2025, then the chances of the outer space visitor being a piece of alien technology will increase manifold."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have sparked debate among astronomers. Its trajectory, size, and light reflection differ significantly from typical comet behaviour. Loeb has emphasized the need for further study to understand the true nature of this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, scientists will monitor the object closely. The potential for an orbit correction in September may yield significant insights during its closest approach, and further observations will determine the object's nature and implications for future exploration.</p>
