      <h2>3I/ATLAS is Captured in New Images as Mysterious Object Cruises Past Mars</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is making its closest approach to Mars today, October 3, 2025, with several spacecraft around the planet capturing what may be some of the clearest images of the unusual comet. The European Space Agency (ESA) has reported that its Mars orbiters have begun observing the comet as it passes, despite 3I/ATLAS being on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers as it provides a rare opportunity to study 3I/ATLAS up close. The ESA has indicated that new imagery may soon reveal important details about the comet's characteristics, which have puzzled scientists since its discovery on July 1, 2025. Currently, images obtained by the ESA have not been released, but they are expected to be available shortly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is closest to Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest distance between 3I/ATLAS and Mars is approximately 30 million km.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter are observing the comet.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is also capturing images of the comet.</li>
    <li>Perseverance rover has provided raw imagery from Jezero crater on October 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>New images from ESA and NASA are expected soon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first spotted the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. As it approaches Mars, ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter have been monitoring the comet since October 1, 2025. NASA's Perseverance rover also started capturing images on October 1, 2025, with observations continuing as the comet nears Mars.</p>

<p>On October 2, 2025, astrophotographer Simeon Schmauß reported a potential sighting of 3I/ATLAS in images taken by the Perseverance rover. He noted a faint smudge of light in the constellation Corona Borealis, close to the expected location of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Between 1 and 7 October, our Mars orbiters Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will observe the comet as it passes close to Mars," the ESA stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I think Perseverance may have spotted interstellar comet 3I/Atlas last night from Mars!” said Schmauß in a post.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of several interstellar objects that have drawn interest from the scientific community. Its unusual characteristics have left astronomers eager for more information, especially regarding its composition and potential origins. The ESA has indicated that additional observations will occur after the closest approach.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue capturing images of 3I/ATLAS in the coming days. The ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) is scheduled to observe the comet between November 2 and 25, 2025, which may provide further insights into its behavior and features.</p>
