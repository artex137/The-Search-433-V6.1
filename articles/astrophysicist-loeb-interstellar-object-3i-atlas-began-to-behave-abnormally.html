      <h2>Astrophysicist Loeb: Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS began to behave "abnormally"</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has undergone significant changes in behavior, according to Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist from Harvard University. The object, which was first spotted on July 1, has exhibited an "anomalous evolution," including a change in color from red to green, as reported by scientists at the Paranal Observatory in Chile.</p>

<p>This development raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential origins. Authorities at the European Southern Observatory have noted a sharp increase in the release of cyanide and nickel from the object, prompting further investigation into its characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object designation: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First spotted: July 1</li>
    <li>Color change: From red to green</li>
    <li>Diameter of coma: Approximately 24 kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated age: Over 7.5 billion years</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Paranal Observatory, Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The following key events have occurred regarding the 3I/ATLAS interstellar object:</p>
<ul>
    <li>July 1: 3I/ATLAS is first observed.</li>
    <li>End of August: Scientists report a sharp increase in cyanide and nickel release, leading to a color change.</li>
    <li>August: Avi Loeb suggests that the object emits its own light, similar to car headlights.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The 3I/ATLAS emits its own light, similar to the glow of a car's headlights, while the source of the glow is not installed.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS is believed to be one of the oldest comets observed, estimated to be three billion years older than the Sun. Its unique characteristics prompt scientists to explore the possibility that it could be an artificial object with a powerful energy source.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists at the European Southern Observatory continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for further changes and to better understand its origins and composition.</p>
