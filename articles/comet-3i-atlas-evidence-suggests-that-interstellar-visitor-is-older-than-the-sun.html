      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Evidence suggests that interstellar visitor is older than the sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed through the solar system, prompting researchers to suggest that it could be as old as 14 billion years, potentially dating back to the earliest days of the universe. The comet's recent journey has generated significant scientific interest, as it offers insights into the initial stages of star formation.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study material from the earliest phases of cosmic history. Researchers are currently analyzing the comet's trajectory and velocity to understand its origins and implications for our knowledge of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be 14 billion years old.</li>
    <li>The comet's hyperbolic path indicates it is not bound to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Researchers have analyzed its velocity and trajectory in relation to the Sun and other stars in the Milky Way.</li>
    <li>The study of the comet may refine models of stars and solid bodies in interstellar space.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS entered the solar system at a velocity that cannot be solely attributed to the Sun’s gravity. Its sharply inclined hyperbolic path has been observed, confirming that it will not return to the solar system.</p>

<p>Researchers have conducted further studies to analyze the comet's characteristics, suggesting that it originated from a primitive stellar population formed early in the universe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The study of 3I/ATLAS offers scientists an intriguing and rare opportunity to scrutinize material from the earliest phases of cosmic history,” researchers stated. “Current observations remain consistent with known astrophysical processes.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of interstellar objects have provided insights into the composition and dynamics of cosmic materials. Comet 3I/ATLAS adds to this body of knowledge, potentially enhancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from Comet 3I/ATLAS to refine models related to star formation and interstellar materials.</p>
