      <h2>Signs of collapse of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS are detected as it approaches the Sun at 210 million km</h2>

<p>Signs of collapse have been detected in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, currently located about 210 million kilometres away. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant for astronomers, who are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and structural integrity. Observations indicate that the comet may not survive its close encounter with the Sun, prompting researchers to gather data on its composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 210 million km from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It is an interstellar comet, first detected in 2019.</li>
    <li>Scientists have observed signs of structural collapse.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach perihelion (closest approach) in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li>Observations are being conducted by multiple astronomical agencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2019, marking it as an interstellar object. As it journeys through the solar system, astronomers have been tracking its path and changes in its structure. Recent observations have revealed signs indicating that the comet may be breaking apart as it nears the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The structural integrity of 3I/ATLAS is a concern as we approach perihelion. We are gathering as much data as possible to understand its behaviour,” said a spokesperson from the observing agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, and 3I/ATLAS is one of the first to be observed in detail. Previous studies of other comets have shown that close encounters with the Sun can lead to disintegration, making this observation critical for understanding such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, aiming to gather data on its final stages. Further observations will be conducted to assess the extent of the collapse and its implications for the study of interstellar objects.</p>
