      <h2>Rare Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Makes Closest Pass by Earth</h2>

<p>A comet from beyond our solar system, known as interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, is making its closest approach to Earth at 1:00 a.m. ET on December 19, 2025. This event marks a significant moment for astronomers, as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor detected in the solar system.</p>

<p>The rarity of this occurrence has drawn attention from both professional astronomers and backyard observers. Authorities, including NASA, have been tracking the comet's trajectory and composition as it approaches Earth. Observatories worldwide are providing updates and resources for those looking to observe this unique celestial event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 1:00 a.m. ET (6:00 a.m. GMT)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Approximately 1.8 astronomical units (168 million miles or 270 million kilometers) from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Constellation Leo, near Regulus</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> By the ATLAS survey system, a NASA-funded project</li>
    <li><strong>Viewing Conditions:</strong> Best seen with a telescope; may appear as a faint smudge</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream Coverage:</strong> Scheduled for December 18, 2025, at 11:00 p.m. ET</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey system, which is designed to detect moving objects in the sky. Early measurements indicated that it was traveling too quickly and on a trajectory too extreme to be part of the solar system. Since its discovery, observatories have monitored the comet closely in anticipation of its close approach to Earth.</p>
<p>As December 19 approaches, astronomers are advising the public on the best times and methods to observe the comet. The comet is expected to gradually fade after its closest approach, making this week’s pass particularly significant for observers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects offer a rare chance to study material formed in a different planetary system,” NASA noted in a statement.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are extremely rare, with 3I/ATLAS being only the third confirmed instance. Previous interstellar visitors have provided scientists with valuable insights into the composition of materials from outside our solar system. Comets, composed of frozen gases, rock, and dust, can reveal information about their origins as they release gas and dust while approaching the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After the closest approach, 3I/ATLAS will continue on its trajectory back into interstellar space. Observers are encouraged to utilize telescopes or attend local astronomy club events for the best viewing experience. The comet is expected to be observable for a limited time before it fades from view.</p>
