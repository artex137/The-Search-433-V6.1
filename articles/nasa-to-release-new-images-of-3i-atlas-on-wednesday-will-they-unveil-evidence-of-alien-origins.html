      <h2>NASA to release new images of comet 3I/ATLAS on Wednesday</h2>

<p>NASA will unveil new images of the Manhattan-sized comet 3I/ATLAS on Wednesday, November 19, at 3 p.m. EST at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The images will include high-resolution photos taken during various agency missions as the comet travels through the solar system.</p>

<p>This release is significant as scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, believe the images could provide insights into the comet's origins. Loeb has suggested that the photos might reveal evidence of artificial structures associated with the comet. NASA has announced that the event will be livestreamed on its YouTube channel, allowing viewers to participate remotely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date and time:</strong> November 19, 2025, at 3 p.m. EST</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Notable imagery:</strong> Includes photos from the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream:</strong> Available on NASA’s YouTube channel</li>
    <li><strong>Previous imaging:</strong> Hubble Space Telescope images taken on July 21, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's imaging of 3I/ATLAS has developed over several months. The HiRISE camera captured images of the comet during its pass by Mars from October 1 to October 7, 2025. The release of these images was delayed due to a government shutdown that ended late last Wednesday. Loeb has previously criticized NASA for the delay, suggesting that scientific data should take precedence over bureaucratic processes.</p>

<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA will officially unveil the images, which are expected to be the highest resolution photos of the comet to date.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Science should have been prioritized over bureaucracy. The truth about the nature of 3I/ATLAS will be revealed by the sharing of data, not by the storyline of gatekeepers.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also noted, “The images from the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter would give us a side-view of the anti-tail, as well as a spatial resolution that is 3 times better than that of the Hubble Space Telescope.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object recorded in our solar system. Previous observations have raised questions about its composition and origins. Loeb has speculated that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien probe, potentially equipped with technology for reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Past imaging efforts, including those from the Hubble Space Telescope, have provided some insights, but the upcoming HiRISE images are expected to reveal new details about the comet’s structure and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa is set to release the new images on November 19, 2025. The scientific community will analyze the data for insights into the comet's properties and potential implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>
