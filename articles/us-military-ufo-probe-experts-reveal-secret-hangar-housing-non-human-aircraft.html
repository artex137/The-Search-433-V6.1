      <h2>US Military UFO Probe: Experts Reveal Secret Hangar Housing 'Non-Human' Aircraft</h2>

<p>Speculation surrounding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) has resurfaced in the United States after claims emerged that a military facility may house aircraft of 'non-human' origin. These allegations center on Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, where sources have suggested a classified hangar has been storing such aircraft for decades.</p>

<p>This matter has drawn attention as it raises questions about government transparency regarding UFO investigations. Authorities have faced scrutiny over their denial of possessing physical evidence of extraterrestrial technology, despite claims from former intelligence officials and unnamed sources indicating otherwise.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland</li>
    <li>Years of alleged storage: possibly since the 1950s</li>
    <li>Reported incidents: at least two separate aircraft monitoring activity</li>
    <li>One identified aircraft: Chinese surveillance drones</li>
    <li>Claimed second set of incursions: unidentified flying objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Reports regarding the storage of 'non-human' aircraft began circulating after testimony from former Pentagon intelligence official Luis Elizondo, who stated that the US government has covert programmes focused on the recovery of such craft. Elizondo testified before Congress, emphasizing that specialized facilities exist for this purpose, including one at Patuxent River.</p>

<p>According to Elizondo, the hangar at Patuxent River was specifically designed for the transfer of materials. He also claimed that some recovered craft had been opened and were undergoing reverse engineering.</p>

<p>However, some anonymous sources have disputed Elizondo's statements, asserting that no new hangars have been constructed at the base following restrictions imposed by the former CIA director of science and technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These facilities included locations in the Las Vegas area and a newly built hangar at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station ('PAX'). Specifically, the PAX River hangar was designed to facilitate the transfer of future materials via air and river.”</blockquote>
<p>- Luis Elizondo, former Pentagon intelligence official</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding UFOs and government secrecy has a long history in the United States. Previous incidents have often involved anonymous sources making dramatic claims without tangible proof, leading to skepticism among the public. However, the testimony of former officials like Elizondo has fueled belief in the existence of hidden discoveries regarding extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into these claims may continue as authorities assess the validity of the allegations. The Pentagon has maintained its position that no physical evidence of UFOs has been recorded, but public interest in these claims is likely to persist.</p>
