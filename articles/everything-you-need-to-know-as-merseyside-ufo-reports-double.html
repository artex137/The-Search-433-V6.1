      <h2>Everything you need to know as Merseyside UFO reports double</h2>

<p>New data from a Freedom of Information request has revealed that reports of UFOs and aliens to Merseyside Police have doubled from 2024 to 2025, rising from 17 to 34 incidents. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to these sightings.</p>

<p>This increase in reports has sparked interest among local residents and enthusiasts, who believe Liverpool is becoming a significant hotspot for UFO sightings. Authorities are currently reviewing these reports to determine the nature of the incidents and any potential patterns.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>UFO reports in Merseyside rose from 17 in 2024 to 34 in 2025.</li>
    <li>Gideon Allen, an actor and self-described "part-time witch," reported seeing a flashing orb in the Baltic Triangle.</li>
    <li>Historical sightings in the region date back to 1967, including multiple accounts of unidentified flying objects.</li>
    <li>Notable past incidents feature "green flying saucers" and a "plate in the sky" reported by dozens of witnesses.</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1967, Merseyside experienced a notable "major flap" of UFO sightings, with several reports emerging from different areas, including Huyton and Whiston Lane. Witnesses described glowing objects and significant aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>In recent months, the number of UFO sightings has surged, prompting local authorities to investigate the claims. Gideon Allen's encounter in the Baltic Triangle, where he observed an orb moving erratically, is one of the latest reports contributing to the increase.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
