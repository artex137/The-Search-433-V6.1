      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard’s Avi Loeb Critiques NASA’s Latest Images of Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has criticized NASA’s recent release of images of interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, calling the visuals “fuzzy” and “deceptive” during a live stream on November 19, 2025. Loeb expressed disappointment over the lack of significant new data regarding the comet, which is only the third object identified as passing through the solar system from outside the galaxy.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it represents a coordinated effort by NASA’s fleet of spacecraft to observe 3I/ATLAS. Authorities aim to gather more information as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025. Loeb has raised questions about the scientific conclusions drawn from the images, suggesting that they may not adequately represent the comet’s characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA released images of 3I/ATLAS on November 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 30 million kilometers away from Earth.</li>
    <li>Loeb noted the images have a resolution of 30 kilometers per pixel.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA used eight different spacecraft, satellites, and telescopes for observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured an image of 3I/ATLAS. The live stream featuring the release of images took place on November 19, 2025. During this event, Loeb provided his analysis and commentary on the images presented.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I hoped to be surprised and I was not. We did see new data but nothing major as to the insight into the nature of the object.” — Avi Loeb</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When monitoring an interstellar visitor, we should not fall prey to traditional thinking but scrutinize new interpretations.” — Avi Loeb</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.” — Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, following <strong>1I/Oumuamua</strong> and <strong>2I/Borisov</strong>. Previous observations of such objects have spurred scientific interest and debate regarding their origins and characteristics. Loeb's critique highlights ongoing discussions in the astrophysics community regarding data interpretation and the significance of new observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming weeks, larger ground-based telescopes, as well as the Hubble and Webb telescopes, are expected to analyze 3I/ATLAS further. These observations will aim to measure the comet's jets, which may provide insights into whether they are produced by natural ice or technological thrusters. Results will be anticipated before the comet's closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>
