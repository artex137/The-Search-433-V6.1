      <h2>Harvard professor proposes plan to intercept 'Alien ship' with an incredible mission</h2>

<p>A Harvard professor has proposed a plan to intercept a peculiar interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, which is currently speeding towards Earth. Professor Avi Loeb has suggested that this object may have been dispatched by extraterrestrials to gauge human intelligence. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this plan.</p>

<p>This proposal is significant as it raises questions about potential extraterrestrial contact and the capabilities of advanced technology. While many experts have dismissed these ideas, Loeb advocates for a more thorough investigation of the object, which has been observed to be "generating its own light." The discussion follows comments from Sen. John Kennedy regarding unusual theories about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: 221,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Potential close approach to Mars: October 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars on October 3: 29 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Closest distance to Mars: 2.7 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Proposed Juno spacecraft maneuver date: September 14, 2025</li>
    <li>Projected rendezvous with 3I/ATLAS: March 14, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been identified as an interstellar object traveling through our solar system. Professor Loeb has proposed that the object could be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy based on its unique light emission. He has suggested using NASA's Juno spacecraft, which was launched in 2011, to attempt to intercept the object. This interception is planned for March 14, 2026, if Juno can accelerate on September 14, 2025. Additionally, 3I/ATLAS is expected to come close to Mars in October 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The close encounter of 3I/ATLAS to Jupiter provides a rare opportunity to shift Juno from its current orbit around Jupiter to intercept the path of 3I/ATLAS at its closest approach to Jupiter," said Professor Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The focused glow of 3I/ATLAS is akin to a vehicle turning on its headlights," Loeb noted, suggesting it could be a spacecraft.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This proposal follows ongoing debates in the scientific community regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS. While prevailing theories classify it as a comet, Loeb's research indicates that its light emissions differ from typical cometary behavior. The suggestion to use existing space missions, like Juno and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, highlights the potential for utilizing current technology in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the scientific community evaluates Loeb's claims, further investigations into 3I/ATLAS will take place. The Juno spacecraft's proposed maneuver and the approach of 3I/ATLAS to Mars will be closely monitored in the coming months.</p>
