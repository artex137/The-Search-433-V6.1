      <h2>3I/ATLAS exceeds expectations: it reaches 57 km/s and doubles the speed of other interstellar comets</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has astonished astronomers by reaching a speed of 57 kilometers per second (205,200 km/h) following its closest approach to the Sun on October 30. This speed is more than double that of the previously known interstellar object, Oumuamua, which was observed in 2017. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing notions of interstellar objects and their behavior. Observations from both the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope confirm that 3I/ATLAS is not bound by the gravity of the Solar System, allowing it to travel on a hyperbolic trajectory that will not bring it back to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Speed: 57 km/s (205,200 km/h)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2023</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Predicted visibility: Morning sky near constellations Virgo and Leo</li>
    <li>Significance: No danger to Earth; opportunity for observation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2023, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun, reaching a remarkable speed of 57 km/s. Following this, on November 24, researchers released a study exploring the hypothetical impact of an interstellar object similar to 3I/ATLAS on Earth. The study generated 26 billion synthetic trajectories to analyze potential collision scenarios.</p>

<p>The findings indicated that, if such an event were to occur, the object could impact Earth at speeds close to 72 km/s, significantly higher than typical meteoroids. However, the likelihood of a collision involving 3I/ATLAS has been ruled out.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behavior of 3I/ATLAS sets it apart from local comets, revealing the existence of interstellar visitors that may be more common than previously thought,” said an unnamed astronomer involved in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the interstellar objects Oumuamua and Borisov had opened discussions about the presence of such bodies in our Solar System. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS reinforces the idea that interstellar objects may frequently pass through our cosmic neighborhood, albeit often unnoticed due to their speed and faintness.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research will continue as new data on 3I/ATLAS becomes available. The comet's closest approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2025, which will provide an opportunity for amateur astronomers to observe and capture images of this high-speed interstellar traveler.</p>
