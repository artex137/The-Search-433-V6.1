      <h2>NASA HiRISE Photos of Comet 3I/ATLAS Spark Conspiracy Theories</h2>

<p>NASA's recent release of HiRISE photographs of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has fueled conspiracy theories, with critics alleging that the agency is hiding critical information. The images, unveiled after a government shutdown delayed updates, were unexpectedly blurry, raising questions about transparency and accuracy in the agency's reporting.</p>

<p>The release of these images matters because they were anticipated to provide significant insights into the comet's unique characteristics. Instead, the disappointment and confusion among the public have led to renewed speculation about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and NASA's intentions. The comet, discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS observatory in Chile, has intrigued scientists and the public alike due to its unusual trajectory and interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Discovery:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Image Release Date:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 246,000 kilometers per hour (153,000 miles per hour)</li>
    <li><strong>NASA Missions Involved:</strong> HiRISE, MAVEN, STEREO, SOHO, Psyche, and Lucy</li>
    <li><strong>NASA Official:</strong> Amit Kshatriya, Associate Administrator</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS observatory in Chile. Following its discovery, the comet drew global interest due to its unique characteristics. NASA's images, intended to provide clarity on the comet, were released after a government shutdown delayed updates. However, the images were blurry, leading to public disappointment and speculation.</p>
<p>NASA has since stated that the HiRISE camera, while powerful, was not designed to track fast-moving, faint objects such as 3I/ATLAS. The agency has emphasized the limitations of their imaging capabilities in this context.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet,”</blockquote> said Amit Kshatriya, NASA Associate Administrator, during a conference at Goddard Space Flight Centre.

<blockquote>“The image taken by the HiRISE camera shows a fuzzy ball of light,”</blockquote> stated Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, in a Medium essay. He criticized NASA's focus on optics rather than addressing the comet's unexplained characteristics.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The blurry images and NASA's limited explanations have reignited debates about transparency within the agency. Speculation around 3I/ATLAS has been amplified by the agency's historical handling of significant discoveries, leading to distrust among some members of the public.</p>
<p>Previous incidents involving NASA's communication strategies have often sparked similar theories, particularly regarding unexplained phenomena in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest pass to Earth on 19 December 2025, the debate surrounding its nature is expected to intensify. NASA maintains that the blurry images result from scientific limitations, while conspiracy theories continue to circulate online.</p>
