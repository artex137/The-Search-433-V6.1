      <h2>The story of a NH alien abduction is set to become a feature film</h2>

<p>A feature film based on the alleged alien abduction of Betty and Barney Hill from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, is in development. The film will draw from the podcast “Strange Arrivals,” hosted by Toby Ball, and will feature actors Demi Moore and Colman Domingo. The Hills claimed to have been abducted in 1961, a story that has captivated audiences for decades.</p>

<p>This film adaptation highlights the ongoing interest in UFO phenomena and the Hill case, which remains a significant part of New Hampshire's cultural history. Toby Ball will discuss the podcast and its transition to film this Thursday at Wiggin Memorial Library in Stratham.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Incident date:</strong> 1961</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Franconia Notch, New Hampshire</li>
    <li><strong>Key individuals:</strong> Betty and Barney Hill</li>
    <li><strong>Podcast host:</strong> Toby Ball</li>
    <li><strong>Film actors:</strong> Demi Moore, Colman Domingo</li>
    <li><strong>Discussion event:</strong> Thursday at Wiggin Memorial Library, Stratham</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1961, Betty and Barney Hill, an interracial couple from Portsmouth, claimed they experienced a UFO encounter while driving home from Montreal. They reported seeing a large object and noted a loss of time, arriving home later than expected.</p>

<p>Two and a half years later, the Hills underwent hypnosis with psychiatrist Doctor Benjamin Simon, during which they recalled being taken aboard a flying saucer and subjected to medical examinations. Their experience has since become a foundational narrative in alien abduction folklore.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Some people are familiar with the Hill story, but I just learned some Granite Staters don't know about this incident at all.” 
    — Toby Ball
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “I don't believe that they were actually abducted by aliens. But I think one of the reasons why this story has so much staying power is that there's not an easy answer to that question of what happened.” 
    — Toby Ball
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Betty and Barney Hill case is often considered the template for modern alien abduction narratives. The incident took place during a time of heightened interest in UFOs, following significant sightings in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Hills' experience reflects broader themes of technology, fear, and wonder that have persisted in UFO folklore.</p>

<p>Previous incidents in New Hampshire, such as The Exeter Incident in the 1960s, also contribute to the state's reputation as a hotspot for UFO sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The film adaptation of the podcast is expected to bring renewed attention to the Hills' story and UFO phenomena. Toby Ball's discussion at Wiggin Memorial Library will further explore the cultural significance of this case and its impact on public perceptions of alien encounters.</p>
