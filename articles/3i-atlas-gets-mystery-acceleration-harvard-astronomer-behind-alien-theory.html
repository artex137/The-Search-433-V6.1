      <h2>3I/ATLAS Gets Mystery Acceleration—Harvard Astronomer Behind Alien Theory</h2>

<p>A Harvard University professor has stated that comet 3I/ATLAS has experienced a sudden "nongravitational" acceleration while passing around the sun. Abraham "Avi" Loeb, a professor of science and director of the Institute for Theory and Computation, reported this discovery on Thursday night, asserting it could indicate that the comet is "alien technology." The comet was discovered on July 1 and has sparked debate among scientists regarding its nature.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it raises questions about the origins of 3I/ATLAS and its behavior as an interstellar object. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring the comet's trajectory and potential mass loss. NASA’s SPHEREx has been observing 3I/ATLAS from August 7 to August 15, and further observations are planned for November and December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims the comet accelerated at its closest point to the sun.</li>
    <li>Loeb calculated that the comet should have lost at least 10% of its mass to achieve this acceleration.</li>
    <li>Predicted observations of gas cloud around 3I/ATLAS will occur in November and December.</li>
    <li>NASA’s SPHEREx observed the comet from August 7 to August 15.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to be closest to Earth on December 19.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 3I/ATLAS was discovered, marking it as only the third interstellar comet identified. Following its discovery, it was observed by NASA’s SPHEREx from August 7 to August 15. On Thursday night, Avi Loeb calculated the comet's acceleration due to potential mass loss from outgassing. He projected that a dense cloud of gas should be observable around the comet in November and December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By the date of its perihelion, 3I/ATLAS displayed the first evidence of a nongravitational acceleration,” said Avi Loeb. “If 3I/ATLAS is propelled by the rocket effect of ejected gas, then momentum conservation implies that the object would lose half its mass over a characteristic timescale equal to the ejection speed divided by the measured nongravitational acceleration.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Darryl Seligman from Michigan State University stated, “Comets have nongravitational accelerations all the time... they are very subtle and difficult to measure.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of nongravitational acceleration is not new in the study of comets. The first interstellar object discovered, 1I/`Oumuamua, also exhibited this acceleration without a visible dust coma. Experts like Seligman emphasize that comets naturally lose material and that such accelerations can indicate outgassing or mass loss.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other scientific agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for signs of gas emissions in the coming months. Observations are expected to confirm or refute the claims made by Loeb regarding the comet's mass loss and potential technological signatures.</p>
