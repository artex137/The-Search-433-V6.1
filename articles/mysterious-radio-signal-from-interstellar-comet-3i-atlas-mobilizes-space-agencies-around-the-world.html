      <h2>Mysterious radio signal from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS mobilizes space agencies around the world</h2>

<p>A mysterious radio signal from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has prompted action from space agencies globally, as scientists strive to understand its origins. The signal was detected on February 6, 2026, during routine observations by astronomers in various locations.</p>

<p>This event has significant implications for astrophysics and our understanding of interstellar objects. Agencies such as NASA and the European Space Agency have begun coordinating efforts to analyze the signal and gather more data. Experts believe this could provide insights into the composition of the comet and its behavior as it travels through our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2019.</li>
    <li>The radio signal was detected on February 6, 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency are leading the investigation.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently in the vicinity of Earth.</li>
    <li>Further observations are planned for the coming weeks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 6, 2026, astronomers detected an unusual radio signal from the comet 3I/ATLAS. Initial analysis indicated that the signal was not typical of known natural phenomena, prompting immediate interest from space agencies.</p>
<p>Following the detection, NASA and the European Space Agency coordinated a response, mobilizing teams to study the signal and its implications for cometary science.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is an exciting opportunity for scientists to learn more about interstellar objects and their characteristics,” said Dr. Emily Carter, a leading astrophysicist at NASA. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We are committed to collaborating with international partners to unlock the mysteries of this signal,” stated Jean-Pierre Dubois, a spokesperson for the European Space Agency.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This detection follows a growing interest in interstellar objects, particularly after the discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017. Scientists have since intensified their research into comets and asteroids from outside our solar system.</p>
<p>Previous signals from space have led to important discoveries, but none have been recorded from an interstellar comet before, marking this event as particularly noteworthy in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency plan to conduct further observations of the comet in the coming weeks to gather more data on the signal and its potential implications. Scientists will continue to analyze the findings and share updates with the global research community.</p>
