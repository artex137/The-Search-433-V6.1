      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS on 14 November 2025: New ESA Orbit, Fresh Spectra, Politics, Alien Hype – and How to See It</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has made headlines again on 14 November 2025, with new orbital data from the European Space Agency (ESA), a detailed optical and infrared analysis, and ongoing political discussions regarding NASA's release of images. The comet is currently visible to Northern Hemisphere observers, although it remains a target for telescopes only.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. Authorities are actively monitoring 3I/ATLAS to refine its trajectory and gather more data on its composition and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Reported by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Traced back beyond the Oort Cloud, indicating it came from outside the Solar System.</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> Occurred around 30 October 2025, at approximately 1.4 AU (about 210 million km) from the Sun.</li>
    <li><strong>Closest to Earth:</strong> Will be about 1.8 AU (approximately 270 million km) on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Estimated to be up to 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across, potentially as small as a few hundred meters.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Racing through the Solar System at around 250,000 km/h (approximately 155,000 mph).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was first reported by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Pre-discovery images date back to 14 June 2025. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on 30 October 2025. On 3 October 2025, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS during its flyby of Mars, aiding in the refinement of its orbit.</p>
<p>On 14 November 2025, ESA released updated orbital data showing a tenfold improvement in the predicted path of 3I/ATLAS, thanks to measurements from the ExoMars spacecraft and Earth-based observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is the first time that precise astrometric measurements from a spacecraft orbiting another planet have been officially submitted to, and accepted by, the Minor Planet Center for orbit refinement.” – ESA statement
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the known interstellar objects were 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The current observations of 3I/ATLAS indicate unusual characteristics, including a high proportion of carbon dioxide and a dusty surface, possibly over 11 billion years old.</p>
<p>Political scrutiny has intensified as a recent 43-day U.S. government shutdown ended, restoring funding for NASA and other agencies. Some representatives are demanding the release of images and data related to 3I/ATLAS, highlighting the intersection of science and politics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to continue analyzing data from 3I/ATLAS and may release images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Ongoing observations will help refine the comet's trajectory and enhance understanding of its composition as it approaches its closest point to Earth in December 2025.</p>
