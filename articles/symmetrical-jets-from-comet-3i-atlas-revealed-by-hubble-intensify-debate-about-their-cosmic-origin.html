      <h2>Symmetrical jets from comet 3I/ATLAS revealed by Hubble intensify debate about their cosmic origin</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has recently made its closest approach to Earth, is generating significant interest and debate among scientists regarding its origins and characteristics. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have uncovered symmetrical jets emanating from the comet's core, adding complexity to its already mysterious profile.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it challenges existing theories about comet behavior. Scientists are now working to understand the mechanisms behind the observed phenomena, with various hypotheses being debated within the astronomical community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth recently.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted using the Hubble Space Telescope between November and December 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet features an antitail, which is an optical illusion caused by Earth crossing its orbital plane.</li>
    <li>Three symmetrical jets have been observed, a rare phenomenon in comet studies.</li>
    <li>The Breakthrough Listen project found no artificial radio transmissions from 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2023, classified as an interstellar object originating from outside our solar system. Following its detection, observatories worldwide began monitoring its trajectory and behavior. Between November and December 2023, Hubble captured images revealing the comet's symmetrical jets.</p>

<p>As the comet approached perihelion, scientists noted significant sublimation activity, characteristic of comets rich in volatile materials. The observations have sparked renewed discussions about the nature of the jets and the potential for a non-natural explanation, led by astronomer Avi Loeb.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb expressed skepticism about a purely natural explanation for the symmetry of the jets, suggesting it resembles a "lighthouse beam." He raised the possibility that 3I/ATLAS could be a technological remnant from an extraterrestrial civilization.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA specialists countered that the data collected aligns with known comet behavior, asserting that nature can produce a variety of phenomena.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is often compared to ‘Oumuamua, the first confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system in 2017. While ‘Oumuamua generated speculation about an artificial origin due to its shape and acceleration, 3I/ATLAS exhibits typical cometary features, making it less controversial in classification.</p>

<p>The rarity of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS provides valuable opportunities for scientists to study the chemical composition and formation of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The astronomical community will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it moves further from Earth. Researchers aim to collect spectrographic data to analyze its chemical composition and to model its rotational dynamics and jet activity. This ongoing study is crucial for understanding the unique characteristics of this cosmic visitor.</p>
