      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: Latest Location, Visibility, Live Stream, Date, How To Watch And Sky Map</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS is projected to make its closest approach to the sun, known as perihelion, on October 30, 2025, coming within approximately 210 million kilometres of the sun. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This event matters to astronomers and the public as it provides an opportunity to observe a celestial object shedding mass and releasing gases. The European Space Agency has noted that the comet will continuously lose material as it approaches the sun, creating a spectacle for skywatchers and scientists alike.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Perihelion of Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest distance to sun:</strong> 210 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Expected again around November 11, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope requirement:</strong> Minimum 20 cm in diameter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the lead-up to October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS has been shedding mass due to the transformation of frozen gases into vapour, which ejects dust and ice particles into space. This process has been ongoing as the comet approaches the sun.</p>
<p>Public interest has surged as various theories about the comet's nature have circulated, including claims from Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb regarding its potential as alien technology. However, Loeb has since stated that the comet is likely of natural origin.</p>
<p>Skywatchers can expect to see the comet re-emerge in the eastern sky before dawn around November 11, 2025, though viewing will require powerful telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated that while 3I/ATLAS is "most likely a comet of natural origin," he has not entirely dismissed the possibility of it being an artificial construct.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS has led to significant public fascination, with various conspiracy theories emerging about its origins. Previous celestial events have similarly sparked public interest, often leading to a blend of scientific inquiry and speculation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches perihelion, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and mass loss. Observations will be crucial for understanding its composition and behavior as it becomes visible again in November 2025.</p>
