      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Claims of Alien Technology Spark Debate Among Astronomers</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object detected, has generated significant discussion among scientists regarding its true nature, with some claiming it may be an alien spacecraft rather than a comet. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has presented multiple observations that challenge the conventional view of 3I/ATLAS as a natural space rock. He argues that the object’s characteristics suggest it could be a piece of advanced technology.</p>

<p>This debate is significant as it raises questions about the nature of interstellar objects and the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence. NASA and other scientific organizations continue to analyze data related to 3I/ATLAS to better understand its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has claimed a 0.2% chance that 3I/ATLAS is a natural space object.</li>
    <li>The object has a nucleus with a diameter of 46 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Loeb notes the lack of a typical comet tail or dust coma.</li>
    <li>Observations detected nickel without iron in the gas plume around 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>NASA's TESS captured images of 3I/ATLAS in May 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2023, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) captured images of 3I/ATLAS, showing a sudden brightness increase. Between May 7 and June 3, the object became five times brighter. This observation preceded its official detection, raising questions about its nature.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has since analyzed the data and made claims regarding the object’s trajectory and composition. He has argued that the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its retrograde orbit and lack of expected cometary features, suggest it may be an artificial construct.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The lack of a bright water gas coma is puzzling as 3I/ATLAS was not too far outside the Solar system’s 'water ice line' at 2.5 AU during the observations."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb added, "This is an extremely rare and exotic possibility in comets, whereas it is a standard technology for industrial nickel refining."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the detection of 2I/Borisov, the last interstellar visitor. Previous interstellar objects have been classified as comets, but 3I/ATLAS has sparked a new discussion regarding the characteristics and origins of such objects. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretation of its unusual features.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other scientific organizations are expected to continue analyzing data from 3I/ATLAS to determine its nature. Further observations and studies may provide more insight into whether the object is a natural space rock or something entirely different.</p>
