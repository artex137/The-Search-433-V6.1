      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Object Approaches Sun, Sparks Scientific Interest</h2>

<p>The 3I/ATLAS interstellar object is approaching the Sun, with its closest approach scheduled for October 30, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), it is classified as a comet by NASA and is estimated to be the size of Manhattan. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>Scientists and policymakers are urging NASA to closely monitor the object as questions arise regarding its origin, nature, and potential impact on Earth. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS present an opportunity to study material from outside the solar system, which could enhance understanding of planetary formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Passage near Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Observatories involved: Hubble, James Webb Space Telescope, SPHEREx, TESS</li>
    <li>Unique composition: Higher carbon dioxide to water ratio than previously studied comets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first discovered the 3I/ATLAS interstellar object. By August 27, 2025, images captured from the Gemini South telescope in Chile revealed a growing tail due to sublimation. Recent discussions have emerged regarding the possibility of the object releasing mini-probes during its journey.</p>

<p>As it approaches the Sun, NASA and various international observatories have begun monitoring its path to gather data about its structure and chemistry. The object will make close flybys of Mars and Venus before exiting the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have a responsibility to keep the public informed if evidence of life or artificial technology is found,” said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, chairwoman of the House Declassification Task Force.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb stated, “Labeling 3I/ATLAS as just a comet is like calling an elephant a zebra without stripes,” emphasizing the need for open scientific investigation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS object is only the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unusual chemical features and active state far beyond Jupiter's orbit raise questions about its classification and origin.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar objects have sparked debate within the scientific community, particularly regarding their potential to carry technology or signs of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches key celestial bodies, providing opportunities for closer observation and data collection. Further studies are anticipated when the object re-emerges from behind the Sun in November 2025.</p>
