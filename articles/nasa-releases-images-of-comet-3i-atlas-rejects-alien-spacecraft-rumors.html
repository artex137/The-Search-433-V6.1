      <h2>NASA releases images of comet 3I/ATLAS, rejects alien spacecraft 'rumors'</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on Wednesday, following its discovery in July by an ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The space agency has dismissed speculation that the comet is an alien spacecraft, emphasizing its natural characteristics.</p>

<p>The announcement is significant as 3I/ATLAS is considered to be older than our solar system. NASA officials are actively addressing public curiosity and misinformation surrounding the comet's nature, encouraging interest in space exploration.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in the solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that there are no signs of alien technology associated with the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Astronomers have tracked its journey through the solar system since then, noting its unusual trajectory. NASA officials held a briefing on Wednesday to discuss the comet and to clarify misconceptions regarding its nature.</p>

<p>During the briefing, NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya addressed the rumors surrounding the comet, stating, "This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet. And all evidence points to it being a comet."</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "It's natural to wonder what it is. We love that the world wondered along with us," said Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "To start with, I'd like to address the rumors about the nature of 3I/ATLAS," said Amit Kshatriya. "I think it's important that we talk about that."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "We want very much to find signs of life in the universe," Kshatriya added, referring to ongoing NASA missions searching for extraterrestrial life.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object observed traveling through the solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Comets like 3I/ATLAS are composed of rocky and icy materials that evaporate as they approach the sun.</p>

<p>The recent speculation about the comet's nature highlights ongoing public interest in extraterrestrial life and the search for signs of life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, maintaining its stance that the comet poses no threat to Earth. The agency will also focus on its missions aimed at exploring potential signs of life on other planets.</p>
