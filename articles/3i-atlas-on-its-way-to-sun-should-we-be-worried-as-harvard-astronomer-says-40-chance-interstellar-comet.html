      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-27 10:50 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/Atlas Heading Towards the Sun</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, discovered by NASA’s ATLAS telescope, is moving toward its closest point to the Sun, expected around October 30, 2025. There are currently no reported injuries or fatalities related to this celestial event.</p>

<p>This comet has sparked significant scientific interest, particularly following Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb’s claim that there is a 40% chance it could be alien technology. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are studying 3I/Atlas’s path, composition, and behavior to determine if it is a natural object or something more. Both agencies have confirmed that 3I/Atlas poses no threat to Earth, but its approach presents a valuable opportunity for research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>It is expected to pass approximately 1.4 astronomical units (about 210 million kilometers) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will come within 1.8 astronomical units (around 270 million kilometers) of Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be less than one kilometer wide.</li>
    <li>It may be about 7.6 billion years old, predating the Sun by nearly three billion years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was identified by NASA’s ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025. Since its discovery, scientists have tracked its hyperbolic orbital path, confirming its interstellar origin. The comet is set to make its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, providing researchers with a unique opportunity to observe its behavior as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<p>On October 7, 2025, the ESA captured an image of the comet, showcasing its bright coma as it passed near Mars. Currently, 3I/Atlas is difficult to observe from Earth due to its proximity to the Sun, but it is expected to become visible again in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “NASA has confirmed that 3I/Atlas poses no danger to Earth. Instead, it provides a rare opportunity to study material that formed in another star system,” said an ESA spokesperson.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “There is a 40% chance that 3I/Atlas is alien technology,” stated Avi Loeb, who has raised questions about the comet’s unusual features and trajectory.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar object detected, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its discovery and unique characteristics have prompted discussions about the nature of interstellar objects and their implications for understanding the cosmos.</p>

<p>The ESA notes that interstellar objects like 3I/Atlas can provide important insights into the formation of worlds beyond our solar system, making their study crucial for advancing astronomical knowledge.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun. Researchers expect to gather more data on its speed, chemical makeup, and behavior, hoping to clarify whether its unique features are natural phenomena or indicative of alien technology.</p>
