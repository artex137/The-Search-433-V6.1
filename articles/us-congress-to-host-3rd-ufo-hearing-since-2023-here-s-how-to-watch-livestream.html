      <h2>US Congress to host 3rd UFO hearing since 2023</h2>

<p>The U.S. Congress will hold its third hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) on Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2025, at 10 a.m. ET. The hearing will feature testimony from four witnesses, including three military veterans and one journalist, regarding their experiences with UAP and concerns about government transparency.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it follows previous discussions about unexplained objects in U.S. airspace and the military's alleged lack of transparency regarding these phenomena. The House Task Force on Government Transparency aims to address these issues and ensure the public receives clear information about UAPs and their potential implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Time: 10 a.m. ET</li>
    <li>Location: U.S. Congress</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Four, including three military veterans and one journalist</li>
    <li>Hearing title: "Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection"</li>
    <li>Task Force established: February 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The hearing will build on the testimony provided on Nov. 14, 2023, where witnesses discussed unexplained aerial phenomena and the government's efforts to recover and study downed craft. During that session, journalist Michael Shellenberger revealed that intelligence agencies possess high-resolution images of UAPs, contrasting with previously released grainy footage.</p>

<p>Additionally, former military intelligence official Luis Elizondo accused the Department of Defense of concealing UAP programs from Congress and misusing funds intended for them. His statements echoed earlier claims made by Pentagon official David Grusch in July 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans’ safety," said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, who chairs the task force.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Whistleblowers who provide details on spending information and policies and procedures regarding the classification and declassification of UAPs should be able to do so without retribution," Luna added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The term UAP has replaced UFO in official discourse, reflecting a broader understanding that these phenomena can occur in various domains, including air and water. The Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets was established to improve government transparency regarding UAPs, following growing public interest and concern over national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The hearing will provide an opportunity for witnesses to share their insights and experiences regarding UAPs. The Task Force aims to gather information that may lead to improved transparency and accountability from the government on these matters.</p>
