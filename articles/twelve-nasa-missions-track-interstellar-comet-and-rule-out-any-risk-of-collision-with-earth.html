      <h2>Twelve NASA missions track interstellar comet and rule out any risk of collision with Earth</h2>

<p>The United States space agency has mobilized twelve distinct missions to monitor the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to pass Earth on December 19, 2025, at a safe distance of 273 million kilometers. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This coordinated effort aims to gather extensive data on the comet's chemical composition and behavior as it approaches the inner solar system. Preliminary findings have revealed unique characteristics of the comet, marking it as the third interstellar visitor identified by modern science.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at an estimated speed of 246,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth is predicted for December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Initial identification of the comet occurred in the Atacama Desert.</li>
    <li>The comet is confirmed to originate from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.</li>
    <li>The comet will cross the orbit of Jupiter in spring 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA's observation campaign includes the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's monitoring of 3I/ATLAS began when the comet was first identified in the Atacama Desert. Subsequent orbital calculations confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it did not originate in the solar system. Early detection allowed for the activation of the International Asteroid Warning Network, enabling observatories worldwide to adjust their instruments accordingly.</p>

<p>In early October 2025, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured high-resolution images of the comet, which was approximately 30.6 million kilometers away at the time. The Perseverance rover on Mars also recorded data on the comet's passage, providing further insights into its dynamics.</p>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope analyzed the comet's light spectrum, discovering a high concentration of carbon dioxide, which differs from typical comets formed in the solar system. Other missions, including the Psyche and Lucy spacecraft, participated in the observation campaign, enhancing the understanding of the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "All the physical evidence collected points to an object of natural origin," said Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, during a press conference. "The observed behavior includes predictable release of gas and dust, refuting theories about alien technology."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins other notable interstellar visitors such as Oumuamua and Borisov, which have contributed to the understanding of chemical diversity in the Milky Way. Each analyzed interstellar object has shown a unique composition, offering insights into the formation of stellar systems billions of years ago.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and crosses the orbit of Jupiter. Ongoing studies aim to refine models of exoplanet formation and explore how organic materials travel between stars.</p>
