      <h2>Edinburgh dad spots 'reappearing strange UFO lights' beaming over his home</h2>

<p>An Edinburgh father has reported seeing unusual lights in the sky from his flat in Leith, starting from October 20. The 32-year-old hospitality worker recorded footage showing bright lights flashing and moving across the sky, which he claims reappear on multiple nights. He observed the lights from his kitchen window in the Restalrig Park area.</p>

<p>The sightings have raised questions about the nature of the lights. Local residents and online users have speculated about their origins, while authorities have not yet commented on the phenomenon. The incident highlights growing public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The lights began appearing on October 20.</li>
    <li>Observations typically occur between 9 p.m. and midnight.</li>
    <li>The father captured footage from his kitchen window in Restalrig Park.</li>
    <li>The lights are reportedly above Mossmorran and Burntisland.</li>
    <li>In the footage, aircraft can be seen landing at Edinburgh Airport during the sightings.</li>
    <li>The father has shared his experience with his partner and eight-year-old son.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The father first noticed the lights on October 20, with observations continuing for several nights thereafter. He reported seeing the lights primarily between 11:15 p.m. and 11:35 p.m., with some instances starting as early as 9 p.m. He described the lights as reappearing in the same positions multiple times each night.</p>

<p>He has speculated about their nature, mentioning online discussions suggesting they could be Starlink satellites, though he doubts this theory due to their brightness and movement patterns.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I'm unsure what they are, they could be anything at this rate," the father said. "What I find strange is they appear right on an active flightpath, but there has been no shutdown at the airport, or reports of suspicious drones etc."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident occurs amid increasing reports of unidentified aerial phenomena in various parts of the world, including recent sightings in New Jersey, Denmark, and Belgium. The father noted a rise in drone sightings, particularly after a notable incident at Manchester Airport, although no clear images have been captured.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
