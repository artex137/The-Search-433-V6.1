      <h2>Alien Crash Rumours, Secret RAF Police Units And Cold War Bunkers: Mystery Of ‘Area 51’</h2>

<p>RAF Rudloe Manor, located in Wiltshire, has become a focal point for UFO enthusiasts due to its history of secretive military operations and alleged extraterrestrial investigations. The abandoned base, taken over by the Royal Air Force in 1950, has been linked to various conspiracy theories surrounding UFO sightings and military cover-ups, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The significance of RAF Rudloe Manor lies in its past as a Cold War relic where RAF police and secret service personnel conducted operations away from public view.
