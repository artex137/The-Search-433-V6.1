      <h2>CIA refuses to deny it has records monitoring suspected UFO 3I/ATLAS space object</h2>

<p>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has refused to confirm or deny the existence of records related to the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, despite NASA's assertion that it is a comet of natural origin. The CIA's response came on December 31, 2025, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiry from John Greenewald Jr.</p>

<p>This matter has raised questions about government transparency regarding potential threats from unidentified space objects. Authorities are now under scrutiny to explain the implications of their monitoring activities and the rationale behind their classified status.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of CIA FOIA response: December 31, 2025</li>
    <li>Date of NASA press conference: November 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Object in question: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>NASA's classification: Comet of natural origin</li>
    <li>Inquiry made by: John Greenewald Jr.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA officials held a press conference where they stated that 3I/ATLAS was a comet of natural origin. Following this, on December 31, 2025, the CIA responded to a FOIA request from John Greenewald Jr. The agency stated it could “neither deny nor confirm the existence or nonexistence of records” pertaining to 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The fact of documents existing or not existing is classified. The fact of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself currently and properly classified.” 
    — CIA response to FOIA inquiry
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The simplest interpretation of the CIA response to the FOIA request is that some government officials wished to verify that 3I/ATLAS is not a black swan event, posing a potential threat to society...” 
    — Avi Loeb, theoretical physicist
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb, a theoretical physicist at Harvard University, has commented on the CIA's response, suggesting it may aim to prevent public panic regarding potential threats from space. He likened this approach to lessons learned from historical events, indicating that intelligence agencies have been cautious in their communications to avoid causing societal unrest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the nature of 3I/ATLAS and the CIA’s monitoring practices are expected to continue. Authorities may face further pressure to disclose information about their assessments and any potential risks associated with unidentified space objects.</p>
