      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Origins Revealed</h2>
<p>Astronomers have discovered new insights into the origins of comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object first spotted in late June 2025. Researchers believe it likely originated from the far corners of our galaxy and could be billions of years older than the sun, according to the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>This discovery is significant as it may provide clues about the early solar system and the formation of celestial bodies. Scientists have observed unusual properties of the comet, including its ability to eject water at high volumes even when far from the sun. ESA's Mars spacecraft has been deployed to capture closer views of the comet's bright coma.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in late June 2025.</li>
    <li>Researchers estimate the comet could be billions of years older than the sun.</li>
    <li>The comet has been observed ejecting water "like a fire hose."</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency has deployed its Mars spacecraft for closer observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2025, astronomers first spotted comet 3I/ATLAS. Recent studies have revealed its potential origins and age, indicating it may be a remnant from the early galaxy. Observations have continued, with the ESA utilizing its Mars spacecraft to gather additional data on the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet is offering us a unique opportunity to study the building blocks of our solar system,” said a spokesperson from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects, following the detection of 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017. Both objects provide valuable insights into the materials that existed in the early universe, with implications for understanding planetary formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, gathering data to further understand its composition and origin. Additional observations from the ESA's Mars spacecraft are expected in the coming months.</p>
