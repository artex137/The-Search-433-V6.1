      <h2>Scientists issue update on ‘potential hostile alien threat’ as appearance leaves them stunned</h2>

<p>Researchers have reported new findings on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has recently become visible after passing behind the Sun. The comet, first detected by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), is approximately the size of New York and is the third interstellar object recorded to enter our solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this event.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as scientists continue to study the comet's unusual characteristics, which have sparked theories regarding its origins. Observations indicate that 3I/ATLAS has brightened significantly and has displayed a shift in colour from red to blue. Researchers are keen to understand the implications of these findings for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately the size of New York.</li>
    <li>It was first detected by NASA's ATLAS system.</li>
    <li>The comet has become the third interstellar object observed in our solar system.</li>
    <li>It is currently visible in twilight and night skies throughout November and December.</li>
    <li>Data from NASA's STEREO-A and SOHO spacecraft has been used in the study.</li>
    <li>The comet has brightened at a rate seven times faster than typical comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by NASA's ATLAS system, which monitors potential impact threats to Earth. The comet passed behind the Sun earlier this month, making it difficult to observe. Recently, it emerged from this solar conjunction, allowing scientists to gather new data on its characteristics.</p>

<p>In the days following its emergence, three NASA spacecraft observed the comet's closest approach to the Sun. Researchers have noted a rapid increase in brightness and a change in colour, prompting further investigation into its properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reason for 3I/ATLAS's rapid brightening, which far exceeds the brightening rate of most Oort cloud comets at similar distances from the Sun, remains unclear,” said researchers Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This has helped several space-based solar coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers to observe its approach to perihelion,” commented Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist studying the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects, particularly following the detection of previous comets. The unusual properties of these objects have led to various hypotheses regarding their origins, including the possibility of being artificial constructs.</p>

<p>As scientists gather more data, the implications for our understanding of the universe and the potential for extraterrestrial life continue to be explored.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it becomes more visible in the night sky. Observations throughout November and December will provide further insights into its composition and behaviour.</p>
