      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shines in fresh views from Hubble and the Juice spacecraft</h2>

<p>New observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have been captured by the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency’s JUICE spacecraft. The comet, discovered on July 1 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, is the third confirmed object to enter our solar system from another star system. JUICE and Hubble observed the comet in November as it moved through the inner solar system.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it provides insights into material that formed around another star. The observations help scientists understand the comet's activity and composition, contributing to knowledge about the origins of celestial bodies. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will not pass near any planets as it exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>JUICE observed the comet on November 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>Hubble captured images of the comet on November 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet passed its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>JUICE is expected to provide a full dataset in February 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet will cross Jupiter’s orbit in 2026.</li>
    <li>It is currently about 41 million miles from JUICE.</li>
    <li>The comet will remain at least 170 million miles from Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, during observations by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet passed its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023, marking a peak in its activity. JUICE observed the comet on November 2, 2023, and Hubble followed up with new images on November 30, 2023.</p>
<p>During its observations, JUICE was limited in data transmission due to its main antenna being used as a heat shield. However, a preview image was sent back to provide early insights into the comet’s structure and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet’s long journey through interstellar space gives me goosebumps to think about,” said a scientist involved in the study.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We couldn’t wait that long for the full data release,” said an ESA representative regarding the early image from JUICE.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The comet’s dust shows slightly atypical properties,” noted NASA based on recent findings.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The comet’s high incoming speed suggests it may have been born in an ancient system,” said another researcher.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following previous discoveries. The study of such comets allows scientists to compare their properties with those of comets from our own solar system, enhancing understanding of their formation and evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists expect to receive detailed data about 3I/ATLAS in February 2026, following further observations and analysis. The coordinated observation campaign by NASA will continue to track the comet's activity and chemical features as it moves through the solar system.</p>
