      <h2>ATLAS Alert: 3I/ATLAS Comet Perihelion Looms—NASA Defense vs Alien Claims</h2>

<p>NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) is monitoring the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its perihelion on 29 October 2025. Discovered on 1 July 2025, the comet poses no immediate risk to Earth, according to NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

<p>This event highlights the importance of planetary defense against potential cosmic threats. NASA has activated elements of its Strategy for Planetary Defense, coordinating with the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) for an astrometry campaign to monitor the comet's trajectory and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
  <li>Approaching perihelion on 29–30 October 2025, at approximately 1.4 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun.</li>
  <li>Safe minimum distance from Earth is 1.8 AU.</li>
  <li>NASA's ATLAS system operates with four telescopes located in Hawaii, Chile, and South Africa.</li>
  <li>IAWN will coordinate an astrometry campaign from November 2025 to January 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the Chile-based ATLAS telescope first detected comet 3I/ATLAS in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile. The comet has since been observed as it travels at hyperbolic speeds, confirming its extrasolar origin. Its perihelion is set for 29 October 2025, prompting increased monitoring efforts from NASA and ESA.</p>
<p>The campaign led by IAWN will begin in November 2025, aimed at refining orbital predictions and testing observation protocols for the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The campaign will target comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) to exercise the capability of the observing community to extract accurate astrometry,” stated the Minor Planet Center bulletin.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Its discovery has reignited discussions around potential alien technology, with astronomers like Avi Loeb suggesting a 40 per cent chance of such origins due to its unusual behavior near perihelion.</p>
<p>NASA's ATLAS system has been instrumental in identifying over 100 near-Earth objects (NEOs) annually, enhancing global readiness for cosmic threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue its monitoring efforts through the IAWN astrometry campaign, which runs until January 2026. Future projects like the NEO Surveyor, set to launch no earlier than 2027, aim to improve tracking of interstellar threats.</p>
