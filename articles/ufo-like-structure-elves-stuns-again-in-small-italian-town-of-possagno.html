      <h2>UFO-like structure ELVEs stuns again in small Italian town of Possagno</h2>

<p>A mysterious halo of red light, known as ELVEs, has reappeared over Possagno, Italy, on November 17, 2025. This phenomenon was first observed by residents two years ago. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This rare atmospheric event has captured public attention and prompted interest from scientists. Authorities and meteorologists are studying the phenomenon to understand its implications better. According to photographer Valter Binotto, who has documented the occurrence, the halo is not extraterrestrial but rather a natural occurrence linked to lightning.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>The ELVEs phenomenon was observed on November 17, 2025.</li>
<li>Possagno is located in the foothills of the Italian Alps.</li>
<li>Binotto first captured the phenomenon in 2023.</li>
<li>The halo measures approximately 200 kilometres in diameter and is about 100 kilometres above ground.</li>
<li>The latest event originated from a storm in Ancona, 280 kilometres away; the previous one came from Vernazza, 300 kilometres away.</li>
<li>ELVEs are formed by electromagnetic pulses from powerful lightning strikes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, residents of Possagno first witnessed the red halo phenomenon, which went unexplained at the time. Valter Binotto captured the first images of the ELVEs that year. On November 17, 2025, the halo appeared again, leading to renewed curiosity and investigation into the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The halo is what is called ELVEs, a rare lightning-related phenomenon,” said Binotto. “Witnessing it twice in the same location is somewhat of an atmospheric miracle.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>ELVEs, or "emission of light and very low-frequency perturbations due to electromagnetic pulse sources," are extremely rare. NASA did not identify the phenomenon until 1990. The occurrence of ELVEs in Possagno is not unique; they can be visible over large distances due to their high-altitude nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists and meteorologists will continue to study the phenomenon to gain a deeper understanding of its causes and implications. Further observations may occur during lightning storms in the region.</p>
