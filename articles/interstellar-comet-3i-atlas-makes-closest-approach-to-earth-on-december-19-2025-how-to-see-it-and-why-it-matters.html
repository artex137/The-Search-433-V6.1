      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Makes Closest Approach to Earth on December 19, 2025</h2>

<p>On Friday, December 19, 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest pass to Earth at a distance of about 170 million miles (270 million kilometers). The comet poses no danger, but it presents a rare opportunity for astronomers and skywatchers to observe the third confirmed interstellar object in history.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it allows scientists to study the composition and behavior of a comet from outside our solar system. Various space agencies, including NASA and ESA, are currently observing the comet with multiple missions to gather data before it disappears back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Active interstellar comet</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 153,000 mph (246,000 km/h) near closest approach</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Nucleus estimated between 440 m and 5.6 km across</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Rich in carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, cyanide, and nickel</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025, at around 06:00 UTC</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025, by ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope. Upon its discovery, astronomers noted its hyperbolic orbit, indicating it originated from outside the solar system. Following its trajectory, it was confirmed that the comet would pass near Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>As the comet approached, NASA and ESA initiated a multi-mission observing campaign. Various spacecraft, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN, began capturing images and data to study the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS won’t come close to Earth at all by planetary-defence standards,” NASA stated. “It will stay nearly twice as far away as the Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic trajectory and composition provide a unique opportunity to study materials that formed around another star, offering insight into the evolution of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<p>Researchers believe that 3I/ATLAS could be the oldest comet ever observed, with estimates suggesting it is between 7 and 14 billion years old, predating the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will analyze the data collected from various missions. Observations will focus on its composition and behavior, particularly any signs of cryovolcanic activity, before the comet moves out of reach for further study.</p>
