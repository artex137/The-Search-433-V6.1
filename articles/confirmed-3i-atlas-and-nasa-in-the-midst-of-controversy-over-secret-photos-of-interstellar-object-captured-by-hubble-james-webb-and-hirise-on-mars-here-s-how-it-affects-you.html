      <h2>Confirmed - 3I/ATLAS and NASA in the midst of controversy over secret photos of interstellar object captured by Hubble, James Webb and HiRISE on Mars</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that it possesses images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, but has not yet released them. The images were captured by Hubble, James Webb, and HiRISE on Mars. The agency has stated that the images are still undergoing analysis and calibration.</p>

<p>This situation has generated significant public interest and speculation. Many researchers and amateur astronomers are eager for NASA to disclose the images and data. The agency's decision to withhold the images has raised questions about the reasons for the delay and the potential implications of the comet’s characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed its perihelion and is currently not observable directly.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed the existence of images captured by Hubble, James Webb, and HiRISE.</li>
    <li>The images are undergoing calibration, color adjustment, and noise cleaning.</li>
    <li>NASA prioritizes precision over speed in releasing the images.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is one of the three largest comets ever observed, alongside Borisov and Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>The comet has unique characteristics regarding its formation, size, and speed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS passed its perihelion, moving behind the Sun, which limited direct observation for several days. Prior to this, multiple observatories, including Hubble and James Webb, managed to capture images of the comet. NASA has stated that these images are currently being refined and prepared for release.</p>

<p>NASA has acknowledged the public's anticipation for the images but emphasizes the importance of accuracy in their presentation. The agency aims to release all relevant data, including images and spectra, simultaneously to prevent misinterpretations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The priority is the precision of the images and not the speed, especially because there is a lot of expectation around this topic.” - NASA spokesperson</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest surrounding 3I/ATLAS mirrors previous incidents involving interstellar objects, such as Oumuamua, which drew significant public and scientific scrutiny. NASA's cautious approach is likely influenced by the desire to avoid misinterpretations and ensure the scientific integrity of the data presented.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the data collected on 3I/ATLAS. The agency has not disclosed a specific timeline for when the images will be released, but it aims to publish all findings comprehensively to address public curiosity and scientific inquiry.
