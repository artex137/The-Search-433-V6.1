      <h2>Rhythmic jets in the tail of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS allow unprecedented measurement of its rotation</h2>

<p>Researchers have observed rhythmic jets in the tail of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, allowing unprecedented measurements of its rotation. The findings were reported on February 20, 2026, by a team of astronomers studying the comet's behaviour as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances understanding of the comet's physical characteristics and rotational dynamics. Scientists have begun detailed analyses of the data collected, which may provide insights into the formation and evolution of comets in general.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in December 2019.</li>
    <li>The observations were made using telescopes based in various locations, including North America and Europe.</li>
    <li>Measurements of the comet's rotation have been unprecedented in their accuracy.</li>
    <li>The study was published on February 20, 2026.</li>
    <li>The research team includes astronomers from multiple institutions, although specific names were not disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2019, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered, sparking interest from the astronomical community. Over the following years, observations have continued as the comet approaches the inner solar system.</p>
<p>By February 2026, researchers reported significant findings regarding the rhythmic jets in the comet's tail, which allowed them to measure its rotation with greater precision than ever before.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This study marks a major milestone in our understanding of cometary behaviour,” said a lead researcher from the team. “The data we have gathered will help us unlock the mysteries of comet formation and evolution.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects that have been detected passing through the solar system. Previous studies of other comets have provided insights into their composition and trajectory, but the detailed rotational measurements of 3I/ATLAS represent a new frontier in comet research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from comet 3I/ATLAS in the coming months. Future observations are planned as the comet approaches perihelion, which may yield additional insights into its behaviour and characteristics.</p>
