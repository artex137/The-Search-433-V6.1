      <h2>Chinese Probe Reveals Details of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The Administração Espacial Nacional of China (CNSA) has confirmed the acquisition of crucial visual data regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by the Tianwen-1 probe in orbit around Mars. This significant recording, completed in October 2022, has provided scientists with unique observations of the comet's brightness and structure dynamics, enhancing understanding of celestial bodies from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>This data is vital for understanding the composition and behavior of interstellar comets. CNSA engineers made precise adjustments to the Tianwen-1 probe's high-resolution camera to capture these images, ensuring the success of the operation. The findings are part of a collaborative effort with European probes to analyze the non-gravitational acceleration of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed at an approximate distance of 30 million kilometers from Tianwen-1.</li>
    <li>The probe captured images in October 2022, revealing high-resolution details of the comet's coma and displacement.</li>
    <li>The estimated age of comet 3I/ATLAS ranges between 3 and 11 billion years.</li>
    <li>The comet's core is a few kilometers in diameter, with a coma extending up to 100,000 kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is on a trajectory to exit the Solar System after passing through perihelion at the end of 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2022, the Tianwen-1 probe captured crucial visual data of comet 3I/ATLAS. This marked the first time that scientists could observe the comet from such a unique perspective, enhancing understanding of its composition and behavior. The data gathered has since been processed into animations that illustrate the movement of particles and variations in the comet’s luminosity.</p>

<p>Subsequent analysis combined data from Tianwen-1 with information from the European Space Agency’s ExoMars TGO and Mars Express missions, allowing researchers to triangulate photometric and morphological data more precisely.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The integration of information collected by Tianwen-1 with ESA missions was essential to eliminate geometric ambiguities in the observations,” CNSA officials stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to cross the Solar System. Its unique characteristics, including a chemical composition indicative of a distant stellar environment, distinguish it from native Solar System comets. The study of such comets is crucial for understanding the early solar system and the origins of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS, focusing on the driving forces behind its acceleration and the implications for future missions, including the Tianwen-2 mission, which aims to sample asteroids.</p>
