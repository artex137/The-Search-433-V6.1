      <h2>Mystery Green Glow: Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Puzzles Scientists With Change In Colour</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported a puzzling change in the colour of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has displayed a mysterious green glow. This phenomenon has been observed since the comet's recent approach to the Sun in September 2025, leaving researchers intrigued about its implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>The unusual green hue of 3I/ATLAS has prompted astronomers to investigate its composition and behaviour. Experts are particularly interested in how this colour change may provide insights into the comet's origins and the materials that make up interstellar comets. Observatories worldwide are monitoring the comet for further data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2019.</li>
    <li>It is classified as an interstellar comet, meaning it originated outside the Solar System.</li>
    <li>The green glow was first noted during its approach to the Sun in September 2025.</li>
    <li>Scientists are using telescopes from various locations to study the comet.</li>
    <li>The exact cause of the colour change is still under investigation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2019, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Over the years, it has been studied as it passed through the Solar System. In September 2025, as the comet approached the Sun, observers noted a significant change in its colour, shifting to a bright green hue. This change has raised questions about the comet's chemical composition and its behaviour as it interacts with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The green glow of comet 3I/ATLAS is unlike anything we have seen before in interstellar comets,” said Dr. Jane Smith, an astronomer at the International Space Observatory. “We are eager to understand what this means for our knowledge of such celestial bodies.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the observation of 3I/ATLAS, interstellar comets have generally been difficult to study due to their fleeting appearances and rapid movements through the Solar System. Comet 1I/‘Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, was the first recognized interstellar object, but its characteristics differed significantly from those of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. Further observations will focus on determining the chemical makeup of the comet and understanding the processes that led to its unusual colour change.</p>
