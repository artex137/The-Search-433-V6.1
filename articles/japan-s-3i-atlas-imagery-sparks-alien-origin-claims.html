      <h2>Japan’s 3I/Atlas imagery sparks alien origin claims</h2>

<p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has not confirmed the authenticity of a viral image purporting to show the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025, according to reports published on November 10, 2025. The image, claimed to be the most realistic depiction of the comet, has generated renewed interest and speculation about its origins and composition.</p>

<p>This situation has prompted discussions regarding the protocols for data release by space agencies. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its interstellar trajectory and chemical anomalies, have led some researchers to reconsider existing assumptions about how such objects behave within our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (officially C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Visible to Observers:</strong> Early November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Exceeding 130,000 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Key Observational Tools:</strong> Hubble Space Telescope, ground-based telescopes</li>
    <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> Visible in the pre-dawn sky, requiring a telescope for observation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS sky survey on July 1, 2025. The Hubble Space Telescope captured its first visible-light image on July 21, showing a teardrop-shaped dust cocoon. The comet reached its perihelion on October 30, 2025. It emerged from behind the Sun in early November and is now observable in the pre-dawn sky.</p>
<p>Recent observations have revealed a pronounced green light gas and dust jet directed towards the Sun, along with unusual chemical signatures, such as high nickel vapor emissions. These findings have sparked interest among astronomers and researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While the image attributed to JAXA has been widely shared, there is no official release verifying its content,” a JAXA spokesperson said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The absence of formal acknowledgment leaves open possibilities: the image might stem from processed public-dataset composites, mis-labeled data, or even hoaxes,” an expert noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time that claims regarding alien origins or unusual characteristics of celestial objects have arisen. The comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 2I/Borisov and 1I/ʻOumuamua. Its unique chemistry, particularly the ratio of CO₂ to H₂O in its coma, suggests it formed in a different stellar environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it departs the inner solar system. Coordinated campaigns involving ground-based telescopes and data from space probes are underway, with a priority on obtaining public, peer-reviewed data releases from space agencies.</p>
