      <h2>City-size, cold-volcano comet transforms into a glowing 'snail shell' after major explosive outburst</h2>

<p>Comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann has undergone a significant transformation into a giant spiral shape following a major cryovolcanic eruption on February 10, 2023. The comet is now shining 100 times brighter than usual, according to Spaceweather.com.</p>

<p>This event is notable as it ranks among the top five eruptions of the comet in the last 25 years. Experts are observing the unusual spiral shape of the comet's expanding coma, which may provide insights into its internal processes. Researchers continue to monitor the comet's activity, as it has experienced an average of 20 eruptions per year, with this latest one being the most powerful since October 2024.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Eruption:</strong> February 10, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness Increase:</strong> 100-fold</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 37 miles (60 kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Between Jupiter and Saturn, approximately six times farther from the Sun than Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Average Eruptions:</strong> 20 per year</li>
    <li><strong>Recent Eruption:</strong> Followed by a smaller outburst on February 15, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 10, 2023, Comet 29P experienced a major brightening event, resulting in its significant increase in luminosity. This eruption is considered one of its most powerful in recent history.</p>
<p>In the following days, researchers observed an unusual spiral shape in the comet's coma, which diverged from the typical symmetrical pattern. This phenomenon is believed to be caused by internal rotations and uneven cryomagma outflow.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unusual shape likely results from an internal rotation of the comet's interior relative to its nucleus,” said experts from Spaceweather.com.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 29P is part of a unique group of around 500 objects known as "centaurs," which orbit the Sun between Jupiter and Saturn. Unlike many cryovolcanic comets that only erupt when they approach the Sun, 29P maintains a relatively stable distance, leading to its frequent eruptions.</p>
<p>This comet has presented challenges for researchers, as the triggers for its larger outbursts remain unclear despite stable conditions. A previous prediction of a major eruption in April 2023 was based on a mini dimming event, yet the reasons behind the eruptions are still being studied.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor Comet 29P for further activity and changes in its coma. Observations are expected to provide more data on the comet's cryovolcanic processes and its unique spiral formation.</p>
