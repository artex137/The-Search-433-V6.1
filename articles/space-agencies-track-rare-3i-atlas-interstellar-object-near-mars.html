      <h2>Space agencies track rare 3I/ATLAS interstellar object near Mars</h2>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are tracking the 3I/ATLAS interstellar object as it travels past Mars on its way toward the Sun. The object, believed to be a comet, is the third interstellar object identified within the solar system. Scientists first discovered 3I/ATLAS in July and it passed Mars at a distance of 23.6 million miles.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides valuable data on interstellar objects and their characteristics. NASA's Mars Perseverance rover may have captured images of 3I/ATLAS during its flyby. ESA officials have also directed cameras on two Mars orbiters to observe the object as it continues its journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of discovery: July 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 23.6 million miles</li>
    <li>Length of streak captured: approximately 31,000 miles</li>
    <li>NASA rover involved: Mars Perseverance</li>
    <li>ESA orbiters involved: ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, Mars Express</li>
    <li>Next opportunity for observation: November 2023</li>
    <li>Planned ESA mission: 2029 Comet Interceptor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, scientists discovered the 3I/ATLAS interstellar object. The object passed Mars at a distance of 23.6 million miles, with the Mars Perseverance rover capturing a streak of light in its images. ESA's Mars orbiters also aimed their cameras at 3I/ATLAS from Wednesday through Tuesday to gather data.</p>

<p>The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter successfully captured a series of digital images of the object, while Mars Express attempted to capture images with its spectrometers, but was not successful. ESA officials noted that another opportunity for observation will arise in November when 3I/ATLAS is near the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it's always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one,” said Colin Wilson, ESA project scientist for the Mars orbiters. “I look forward to seeing what the data reveals following further analysis.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The identification of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects, following the discovery of just two others prior to this one. The upcoming 2029 Comet Interceptor mission aims to intercept another comet from the Oort Cloud or another interstellar visitor, enhancing our understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves closer to the Sun. Data from the Mars orbiters will be analyzed to confirm the identity of the captured images and further insights will be gathered during the November observation opportunity.</p>
