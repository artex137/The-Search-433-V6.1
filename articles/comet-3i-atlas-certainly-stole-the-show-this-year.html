      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS certainly stole the show this year</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has garnered significant attention since its discovery in the summer of 2025, marking its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 168 million miles just before Christmas. The comet, believed to be up to 7.6 billion years old, is a relic from outside our solar system, travelling at speeds reaching 36 miles per second. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This event is notable as it represents the third interstellar object to visit our solar system in the last decade. Authorities have noted the comet's unique characteristics and have encouraged the public to observe its trajectory, although it will not return due to its orbit. The fascination surrounding 3I/ATLAS has sparked interest in future celestial events.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in summer 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 168 million miles</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 7.6 billion years</li>
    <li>Nucleus size: approximately 3.5 miles wide</li>
    <li>Tail length: over 35,000 miles</li>
    <li>Speed: up to 36 miles per second</li>
    <li>No reported injuries or fatalities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in the summer of 2025, leading to widespread speculation about its origins. It made its closest approach to Earth on December 24, 2025, after having passed Mars and the Sun earlier that month. Following this encounter, the comet continued on its path out of the solar system, marking its exit.</p>

<p>In the same year, Asteroid 2024 YR4 raised concerns about a potential collision with Earth, with a probability of impact that peaked at 2.3 percent. However, this risk has since diminished.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We will never see 3I/ATLAS again due to its orbit, but it has provided a fascinating glimpse into the cosmos,” said a spokesperson from the Royal Astronomical Society.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to have been observed in the solar system in the last ten years, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. These events have heightened interest in celestial phenomena and the study of objects from beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>In addition to the excitement around 3I/ATLAS, NASA's Artemis II mission is slated for February 2026, aiming to return humans to lunar orbit for the first time since 1972.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS exits the solar system, astronomers will continue to monitor other celestial bodies, including Asteroid 2024 YR4, which now has a reduced chance of impacting Earth. Future missions, such as Artemis III, are also on the horizon, with plans to land humans on the Moon.</p>
