      <h2>Manhattan-sized space object 3I/ATLAS has grown a tail</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, measuring the size of Manhattan, has developed a tail, suggesting it could potentially be an alien craft, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. New images captured by Spain’s Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands in September show the object exhibiting a true cometary tail as it approaches the sun.</p>

<p>This development follows the object's earlier indication of an “anti-tail” since its appearance in the solar system in July. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has added 3I/ATLAS to its monitoring list, stating that while it poses no threat, it offers a significant opportunity for scientific research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>The object will come closest to the sun on October 29, at a distance of 1.8 times further than the Earth is from the sun.</li>
    <li>Images taken by NASA’s HiRISE camera are pending release due to a government shutdown.</li>
    <li>The IAWN began monitoring 3I/ATLAS earlier this week.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS first appeared in the solar system in July 2025. It exhibited signs of an unusual anti-tail, primarily composed of carbon dioxide and water, along with trace amounts of cyanide and a unique nickel alloy. In September 2025, new images indicated the formation of a cometary tail.</p>
<p>The IAWN added 3I/ATLAS to its list of targets in late October 2025, initiating monitoring for scientific purposes. The object will reach its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While it poses no threat, comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and its high interest to the scientific community,” the IAWN stated on its website.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb noted, “If the object is an alien spacecraft slowing down, then the anti-tail would be evidence of a braking thrust maneuver which would naturally change to a tail as the slowing procedure completed.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The development of 3I/ATLAS has sparked interest among scientists, particularly due to its unusual characteristics. The object's anti-tail and subsequent tail formation raise questions about its nature and origins, with the possibility of it being a controlled maneuvering craft.</p>
<p>Previous studies of interstellar objects have primarily focused on their composition and trajectories, but 3I/ATLAS has drawn attention for its potential implications regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are awaiting the release of high-resolution images from NASA’s HiRISE camera, which could provide further insight into 3I/ATLAS. The ongoing government shutdown may delay these images, but monitoring and analysis by the IAWN will continue as the object approaches the sun.</p>
