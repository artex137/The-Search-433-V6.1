      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS a comet or ‘manoeuvring’ alien craft? Harvard astrophysicist reveals</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may exhibit characteristics indicating 'controlled manoeuvring' by an alien spacecraft. His comments follow recent observations of the object captured by the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands, Spain, in September 2025.</p>

<p>The findings regarding 3I/ATLAS are significant as they challenge existing understandings of interstellar objects. Loeb's claims have sparked debate within the scientific community, prompting further scrutiny of the object’s behaviour and composition. Although some scientists remain sceptical, the potential implications of these observations have drawn global attention.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First spotted: July 2025 by ATLAS survey telescope</li>
    <li>Latest observation: September 2025 by Nordic Optical Telescope</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2025, at approximately 1.36 astronomical units (AU)</li>
    <li>Estimated solar radiation stripping material: up to 33 gigawatts</li>
    <li>Emission detected: nickel tetracarbonyl, a compound not previously found in natural comets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. Subsequent observations in August and September revealed unusual characteristics, including a gas jet directed toward the Sun and a rare "anti-solar tail." The anti-tail changed to a regular tail as the object approached its perihelion.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb published a paper detailing these observations and speculating about the possibility of the object being an alien craft. He noted that the transition from an anti-tail to a tail could indicate controlled manoeuvring.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "If the object is an alien spacecraft slowing down, and the anti-tail is braking thrust, then this change from anti-tail to tail would be entirely expected near perihelion." He added, "This transition would constitute a technosignature in the form of an unexpected phenomenon indicative of controlled manoeuvring."</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA has clarified that the object will pass Earth at a safe distance, posing no danger.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS have reignited discussions about the nature of interstellar objects. Historically, such objects have been studied primarily as natural phenomena, but Loeb's claims have introduced the possibility of artificial constructs. The scientific community remains divided, with many researchers asserting that the object's features align with typical cometary behaviour.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and analyses of 3I/ATLAS are expected as it approaches the Sun. Ongoing discussions within the scientific community may lead to additional research into the characteristics of interstellar objects.</p>
