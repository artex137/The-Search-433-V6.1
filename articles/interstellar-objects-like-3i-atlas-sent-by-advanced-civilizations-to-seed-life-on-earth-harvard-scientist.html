      <h2>Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS sent by advanced civilizations to ‘seed’ life on Earth: Harvard scientist</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has asserted that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may have origins beyond Earth, suggesting it could be part of a broader phenomenon involving extraterrestrial civilizations. This claim was made in a blog post on Medium and reported on December 5, 2025. Loeb argues that Earth has likely experienced previous encounters with advanced civilizations.</p>

<p>Loeb’s assertions highlight the potential implications for our understanding of life in the universe. He emphasizes that this idea warrants serious consideration as it may reshape our scientific perspectives and priorities regarding space exploration. Authorities in the scientific community are now examining these claims and their ramifications for future research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Scientist:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li><strong>Object of Interest:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Claim:</strong> December 5, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Objects:</strong> 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Timeframe of Earth’s Existence:</strong> 4.6 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Period:</strong> Last decade for interstellar objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In his blog post, Loeb discusses the history of interstellar objects impacting Earth. He notes that meter-scale rocks from interstellar space may strike Earth approximately once every decade, suggesting that the planet could have experienced around half a billion such collisions over its history.</p>

<p>Loeb highlights that recorded human history spans roughly 6,000 years, which is a small fraction of the time Earth has been monitored for interstellar activity. He notes that the discovery of interstellar objects has only gained traction in the last decade.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There were plenty of opportunities for residents of previous stars to visit our place,” Loeb told the Post. “It really depends on their agenda. But if there is an interstellar gardener, then obviously it could have intervened….it could have seeded the various forms of life on Earth intentionally.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In terms of interstellar objects, it’s only over the past decade that we started finding them,” he added, noting technological limitations in detecting distant objects.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb’s comments come amid a growing interest in the search for extraterrestrial life and the implications of interstellar travel. The scientific community has previously debated the existence of advanced civilizations and their potential interactions with Earth.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have sparked discussions regarding the origins and nature of these celestial visitors. Loeb’s hypothesis about 3I/ATLAS adds a new dimension to these conversations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in Loeb’s claims grows, further investigation into the nature of 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects is expected. Researchers may explore funding allocations and priorities in space exploration to address these new theories and their implications for humanity.</p>
