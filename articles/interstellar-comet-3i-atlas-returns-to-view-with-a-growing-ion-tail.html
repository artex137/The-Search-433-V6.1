      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Returns to View with a Growing Ion Tail</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has returned to view with a growing ion tail, captured in new images from the Virtual Telescope Project on November 11, 2025. The comet, which first gained attention in mid-2025, is currently visible in the morning sky after moving behind the Sun in late October.</p>

<p>The return of comet 3I/ATLAS is significant for astronomers, as it provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. Observatories worldwide, including ESA and NASA facilities, are collecting data to better understand the comet's composition and its implications for interstellar chemistry.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS first detected in mid-2025.</li>
    <li>New images taken on November 11, 2025, show a distinct ion tail.</li>
    <li>Comet is on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it will not return.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes have provided key data.</li>
    <li>Virtual Telescope Project scheduled a public livestream for November 17, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was initially detected in mid-2025 due to its rapid motion and unusual path. Following its discovery, astronomers confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, classifying it as the third confirmed interstellar object in our solar system. After moving behind the Sun in late October 2025, the comet re-emerged in November, prompting renewed observations.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2025, the Virtual Telescope Project captured images of the comet, showing a longer ion tail, indicating increased activity. The comet's ion tail forms as solar radiation strips electrons from gas molecules, pushing ions outward.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fresh images clearly demonstrate the comet’s steady outgassing and the effects of solar radiation on its surface,” said Gianluca Masi, of the Virtual Telescope Project. “This is a unique chance to observe an interstellar object in detail.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed in our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. Its classification has triggered global interest, as interstellar comets can provide insights into the material that forms around other stars. Previous studies have shown that such objects may carry altered surface compositions due to long-term exposure to cosmic radiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to gather data on 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. The information collected will aid in refining models of interstellar objects and enhance future search efforts for similar comets.</p>
