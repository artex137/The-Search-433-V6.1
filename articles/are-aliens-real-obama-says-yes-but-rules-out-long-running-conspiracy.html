      <h2>Are aliens real? Obama says yes but rules out long-running conspiracy</h2>

<p>Former US president Barack Obama has stated that aliens are real, but they are not located at Nevada’s Area 51. In a podcast interview on October 29, 2023, with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama shared his views on extraterrestrial life but did not provide evidence of their existence.</p>

<p>This statement has generated significant attention and speculation on social media. Following the interview, Obama issued a clarification on Instagram, emphasizing that while the universe is vast and life beyond Earth is statistically likely, he saw no evidence of alien contact during his presidency.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Obama appeared on Brian Tyler Cohen's podcast on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>He stated, “They’re not being kept in Area 51” during a rapid-fire question segment.</li>
    <li>Area 51 is located about 90 miles (144 km) northwest of Las Vegas.</li>
    <li>The CIA declassified documents confirming Area 51's existence in 2013.</li>
    <li>In 2019, a viral Facebook event attracted over 2 million people to “storm” Area 51.</li>
    <li>52% of Americans believe extraterrestrial life exists, according to an Ipsos poll.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1955, Area 51 was established as a test site for high-tech aircraft, including the U-2 spy plane. The US government did not officially acknowledge the site until 2013, when the CIA released documents confirming its use. In September 2019, a social media event led to a surge of interest in Area 51, culminating in the Alienstock festival.</p>

<p>On October 29, 2023, Obama discussed the existence of aliens during a podcast interview, stating that, while he had not seen any evidence of extraterrestrial life, the vastness of the universe makes it statistically plausible.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has long been associated with conspiracy theories about alien technology and UFOs. The site has inspired a subculture in Southern Nevada, with businesses like the Area 51 Alien Centre and the Little A’Le’Inn catering to enthusiasts. In 1996, the state named Nevada Route 375 the Extraterrestrial Highway due to its proximity to Area 51. An Ipsos poll conducted during the Storm Area 51 event revealed widespread belief in the existence of UFOs at the site.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No further investigations or official actions have been announced regarding Obama’s comments or the ongoing speculation about Area 51. The discourse surrounding extraterrestrial life is likely to continue, as interest in the topic remains high among the public.</p>
