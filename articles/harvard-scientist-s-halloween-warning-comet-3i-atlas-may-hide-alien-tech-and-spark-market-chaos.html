      <h2>Harvard Scientist’s Halloween Warning: Comet 3I/ATLAS May Hide Alien Tech and Spark Market Chaos</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey, is on a hyperbolic trajectory and will reach its closest point to the Sun around October 29, 2025. The comet, which is not expected to pose any threat to Earth, has sparked discussions about its potential nature and implications for global markets.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it is only the third object observed coming from beyond our Solar System. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have confirmed that it will not approach Earth closer than approximately 1.8 AU (about 270 million km), and there is no impact threat. However, Harvard astronomer Dr. Avi Loeb has raised concerns that the object might not be a natural comet but potentially alien technology, which could have serious implications for financial markets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) is expected around October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Estimated speed: ~58 km/s.</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth will be no closer than ~1.8 AU (~270 million km).</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb estimates a "40% chance" it is some form of spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Comet will pass Mars at approximately 30 million km on October 3, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey. By late August, telescopes noted unusual features, including an “anti-tail.” On October 3, the comet made a close pass by Mars, which was photographed by ESA orbiters. As it approaches perihelion on October 29, 2025, astronomers are preparing for a critical observation period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet,” said Dr. Michael Küppers of the European Space Agency, emphasizing the consensus among astronomers regarding the comet's behavior.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS changes trajectory in an unexpected way after rounding the Sun, it would imply intelligent control,” Dr. Loeb stated, highlighting the potential implications for humanity.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is unprecedented in its size and speed compared to other interstellar comets. Astronomers have noted its active behavior, including a visible coma and tail. Previous interstellar visitors have not exhibited the same characteristics, prompting speculation about the comet's true nature. The scientific consensus, however, remains that it behaves like a typical comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, scientists will closely observe its behavior. The upcoming days are critical for separating scientific fact from speculation, particularly regarding its trajectory after passing the Sun. Financial markets are also on alert for potential impacts related to the comet's observations.</p>
