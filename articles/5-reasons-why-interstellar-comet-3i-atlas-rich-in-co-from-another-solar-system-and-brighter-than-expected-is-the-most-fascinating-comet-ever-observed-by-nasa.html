      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Captivates Scientists with Unique Characteristics</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense protocol after detecting unusual behavior in comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object that has drawn significant interest due to its unique chemical composition. The technical notice was released on Tuesday, October 21, through the Minor Planet Center's MPEC bulletin (2025-U142).</p>

<p>This detection has prompted the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) to coordinate a special training exercise from November 27, 2023, to January 27, 2026. The goal of this initiative is to improve the accuracy of the comet's orbital measurements, which pose "unique challenges," according to NASA. This effort aims to reliably predict the comet's trajectory as it approaches its closest point to the Sun, expected on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar visitor detected entering the Solar System.</li>
    <li>The first observation was made in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It has a CO₂ to water ice ratio of approximately eight to one.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA plans to observe the comet with the Juno spacecraft during its next pass near Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The first observation of comet 3I/ATLAS occurred in July 2023. Early observations revealed that the comet was emitting a bright glow, despite being far from the Sun. This behavior is atypical as most comets only exhibit significant luminosity when they approach the Sun.</p>

<p>Following its detection, NASA released a technical notice on October 21, 2023, activating the planetary defense protocol. The IAWN announced a special training exercise aimed at improving orbital measurements between November 27, 2023, and January 27, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects are the only things we have ever obtained physical observations of that originate from outside our solar system,” said astrophysicist Jacqueline McCleary of Northeastern University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It’s a window into what pristine material represents for other solar systems,” McCleary added. “It helps us refine our models of planetary formation and understand why our system might be capable of supporting life.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was ejected from another planetary system and has traveled for millions of years through deep space. Its unusual characteristics, including forming a coma beyond Jupiter's orbit, have sparked discussions about its origins and composition. Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have confirmed its rich carbon dioxide content, providing insights into the environment in which it formed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA intends to use the Juno spacecraft for close observations of comet 3I/ATLAS during its upcoming pass near Jupiter. This encounter will allow scientists to gather more information about the comet's structure and composition, further expanding our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
