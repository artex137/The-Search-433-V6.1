      <h2>In the late 1800s, alien ‘engineers’ altered our world forever</h2>

<p>On 16 December 2017, The New York Times published a series of reports confirming the existence of a secret program within the US Department of Defense that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) has uncovered significant evidence of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), including videos showing craft that move with remarkable speed and agility. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these events.</p>

<p>This matter has significant implications for public understanding of UFOs and government transparency. Authorities have acknowledged the existence of such programs, prompting discussions on the potential for extraterrestrial life and the implications of advanced technology. The ongoing revelations have spurred interest in how these phenomena may affect national security and public perception.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> 16 December 2017</li>
<li><strong>Program:</strong> Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)</li>
<li><strong>Findings:</strong> Evidence of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP)</li>
<li><strong>Notable event:</strong> Video evidence presented to Congress in 2025</li>
<li><strong>Incident:</strong> Tic Tac-shaped craft targeted by a Hellfire missile</li>
<li><strong>Distance of Mars from Earth in 1877:</strong> 56 million kilometres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2017, The New York Times began publishing investigative reports about the AATIP, revealing its long-standing efforts to study UFOs. By early 2020s, numerous videos and images had surfaced, many of which remain unexplained. In January 2015, a pilot from the USS Theodore Roosevelt recorded a video of a UAP off the coast of Florida. In 2025, Congress received further video evidence showing a Tic Tac-shaped craft being engaged by a missile, which reportedly failed to impact the target.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The evidence of unidentified aerial phenomena has raised questions about national security and the potential for extraterrestrial technology,” said a military official familiar with the AATIP findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the recent revelations, discussions of UFOs were often relegated to the realm of conspiracy theories and science fiction. The historical context includes the 19th-century observations of Mars, where astronomers mistakenly believed they had found evidence of alien life. This has shaped public perception of extraterrestrial encounters and their implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the AATIP findings are ongoing, with Congress expected to continue reviewing the implications of these phenomena on national security and public awareness. Further disclosures from military sources may also emerge as interest in the topic grows.</p>
