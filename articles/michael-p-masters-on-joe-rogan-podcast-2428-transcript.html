      <h2>Michael P. Masters Discusses UFOs on Joe Rogan Podcast</h2>

<p>Biological anthropologist Michael P. Masters has appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, episode #2428, on December 18, 2025, where he presented his theory that some UFOs and aliens may be future humans traveling back in time. The conversation, which lasted over two hours, explored various aspects of UFO phenomena, including abduction accounts and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sightings.</p>

<p>This discussion is significant as it touches on ongoing public interest in UFOs and the implications of potential time travel, suggesting a new perspective on extraterrestrial encounters. Authorities and scientists have increasingly focused on UAPs, with recent disclosures prompting calls for greater transparency regarding UFO information.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the podcast, Masters outlined his theory about UFOs and their connection to human evolution.

They highlighted the reluctance of authorities to disclose such information due to concerns about societal reactions.</p>
