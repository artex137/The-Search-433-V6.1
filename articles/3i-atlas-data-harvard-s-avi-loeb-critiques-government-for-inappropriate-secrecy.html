      <h2>3I/ATLAS Data: Harvard's Avi Loeb Critiques Government For 'Inappropriate' Secrecy</h2>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has criticized the U.S. government for its handling of information regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS during an appearance on The Chris Cuomo Project on December 9, 2025. Loeb argues that intelligence agencies are obstructing scientific understanding by keeping findings about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) secretive.</p>

<p>Loeb's concerns highlight the tension between national security protocols and scientific transparency. He asserts that while security measures are necessary for terrestrial threats, they should not extend to objects originating from outside the solar system. Loeb believes that the government’s reluctance to collaborate with scientific experts undermines the pursuit of knowledge about cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb appeared on The Chris Cuomo Project on December 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is projected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object will be approximately 168 million miles away during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>Loeb has established the Galileo Project, which includes three observatories, with the latest located in Las Vegas.</li>
    <li>Loeb emphasizes that he intends to observe millions of objects using advanced machine learning software.</li>
    <li>The estimated annual military budget of the U.S. is roughly £780 billion ($1 trillion).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 9, 2025, Avi Loeb discussed the government's treatment of space data on The Chris Cuomo Project, expressing his concerns about the secrecy surrounding UAPs. He criticized the government for failing to collaborate with scientists on data concerning objects like 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>Loeb revealed the establishment of the Galileo Project, which aims to collect unclassified data using a network of private observatories. He mentioned that the latest observatory is located in Las Vegas, allowing for independent monitoring of the sky.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to come closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 168 million miles, prompting Loeb to advocate for more serious investigation of its anomalies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They should focus on national security,” Loeb asserted, emphasizing the distinction between protecting borders and exploring the galaxy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Because if there are [outliers], we can analyse them in a scientific way, inform everyone, it will not be a secret, it will not be classified,” he stated regarding the Galileo Project's approach.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb described the situation as “embarrassing,” particularly given the massive financial investment in defense.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's critique reflects a broader debate about the balance between national security and scientific inquiry. He argues that the government’s classification of UAP data often serves to conceal institutional shortcomings rather than to protect state secrets. This criticism comes amid increasing interest in UAPs and the need for transparency in scientific research.</p>

<p>Loeb believes that a significant shift in space funding might occur if undeniable evidence of “alien technology” were discovered, potentially uniting global efforts for space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb plans to continue his work with the Galileo Project, aiming to gather and analyze data on millions of objects in space. He hopes to promote transparency in the study of UAPs and advocate for increased collaboration between government agencies and scientific communities.</p>
