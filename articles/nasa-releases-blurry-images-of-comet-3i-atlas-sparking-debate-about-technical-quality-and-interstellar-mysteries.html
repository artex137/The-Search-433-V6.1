      <h2>NASA releases blurry images of comet 3I/ATLAS, sparking debate about technical quality and interstellar mysteries</h2>

<p>NASA has released images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS captured by the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on November 30, 2025, at the Goddard Space Flight Center. The event has generated significant disappointment among researchers and skywatchers due to the low quality of the photographs.</p>

<p>This release was intended to provide initial scientific data on the comet, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet is notable for its unique hyperbolic trajectory and atypical chemical composition, but the poor quality of the images has raised questions about NASA's equipment and transparency regarding the comet's features.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of image release:</strong> November 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Comet speed:</strong> 26 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Distance of activity detection:</strong> Between 3.5 and 6.5 astronomical units from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Rich in carbon dioxide, with traces of water ice, carbon monoxide, and carbonyl sulfide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2025, preliminary observations revealed a marginal coma and tail elongation of comet 3I/ATLAS. The official discovery occurred on July 1, 2025, through alerts from the ATLAS system. NASA released images on November 30, 2025, after a government shutdown delayed the processing of the data.</p>
<p>During the live event, NASA officials focused on explaining the compromised visual quality of the images rather than the anticipated findings from the comet's analysis. Tom Statler, chief small-body scientist at NASA, defended the images as serving spectral analysis rather than visual clarity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The main function of the images was to serve spectral analysis rather than visual aesthetics,” said Tom Statler, chief small-body scientist at NASA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn global attention since its discovery, primarily due to its unusual activity and composition. Unlike typical comets, which become active close to the Sun, 3I/ATLAS exhibited activity at much greater distances. This has led to intense scrutiny and debate regarding its origins and behavior.</p>
<p>Amateur astronomers have reportedly captured clearer images of the comet using lower-cost equipment, further fueling discussions about the quality of NASA's images and the importance of public accessibility in scientific data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has recognized the contributions of citizen scientists and is integrating their observations into global databases. Further analysis of comet 3I/ATLAS is expected as researchers continue to investigate its anomalies and unique characteristics.</p>
