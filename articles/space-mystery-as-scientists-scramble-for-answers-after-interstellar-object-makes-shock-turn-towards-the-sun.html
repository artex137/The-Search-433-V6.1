      <h2>Space mystery as scientists scramble for answers after 'interstellar object' makes shock turn towards the sun</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed unusual behavior from the interstellar object known as 3I, which is making a surprising turn towards the sun. This phenomenon was detected in August using the Two-Metre Twin Telescope located in the Canary Islands.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about comet behavior. Researchers are currently analyzing the data to understand the implications of this unexpected trajectory and the object's unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I</li>
    <li>Observation date: August 2023</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Two-Metre Twin Telescope, Canary Islands</li>
    <li>Distance of gas and dust jet: approximately 3.7 miles from the core</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2023, scientists captured images of 3I using the Two-Metre Twin Telescope in the Canary Islands. The images revealed a faint jet of gas and dust extending from the comet's core.</p>
<p>This unexpected behavior has prompted researchers to investigate the object's trajectory and its potential implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have never seen a comet behave this way before,” said a lead researcher involved in the study. “This raises many questions about the nature of interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident marks a rare observation of an interstellar object, which are typically difficult to study due to their fleeting presence in the solar system. Previous interstellar objects, like ‘Oumuamua, have also sparked significant scientific discussion but exhibited different characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from the telescope to gain further insights into 3I's behavior and trajectory. Further observations may provide additional information about the object's composition and origin.</p>
