      <h2>Avi Loeb Warns Speed Boost on 3I/ATLAS Requires Vast Power — Unknown Force at Work?</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, suggesting its recent acceleration cannot be explained by known natural phenomena. Loeb's remarks, made during a Newsmax interview, indicate that the unexpected changes in the comet's trajectory follow its perihelion on 29 October. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this situation.</p>

<p>The implications of Loeb's findings are significant, as they prompt further investigation into the nature of 3I/ATLAS. The object is currently under congressional examination, with scientists monitoring its behaviors closely. The unexpected acceleration, described by Loeb as "clearly manoeuvred," raises questions about potential forces at play that remain unexplained by current astrophysics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was last observed near the Sun on 29 October.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has stated that the comet has exhibited acceleration not attributable to gravitational forces.</li>
    <li>The object's speed increase is likened to a jet carrying five billion tons of matter.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has displayed unique jets, with some extending nearly 3 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The comet became five times brighter and bluer than before its closest approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Loeb has indicated a 40% likelihood that the comet may have an artificial origin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first recognized as an interstellar visitor and entered the solar system on a hyperbolic trajectory. Following its perihelion on 29 October, the comet exhibited unexpected acceleration. Avi Loeb conducted a Newsmax interview where he discussed these observations and their implications, stating that the object deviated from its expected gravitational path.</p>

<p>Loeb noted the absence of a typical cometary tail, which would usually accompany such changes, and emphasized the significance of the jets observed around the object. The situation continues to develop as scientists prepare to analyze data from telescopes for further insights.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It clearly maneuvered,” Loeb said. “The increase in its speed was comparable to the thrust of a jet carrying five billion tons of matter.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It did get hotter, but it's still much cooler than the surface of the Sun, which is 5800 degrees,” Loeb explained. “We would expect it to be redder than the Sun. But it became bluer than the Sun, and the question is why — and that's not fully understood.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third recognized interstellar object to have passed through the solar system, following 'Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. Previous studies of these objects have raised questions about their origins and behaviors. Loeb's findings suggest that the dynamics of 3I/ATLAS could differ significantly from those of typical comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As scientists continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, further observations are expected in the coming days and weeks. The Galileo Project is preparing to analyze telescope data for any potential secondary objects released by the comet. Loeb has advised that the situation is evolving, and more insights will emerge as the object gets closer to Earth.</p>
