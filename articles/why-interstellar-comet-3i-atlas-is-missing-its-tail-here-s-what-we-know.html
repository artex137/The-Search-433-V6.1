      <h2>Why Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is 'Missing' Its Tail — Here's What We Know</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently moving away from the Sun, and have clarified that it has not lost its tail. The latest images were captured on November 5 by Qicheng Zhang at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it helps clarify misconceptions about the comet's appearance. Researchers are studying 3I/ATLAS, which is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System, to learn more about its composition and behavior as it travels deeper into space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed on November 5, 2023.</li>
    <li>Images were taken at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona.</li>
    <li>The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>It is thought to have originated from an unidentified stellar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS can be observed by telescopes worldwide and by amateur astronomers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 and has intrigued astronomers since then. It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2023, during which it was most active. Following this, Zhang captured its first optical images on October 31, observing it at dawn.</p>
<p>On November 5, the latest images revealed that, while the comet appeared brighter on one side, it did not exhibit a visible dust tail, leading to further analysis of its structure and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The comet contains many large hydrocarbons — molecules made of hydrogen and carbon — which break apart when exposed to ultraviolet light from the Sun," Zhang said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "It's an exciting opportunity. We can watch an interstellar visitor evolve in real time as it leaves our Solar System behind," Zhang added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third interstellar object confirmed to pass through our Solar System. Its study provides valuable insights into the chemical composition of comets and their behavior when interacting with solar radiation.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that 3I/ATLAS may have developed a thick, irradiated crust due to prolonged exposure to cosmic radiation, potentially altering the materials it releases as it travels.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will monitor its evolution and behavior. Increased visibility in the night sky will allow for more extensive observations by both professional and amateur astronomers.</p>
