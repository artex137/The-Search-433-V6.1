      <h2>When UFOs Swarmed Washington: Why America’s Oldest Aerial Mystery Is Back</h2>

<p>As pilots across the US report a steady rise in sightings of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), attention has returned to the dramatic events of July 1952 in Washington, DC. During this time, multiple radar operators detected unidentified objects moving erratically over the capital region, leading to heightened public concern and military response. No injuries or fatalities were reported during these incidents.</p>

<p>This resurgence of interest in UAPs is significant as it raises questions about national security, advanced technology, and unexplained objects in the sky. The US military has acknowledged the uptick in reports, with the Pentagon establishing the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dates: July 19–20, 1952, and July 26, 1952</li>
    <li>Location: Washington, DC, including Washington National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base</li>
    <li>Military response: Air Force scrambled interceptors on July 26, 1952</li>
    <li>Reported sightings: More than a dozen solid targets tracked across a 100-mile area</li>
    <li>Public response: Widespread panic and sensational headlines in newspapers</li>
    <li>Project Blue Book: Officially labeled the incidents as “unknown”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the night of July 19–20, 1952, radar operators at Washington National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base detected unidentified objects. These blips displayed erratic movements, including hovering and sudden direction changes. A nearby commercial airline pilot also reported seeing bright lights near his aircraft.</p>

<p>On July 26, 1952, radar operators tracked more than a dozen solid targets moving across a 100-mile area. Lieutenant William L. Patterson and Captain John McHugo were dispatched in F-94 fighter jets to investigate. Patterson reported seeing four bright lights that suddenly rushed toward his aircraft before vanishing. McHugo, in a different sector, saw nothing. This led to increased public alarm and media coverage, with newspapers declaring “SAUCERS SWARM OVER CAPITAL.”</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Those people have seen something.” - Albert Einstein</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Temperature inversions might explain about half of the sightings.” - Major General John Samford, Director of Intelligence</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Washington Flap marked a significant moment in the history of UFO sightings, as it demonstrated that unidentified objects could appear over one of the most secure airspaces in the United States. Following these events, the term “UFO” was eventually replaced by “UAP” to encompass a broader range of unexplained phenomena. The modern UFO era began in 1947, but the Washington incidents highlighted limitations in military detection and response capabilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAPs continue under the purview of the AARO, which currently receives 50 to 100 reports each month. While many of these cases are attributed to drones, balloons, or sensor errors, some remain unexplained, keeping the conversation about UAPs active and ongoing.</p>
