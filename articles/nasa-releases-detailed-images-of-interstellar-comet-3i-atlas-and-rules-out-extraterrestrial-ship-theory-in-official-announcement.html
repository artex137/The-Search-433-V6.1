      <h2>NASA releases detailed images of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas and rules out extraterrestrial ship theory in official announcement</h2>

<p>On Wednesday, November 19, 2025, NASA released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas during a press conference in Greenbelt, Maryland. The North American space agency confirmed that the comet, which originated outside the Solar System, displays typical cometary characteristics such as a coma and tail. NASA's announcement aims to clarify scientific data and address speculation regarding the comet's nature.</p>

<p>This announcement is significant as it dismisses theories suggesting that 3I/Atlas may be an artificial object. NASA has emphasized that the comet poses no risk to Earth, as it will pass at a minimum distance of 275 million kilometers in December. Astronomers have been monitoring the comet's trajectory since its discovery, gathering important data about its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of announcement: November 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Initial detection: July 1, 2025, by an ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Speed of comet: over 240,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 275 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated age of comet: greater than 8 billion years</li>
    <li>Mass loss: approximately 150 kilograms per second</li>
    <li>Core diameter: approximately 1 kilometer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first detected on July 1, 2025, by an ATLAS system telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicated that it originates from outside the Solar System. Observations continued through September, when the comet passed close to Mars, allowing for preliminary data collection.</p>

<p>In October, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured high-resolution images, revealing details of the comet's coma. The comet reached perihelion in October, releasing material that formed its elongated tail. By November, telescopes in various locations, including Puerto Rico and Austria, captured sharp images showing the expanding coma and tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, associate administrator of NASA, stated, “All evidence points to a natural comet. The object exhibits predicted behavior, such as gas ejection as it approaches the Sun, with no signs of technology.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nicola Fox from NASA's Directorate of Scientific Missions highlighted, “There are no technosignatures on more than 20 observation platforms.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This announcement follows prior incidents of speculation regarding interstellar objects, including 2017's 1I/’Oumuamua and 2019's 2I/Borisov. NASA has been actively monitoring for signs of life in the universe but confirmed that 3I/Atlas does not fit into this category. The agency's ongoing observations aim to enhance understanding of the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches its closest point to Earth and moves beyond Jupiter in 2026. Ongoing observations will refine the comet's orbit and provide more insights into its composition and characteristics.</p>
