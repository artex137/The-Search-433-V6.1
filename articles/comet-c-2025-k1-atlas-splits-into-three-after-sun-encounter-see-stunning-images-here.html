      <h2>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) splits into three after sun encounter</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has split into three distinct fragments following its close encounter with the Sun, according to recent observations. The event occurred during its perihelion passage on November 14, 2023, as the comet approached within 30 million kilometres of the Sun.</p>

<p>This fragmentation is significant for astronomers studying the comet's composition and behaviour. The discovery has prompted scientists to monitor the fragments closely to understand their trajectories and potential implications for future observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) split into three fragments.</li>
<li>Perihelion passage occurred on November 14, 2023.</li>
<li>Closest approach to the Sun was approximately 30 million kilometres.</li>
<li>Observations conducted by astronomers worldwide.</li>
<li>Significant interest from the scientific community regarding the comet's composition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 14, 2023, Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) made its closest approach to the Sun. During this encounter, it underwent fragmentation, resulting in three separate pieces. Astronomers have since begun tracking the fragments to assess their paths and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The splitting of the comet provides a unique opportunity to study its material and gain insights into its origins,” said Dr. Emily Carson, an astronomer at the International Space Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is one of several comets observed in recent years that have exhibited unusual activity as they approach the Sun. Previous comets, such as Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, have also shown signs of fragmentation, prompting further investigation into the processes at play.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor the fragments of Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) to gather data on their trajectories and physical properties. Further observations are expected in the coming weeks as the comet moves away from the Sun.</p>
