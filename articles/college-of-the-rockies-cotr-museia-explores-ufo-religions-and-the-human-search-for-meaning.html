<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 17, 2023, Dr. C. Shaun Longstreet will present his lecture at the College of the Rockies. He will discuss how UFO religions serve as a framework for understanding human existence, particularly during times of societal uncertainty.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We'll explore UFO religions - from Raëism to Heaven's Gate - not as curiosities to dismiss, but as windows into how people construct meaning, identity, and hope in modern life,” Longstreet said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Extraordinary beliefs often reflect very ordinary human needs, reminding us that the search for meaning is something we all share,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO religions have gained attention as contemporary movements that provide followers with a sense of purpose and identity. Historical examples illustrate how religious narratives often emerge during periods of crisis, offering adherents a way to make sense of their experiences and the world around them.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
