      <h2>Organic Molecules Confirmed On 3I/ATLAS As Interstellar Object Approaches Jupiter</h2>

<p>NASA’s SPHEREx telescope has confirmed the presence of organic molecules emanating from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach to Earth in December 2025. The findings were published in the February issue of the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for the scientific community as it suggests that organic compounds may be more common in the universe than previously thought. Researchers are continuing to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, where its trajectory may provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery date: December 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Research published in: February 2026 issue of Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society</li>
    <li>Telescope used: NASA’s SPHEREx</li>
    <li>Type of molecules detected: Carbon-based organic compounds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, NASA’s SPHEREx telescope detected organic molecules from 3I/ATLAS during its close pass by Earth. The findings were reported in a preliminary format, indicating ongoing research. As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, astronomers expect to gather more data regarding the object's behavior and composition.</p>

<p>The object is scheduled for its closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, which will be a critical moment for further observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection is an important chemical finding that warrants continued observation and verification,” NASA researchers said regarding the organic compounds detected.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb stated that the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS could create a natural dispersal event within the Jovian system, enhancing the spread of organic materials.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of a few interstellar objects observed in recent years, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, each of which exhibited different characteristics. The current observations of 3I/ATLAS provide a unique opportunity to study how interstellar bodies behave under the gravitational influence of a planet.</p>

<p>The presence of organic molecules on 3I/ATLAS raises questions about the chemical universality of life’s building blocks across the universe, suggesting that such compounds may not be confined to our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, scientists will utilize telescopes on Earth and in orbit to gather more data. Observations during and after the encounter will refine current interpretations and may reveal more about the composition and behavior of interstellar objects.</p>
