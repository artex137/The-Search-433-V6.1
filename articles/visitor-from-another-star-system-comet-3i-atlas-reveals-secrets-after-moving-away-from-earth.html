      <h2>Visitor from another star system, comet 3I/ATLAS, reveals secrets after moving away from Earth</h2>

<p>Astronomers have monitored comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object, as it moves away from Earth following its closest approach on December 19, 2025. The comet passed at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides valuable data on the composition of distant planetary systems. Space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are analyzing the information collected to understand better the formation of planetary bodies in other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Passed at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Current speed is around 64 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Visible in the constellation of Leão with an apparent magnitude of around 13.</li>
    <li>Analysis conducted by NASA and ESA continues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025. Following its identification, astronomers confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is an interstellar visitor. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and has since begun its journey back into deep space.</p>

<p>In early 2026, the comet is still being observed as it moves rapidly toward the outer reaches of the Solar System, with ongoing analysis of its chemical composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The data collected from 3I/ATLAS offers a unique window into the materials that formed planets around another star,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “This is an unprecedented opportunity for planetary science.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the earlier discoveries of interstellar objects 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These findings suggest that the passage of such objects through our Solar System is more common than previously thought, providing scientists with a growing statistical sample for studying the diversity of small bodies in our galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing analysis of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue for years, as scientists aim to decipher the composition of primordial materials that formed planets in its home star system. This research may help determine whether planetary formation processes are universal or vary significantly across different star systems.</p>
