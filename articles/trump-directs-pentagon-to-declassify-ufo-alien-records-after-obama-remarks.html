      <h2>Trump directs Pentagon to declassify UFO, alien records after Obama remarks</h2>

<p>US President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon and federal agencies to release government files on UFOs and extraterrestrial life, following comments made by former President Barack Obama. The directive was issued on Thursday via a post on Truth Social.</p>

<p>This action reflects Trump's response to public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and recent statements by Obama, who suggested that aliens are "real" during a podcast. Trump’s order aims to identify and disclose all relevant documents related to UFOs and Area 51, which he described as "highly complex, but extremely interesting and important."</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump issued the directive on Thursday via Truth Social.</li>
    <li>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is tasked with implementing the order.</li>
    <li>Obama stated he saw no evidence of extraterrestrial contact during his presidency.</li>
    <li>A 2024 Pentagon report found no proof of extraterrestrial involvement in UAP sightings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Trump directed the Pentagon to release files on UFOs and related phenomena. This followed Obama's remarks on a podcast where he acknowledged the public's curiosity about extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Trump claimed that Obama revealed classified information and suggested he might "get him out of trouble" by declassifying the relevant documents. Obama later clarified his stance on social media, stating he had seen no evidence supporting claims of extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Made a big mistake. I may get him out of trouble by declassifying,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Obama clarified via social media that he attributed his view on extraterrestrial life to the vastness of the universe.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Public interest in UFOs has surged in recent years, particularly following various government reports and investigations into UAP sightings. The Pentagon's 2024 report indicated ongoing inquiries but concluded there was no evidence linking these phenomena to extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Trump's directive marks a significant move in the ongoing dialogue about government transparency regarding UFOs and has the potential to shape future discussions on the topic.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Pentagon will begin identifying and disclosing documents related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life as per Trump's order. Further updates on the content of these files and any potential implications are expected in the coming weeks.</p>
