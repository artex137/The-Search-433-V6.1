      <h2>People think China 'intercepted a meteor or UFO' after fireball video goes viral</h2>

<p>A video of a bright fireball streaking across the sky above Shandong province in China on Friday has gone viral, leading to speculation about its nature. No injuries or fatalities have been reported following the incident.</p>

<p>The incident has attracted significant attention on social media, with many users suggesting the fireball may have been a meteor or even a UFO that was "shot down." Authorities have not confirmed the cause of the event, and investigations are ongoing to clarify what occurred.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on Friday in Shandong province, China.</li>
    <li>Multiple witnesses reported seeing a bright object and hearing loud bangs.</li>
    <li>Local emergency management officials have not reported any accidents in the area.</li>
    <li>Weather conditions included drizzle, which may have contributed to initial confusion.</li>
    <li>Live-fire training was being conducted off Weifang Port at the time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Friday, witnesses in Shandong province observed a bright fireball in the sky. Reports indicate that some individuals heard two loud bangs, leading to speculation about the object’s nature. Videos of the incident quickly spread on social media, prompting various theories.</p>
<p>Chinese media reported that the weather was drizzly that night, causing some to mistake the sounds for thunder. Others speculated about possible factory explosions or military activities nearby.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I heard two loud bangs and it was raining, so I thought it was thunder,” a witness told the Chinese news outlet First Scene.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The problem is that it partly looks like a meteor until it doesn’t. That’s why I’m sceptical,” said Dr Alfredo Carpineti, an astrophysicist.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We believe that a lot of their so-called civilian space programme is a military programme,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson regarding China's space efforts.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident occurs amid growing concerns over China's advancements in space technology. In recent years, China has invested heavily in its space program, raising questions about its true intentions. In 2024, NASA warned that China may attempt to claim parts of the Moon in the near future.</p>
<p>Experts have noted the challenges in determining the nature of the object observed in Shandong, as meteors enter the atmosphere at extremely high velocities, making interception without prior tracking nearly impossible.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating the incident to determine its cause. As of now, no further information has been disclosed by local officials or emergency management agencies.
