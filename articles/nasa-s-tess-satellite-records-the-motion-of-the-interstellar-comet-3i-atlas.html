      <h2>NASA's TESS Satellite Records the Motion of the Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's TESS satellite has observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from January 15 to 22, 2023, providing new insights into its activity and rotation. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this event.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it allows scientists to study the comet's behavior and characteristics. According to Daniel Muthukrishna from MIT, the data has been compiled into a short video that shows 3I/ATLAS moving with its comet tail. The findings have been made publicly available through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation period: January 15 to 22, 2023</li>
    <li>Brightness level of 3I/ATLAS: magnitude 11.5</li>
    <li>Brightness comparison: 100 times weaker than naked-eye visibility</li>
    <li>Data accessible to the public via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes</li>
    <li>TESS previously captured 3I/ATLAS in May 2025 before its official discovery</li>
    <li>TESS experienced a three-day technical halt due to solar panel issues</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's TESS satellite has been monitoring 3I/ATLAS, with a significant observation occurring from January 15 to 22, 2023. During this period, scientists compiled images into a video showing the comet's movement. In May 2025, TESS had previously captured an image of 3I/ATLAS before it was officially discovered.</p>

<p>During the observation, TESS encountered technical problems, leading to a temporary halt for three days. The satellite entered safe mode due to issues with its solar panel but was successfully restored by NASA technicians.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The TESS satellite is designed to search for exoplanets by scanning the light variations of distant stars. This technique has proven to be very effective for monitoring the movement of comets and asteroids at very long distances,” said Daniel Muthukrishna from MIT.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS contributes to a growing body of research on interstellar objects. TESS's ability to monitor such distant phenomena emphasizes the advancements in space observation technology. Prior to this, the discovery of comets and asteroids relied heavily on ground-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data from the recent observations will be available for astronomers to analyze further. There are no current investigations or charges related to this observation, and the next steps involve ongoing monitoring of 3I/ATLAS and other celestial bodies.</p>
