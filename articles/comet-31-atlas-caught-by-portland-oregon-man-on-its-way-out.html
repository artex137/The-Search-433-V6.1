      <h2>Comet 31/Atlas Caught By Portland, Oregon Man On Its Way Out</h2>

<p>A Portland, Oregon man has captured an image of comet 3I/ATLAS as it exits the solar system, according to reports published on January 3, 2026. Patrick Finney took the photograph from his backyard at the beginning of the new year, shortly after the comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third extra-solar visitor recorded in our solar system. NASA scientists have monitored the comet since its discovery earlier in the summer, and its current trajectory indicates it is moving away from the Sun and will eventually exit the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million km (1.8 AU).</li>
    <li>Discovered by NASA's ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Finney used a ZWO SeeStar S50 smart telescope to capture the image.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently exhibiting expected behavior as it moves away from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The timeline of events surrounding comet 3I/ATLAS is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Summer 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered by NASA through the ATLAS survey telescope.</li>
    <li>December 19, 2025: The comet reaches its closest approach to Earth.</li>
    <li>January 1, 2026: Patrick Finney captures an image of the comet from his backyard in Portland.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third object in history from outside of our solar system to be discovered within our solar system,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is a smart telescope, meaning it has GPS tracking, and can find the object you want to see,” Finney explained. “It also has edit features and filtering, to enhance imagery.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third extra-solar comet identified in our solar system, following a trend of increasing discoveries of interstellar objects. The comet’s visibility has largely depended on the use of advanced telescopes, as it has not been observable to the naked eye from regions like the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, NASA scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and characteristics, documenting its behavior as it exits the gravitational influence of the Sun.</p>
