      <h2>Mysterious interstellar object leaves scientists baffled with bizarre new behaviour</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual behaviour as it passes through our solar system, raising questions among scientists. The comet, which is currently around 130 million miles from the Sun, is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, at approximately 170 million miles away.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it could provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS may represent something beyond a typical comet. He has criticized NASA for not fully investigating the object's potential, stating that it could even be an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: approximately 130 million miles</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, around 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Notable behaviour: unusual acceleration and blue hue</li>
    <li>NASA's statement: confirmed it is the third interstellar comet in the solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recently, 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of accelerating unexpectedly. Loeb noted that the object appeared bluer than previous observations indicated, which he described as a "ninth anomaly." NASA has also confirmed that the object has unusual acceleration, which may be a result of typical comet outgassing.</p>

<p>Loeb has requested images from NASA, which he claims have not been released. He speculates that if no massive gas cloud is observed around 3I/ATLAS by December, it could suggest the presence of a propulsion system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "NASA's observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system," said NASA's Acting Administrator Sean Duffy. He added, "there will be no aliens" and that the comet poses "no threat" to life on Earth.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time interstellar objects have sparked debate among scientists. Previous instances, such as 'Oumuamua, have led to discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretations of these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observations on December 19 will be crucial in determining if the object behaves like a typical comet or if it exhibits characteristics that warrant further investigation.</p>
