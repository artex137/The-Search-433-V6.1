      <h2>Soviet troops 'turned to stone by aliens' after shooting down UFO</h2>

<p>In 1993, a bizarre incident in Siberia involved Soviet troops allegedly turning to stone after encountering an alien spacecraft, according to a report from that era. The incident reportedly occurred when military forces shot down a UFO using a surface-to-air missile, resulting in 23 soldiers being petrified, with only a few survivors left to tell the tale.</p>

<p>This account has raised questions regarding the existence of advanced alien technology and its potential implications. Authorities have not confirmed the details of the incident, but the story has re-emerged in public discussion following the release of previously classified documents, including a CIA file that references the event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Incident occurred in 1993 in Siberia, former Soviet Union.</li>
<li>23 soldiers were allegedly turned to stone; only a handful survived.</li>
<li>Five extraterrestrial entities reportedly emerged from the wreckage.</li>
<li>UFO was shot down by a surface-to-air missile.</li>
<li>Wreckage and petrified soldiers were taken to a classified facility near Moscow.</li>
<li>Analysis suggested soldiers had transformed into a material matching limestone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1993, Soviet military forces engaged a UFO over Siberia using a surface-to-air missile. Following the missile strike, five beings emerged from the wreckage and merged into a radiant sphere. Witnesses reported that the sphere emitted a beam of light, instantly petrifying 23 soldiers during the event.</p>

<p>Only two soldiers reportedly survived due to their lesser exposure to the phenomenon. The incident was documented in a Ukrainian newspaper and mentioned in a now-declassified CIA file, which acknowledged the account but did not confirm its authenticity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The CIA document merely reproduces the 1993 Ukrainian piece and forms no part of an official investigation confirming its authenticity,” a spokesperson stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, the Soviet Union dismissed UFO sightings as Western propaganda. However, newly disclosed documents indicate that Soviet institutions were actively monitoring and documenting unusual aerial phenomena during the 1970s and 1980s. These records included a notable entry from February 13, 1989, detailing a massive airborne object observed over Nalchik, Russia.</p>

<p>The most notorious incident involved a low-flying disc-shaped vessel appearing above military personnel during training exercises, leading to the events of 1993. This has contributed to ongoing speculation about the government's handling of UFO sightings and extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigation into the incident is not disclosed. Authorities have not indicated any plans for new inquiries or confirmations regarding the authenticity of the reports.</p>
