      <h2>Have Comet Sense: Harvard Astronomer’s Alien Hypothesis Gets A Comeback From NASA</h2>

<p>Nasa scientists have dismissed claims by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb that Comet 3I/Atlas, discovered on July 1 in Río Hurtado, could be an alien probe with potentially dire consequences for Earth. The comet is expected to pass close to Mars next month.</p>

<p>This debate matters as it highlights differing views on the origins of interstellar objects and the implications for humanity. Nasa has been tracking Comet 3I/Atlas with various telescopes, asserting that it behaves like a typical comet and poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas discovered on July 1, 2023, by the Atlas survey telescope.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>Expected to pass near Mars in October 2023.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb suggested it may be a "technological artifact" with a velocity of 130,000 mph (209,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Nasa has tracked the comet using Hubble and other telescopes since its discovery.</li>
    <li>Nasa states the comet will not come closer than about 170 million miles to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the Atlas survey telescope discovered Comet 3I/Atlas. Since then, Nasa has actively monitored the comet's trajectory and behavior. In a recent paper, Avi Loeb proposed that the comet could be of alien origin due to its unusual characteristics.</p>
<p>In response, Nasa scientists have reiterated that the comet displays typical comet behavior and characteristics, emphasizing its natural origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know.” 
    <strong>— Tom Statler, Nasa’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity.” 
    <strong>— Avi Loeb, head of Harvard University’s Galileo Project</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects like Comet 3I/Atlas has become increasingly common, with only three known to have entered the solar system. This marks a significant opportunity for scientists to study the composition of other solar systems.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb's hypothesis has sparked discussion within the scientific community about the need for open-mindedness in exploring unconventional ideas.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches Mars and will provide updates on its trajectory and characteristics as necessary.</p>
