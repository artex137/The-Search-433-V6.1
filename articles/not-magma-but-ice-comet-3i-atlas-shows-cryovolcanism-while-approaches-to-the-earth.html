      <h2>Not magma, but ice — Comet 3I/Atlas shows "cryovolcanism" while approaches to the Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has exhibited cryovolcanism as it approaches the Earth, revealing jets of frost and vapour instead of magma, according to NASA and researchers at Lowell Observatory. The comet, discovered in July 2025, is currently passing through the solar system on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating that it will not return.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges previous understandings of comet activity. Researchers have noted that Comet 3I/Atlas contains both ice and magma-like characteristics, suggesting that icy comets can erupt similarly to volcanoes. This finding provides insight into the formation of different planetary systems and the behavior of ancient interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025.</li>
<li>The comet is the third known interstellar visitor carrying ancient material older than the Sun.</li>
<li>It is currently on a hyperbolic path through the solar system.</li>
<li>The comet has exhibited cryovolcanism, expelling jets of gas, vaporized metal, and icy particles.</li>
<li>Researchers have observed an “anti-tail” that points in the direction the comet is moving.</li>
<li>The comet is rich in carbon dioxide, ice, and other metal gases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025. Since then, researchers have studied its unique characteristics as it passes through the solar system. The comet has displayed cryovolcanic activity, attributed to the Sun's heat causing the carbonated icy layer to sublimate, resulting in powerful eruptions.</p>

<p>In recent observations, scientists noted that the comet's surface layer may have fractured, leading to significant outflows of gases and icy particles. This activity has provided new insights into the processes that govern the behavior of comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This discovery reveals that cryovolcanism is not limited to icy moons and can occur on small, ancient interstellar bodies like Comet 3I/Atlas,” said Qicheng Zhang, a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior research has primarily focused on comets displaying typical characteristics of ice, dust, and rock. The findings regarding Comet 3I/Atlas expand the understanding of cometary activity and suggest that similar processes may occur in other icy bodies across the galaxy. This research contributes to a broader understanding of the evolution and formation of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study Comet 3I/Atlas as it passes through the solar system. Observations made during this unique event are expected to enhance knowledge about cometary behavior and planetary formation processes.</p>
