      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Hits Solar Conjunction And Perihelion, A Key Test For “Alien Mothership” Hypothesis</h2>

<p>The interstellar object designated 3I/ATLAS has reached solar conjunction on October 21 and will reach perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on October 29. Discovered on July 1 by astronomers with the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it tests competing theories regarding the origins of 3I/ATLAS. While most scientists classify it as a natural comet, Harvard astronomy professor Avi Loeb has proposed that it may have technological origins. Observations during perihelion may provide critical data on the object's behavior and composition, which could clarify its nature and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Solar Conjunction:</strong> October 21, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Sun at Outgassing:</strong> 6.4 astronomical units</li>
    <li><strong>Research Institutions:</strong> Harvard University, NASA, SETI</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by astronomers using the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The object has exhibited unusual features, including a distinct chemical composition and an anti-tail phenomenon. It reached solar conjunction on October 21, 2023, and will reach perihelion on October 29, 2023.</p>
<p>During perihelion, scientists expect increased outgassing due to solar heating, which could provide valuable data about the comet’s composition. Observations from Mars orbiters and Jupiter-orbiting spacecraft will be critical during this period, as Earth-based telescopes will not be able to view the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, Harvard astronomy professor, stated, “There is a 30 to 40 percent probability that 3I/ATLAS might not possess fully natural origins.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies, emphasized, “The object behaves exactly like comets we already understand.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows two previous interstellar objects, 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have also sparked interest in the scientific community. The debate over the nature of 3I/ATLAS has brought attention to the potential for technological interventions in celestial objects, though the majority of scientists support natural explanations for its observed phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following perihelion, scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to determine whether it maintains its expected hyperbolic trajectory or exhibits deviations that could support alternative hypotheses. Observations during this period are crucial for confirming its classification as a natural comet.</p>
