      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Hits Solar Conjunction And Perihelion, A Key Test For "Alien Mothership" Hypothesis</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reached solar conjunction and perihelion, with its closest approach to the Sun occurring on October 29. The object, discovered by astronomers from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, is currently positioned behind the Sun, making it difficult to observe from Earth. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it tests the controversial "alien mothership" hypothesis proposed by Harvard professor Avi Loeb. He suggests that if 3I/ATLAS is not of natural origin, it may perform unusual maneuvers during its perihelion approach. Observations from Mars orbiters and potentially from Jupiter's orbit may provide insights into the object's characteristics, despite Earth-based telescopes being unable to view it at this time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Solar conjunction occurs on October 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, is on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object is currently 6.4 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>One AU is the distance between the Earth and the Sun, approximately 149.6 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb estimates a 30–40% chance that the object is not of natural origin.</li>
    <li>The object's speed at perihelion is approximately 68 kilometers per second.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers from ATLAS discovered the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Following its identification, it was confirmed as a comet with unique chemical properties and an unusual anti-tail. The object is now positioned behind the Sun and will be at solar conjunction on October 21, 2023. Perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, is set for October 29, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for Solar System small bodies.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If you want to take a vacation, take it before [October 29], because who knows what will happen?” said Avi Loeb regarding the potential for unexpected maneuvers by the comet.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS marks the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous observations of such objects have led to extensive studies regarding their origins and behaviors. The scientific community has largely dismissed claims of extraterrestrial technology associated with these comets, favoring natural explanations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After perihelion, scientists will monitor 3I/ATLAS for any unexpected changes in its trajectory. Observations from Mars orbiters may provide data that could confirm or refute the alien mothership hypothesis. If the object continues on its predicted path, it will exit the Solar System, and the hypothesis will likely be disregarded.</p>
