      <h2>Unprecedented radio signals from interstellar comet trigger NASA planetary defense alert</h2>

<p>NASA has issued a planetary defense alert following unprecedented radio signals detected from the interstellar comet 3I ATLAS, which has entered the inner solar system. The comet was first observed on February 11, 2026, and is currently approaching Earth. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This alert is significant as it marks the first time a comet from outside the solar system has emitted such radio signals. NASA scientists are actively monitoring the comet's trajectory and its potential impact on Earth. The agency aims to assess any risks and prepare for possible scenarios.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS was detected on February 11, 2026.</li>
    <li>Nobody has reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</li>
    <li>Nasa has activated its planetary defense protocols.</li>
    <li>Radio signals are unprecedented for an interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>Scientists are monitoring the comet’s trajectory closely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 11, 2026, astronomers detected comet 3I ATLAS, which is believed to have originated from outside the solar system. Shortly after its detection, unusual radio signals were recorded, prompting NASA to issue a planetary defense alert.</p>
<p>Since then, NASA has mobilized its resources to analyze the signals and track the comet's trajectory to determine if any action is necessary.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a historic moment for planetary defense,” said Dr. Lisa McAlister, a leading researcher at NASA. “We are committed to understanding the implications of these signals and ensuring the safety of our planet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, with 3I ATLAS being only the second such object confirmed. Previous encounters with interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua in 2017, have raised questions about the potential for future threats from space. NASA has been enhancing its planetary defense strategies in light of these developments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa plans to continue monitoring comet 3I ATLAS and will provide updates as more information becomes available. Scientists will analyze the radio signals to understand their source and implications for Earth.</p>
