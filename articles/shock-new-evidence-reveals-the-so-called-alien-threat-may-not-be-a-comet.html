      <h2>Shock new evidence reveals the so-called ‘alien threat’ may not be a comet</h2>

<p>New evidence has emerged regarding the object 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may not be a comet as previously believed. The object has recently passed behind the Sun, prompting renewed speculation about its true nature. Authorities, including NASA and other scientists, have maintained their stance that 3I/ATLAS is simply a comet from outside the solar system.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it raises questions about the object's properties, which some believe may indicate it is an alien vessel rather than a comet. Scientists are now preparing for further investigation to determine the true nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object 3I/ATLAS has emerged from behind the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA and other scientists assert it is a comet.</li>
    <li>New observations show 3I/ATLAS remains intact after perihelion passage.</li>
    <li>Data indicates no debris or fragments have been detected.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, advocates for cautious approaches regarding potential alien technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an object entering our solar system. Following its recent perihelion passage, it was observed emerging from behind the Sun. Initial reports suggested it behaved as a typical comet, but new findings have led to speculation about its composition and purpose.</p>

<p>On November 14, 2025, astronomers David Jewitt and Jane Luu reported that 3I/ATLAS remains a single, intact body. Further observations are expected in early December, which may clarify its status.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS continues as an active, single body, with no evidence for breakup following the recent perihelion passage,” said astronomers David Jewitt and Jane Luu.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I believe that we need an international organization that will make policy decisions about such an object,” stated Avi Loeb, stressing the need for caution regarding potential alien technology.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The emergence of 3I/ATLAS has drawn comparisons to previous unidentified objects that have passed through the solar system. The debate surrounding its nature has reignited discussions about the potential existence of extraterrestrial technology and the need for international protocols in monitoring such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS in early December, which may provide clarity on its characteristics and address the ongoing speculation regarding its nature.</p>
