      <h2>SPHEREx Maps the Carbon Dioxide Breath of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers in Chile discovered Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. The comet is currently about 290 million miles (470 million kilometers) from the Sun. SPHEREx, a NASA mission, captured detailed infrared observations of the comet from August 8 to 12, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the composition and formation of celestial bodies from outside our solar system. Scientists are using the data collected by SPHEREx to understand how materials around other stars may evolve and how they differ from comets formed in our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: approximately 290 million miles (470 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>SPHEREx observations conducted from August 8 to 12, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet's coma extends at least 348,000 kilometers.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx detected water in the nucleus, but not in the coma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers in Chile identified Comet 3I/ATLAS as it traveled through the outer solar system. Following its discovery, SPHEREx initiated observations between August 8 and 12, 2025, capturing a unique infrared portrait of the comet's composition.</p>

<p>During these observations, SPHEREx revealed a bright, extended cloud of carbon dioxide gas surrounding the comet, which is rare for a comet in our solar system. The data indicated that carbon dioxide, rather than water vapor, dominates the outgassing from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Understanding 3I/ATLAS helps astronomers sample the chemistry of other star systems,” said a NASA representative. “Each interstellar visitor offers a unique glimpse into planetary formation beyond our Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects, ʻOumuamua and Borisov, had been confirmed. The study of these comets has led to new insights about the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>The observations from SPHEREx challenge existing assumptions about comet composition, particularly the idea that water-dominated comets are the norm. Instead, 3I/ATLAS suggests a different chemical configuration that may reflect its unique formation environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and global teams will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. Scientists aim to gather further data until solar radiation diminishes its output or the comet becomes obscured by the Sun.</p>
