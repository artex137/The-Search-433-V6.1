      <h2>Leaked Video Shows US Military Engaging UAP with Missile</h2>

<p>A recently leaked video reveals the US military firing a Hellfire missile at an unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAP) off the coast of Yemen in October 2024. The missile strike, which was captured by an MQ-9 Reaper drone, reportedly had little impact on the UAP, which continued its flight path almost immediately after being hit. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as it raises questions about the capabilities of UAPs and the effectiveness of military technology. The video was shared by Missouri Republican Representative Eric Burlison during a UAP Caucus hearing and subsequently posted on social media. The Department of Defense has not provided any additional comments regarding the event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred off the coast of Yemen in October 2024.</li>
    <li>UAP was tracked by an MQ-9 Reaper drone.</li>
    <li>A Hellfire missile was fired at the UAP, resulting in minimal effect.</li>
    <li>Video was leaked to Rep. Eric Burlison, who posted it on X on September 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>The UAP continued moving after the missile strike.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2024, the US military conducted operations against Houthi rebels in Yemen. During this time, an MQ-9 Reaper drone tracked a UAP over water. A second drone received the green light to engage the target, firing a Hellfire missile.</p>
<p>Following the missile strike, an explosion occurred, but the UAP quickly corrected its course and continued to fly. The video documenting this incident was leaked and shared publicly by Rep. Eric Burlison nearly a year later on September 9, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “That’s the Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just (bouncing) right off. And it kept going.” 
    <br>— George Knapp, UAP Journalist
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I have nothing for you.” 
    <br>— Department of Defense representative, in response to ABC News inquiry
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident adds to a growing body of evidence regarding UAPs and has sparked renewed interest in military encounters with unexplained aerial phenomena. The military's term for UFOs, UAP, reflects an ongoing investigation into these occurrences, as well as public and governmental interest in understanding their implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident are likely to continue as authorities assess the implications of the video and the capabilities of the UAP. Further reports from the Department of Defense may be forthcoming, although no specific timelines have been disclosed.</p>
