      <h2>3I/ATLAS breakthrough – ingredients for life and sharp brightening detected at interstellar visitor</h2>

<p>A NASA spacecraft has detected organic molecules and a sharp increase in brightness from comet 3I/ATLAS during observations made in December 2025. The comet, which is currently passing through our Solar System, was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has been closely monitored by various telescopes and missions since its discovery.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because the organic molecules found at 3I/ATLAS, including methanol, cyanide, and methane, may be foundational for biological processes. However, scientists note that these molecules can also be produced by non-biological processes. Observations are critical, as 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar bodies and is nearing the end of its observable period.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Recent observations conducted in December 2025 by NASA's SPHEREx spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Organic molecules detected include methanol, cyanide, and methane.</li>
    <li>Sharp increase in brightness noted two months post-close approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx launched in March 2025 to study the origins of the Universe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025. It has since made close passes of the Sun and Earth, allowing for extensive observation. SPHEREx performed its first observations of the comet in August 2025 and followed up with additional observations in December 2025, revealing significant changes in the comet's activity and composition.</p>

<p>During the December observations, scientists reported a dramatic increase in the comet's brightness, attributed to the sublimation of water ice and the release of organic material. This event is typical for comets after close solar approaches.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, after its close flyby of the Sun, causing it to significantly brighten,” said Carey Lisse, study lead at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The pristine ices below the surface are warming up and erupting, releasing a cocktail of chemicals that haven’t been exposed to space for billions of years,” remarked Phil Korngut, the mission’s instrument scientist at Caltech.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three interstellar bodies discovered to date. Its unique composition and behavior provide insights into the materials that existed in the early Solar System. The observations made by SPHEREx contribute to a growing understanding of how such bodies interact with solar energy and evolve over time.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the end of its observable period, scientists will continue to analyze data from SPHEREx and other missions to deepen their understanding of the comet's composition and activity. Future observations may yield further insights into the origins of organic materials in our Solar System.</p>
