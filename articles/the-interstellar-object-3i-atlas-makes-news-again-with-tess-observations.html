      <h2>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS makes news again with TESS observations</h2>

<p>The TESS space observatory has conducted a series of observations of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS from January 15 to 22, 2023, as it enters its departure phase from the Solar System. The observations have provided astronomers with data to reconstruct the comet's trajectory and behavior, according to the mission team.</p>

<p>This monitoring is significant as it offers insights into the composition and activity of celestial objects not bound to our Sun. The data collected from TESS will aid researchers in understanding the physical mechanisms of 3I/ATLAS and similar interstellar comets. The information is now publicly available for further analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observations conducted between January 15 and 22, 2023.</li>
    <li>TESS recorded a bright point moving against the starry background, leaving a faint trail.</li>
    <li>Measurements indicate an apparent magnitude of about 11.5.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to be invisible to the naked eye until July 2025.</li>
    <li>The observations were repurposed to study 3I/ATLAS after its passage was recorded several months earlier.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between January 15 and 22, 2023, TESS captured a series of images of 3I/ATLAS as it moved through the Solar System. The observations allowed scientists to analyze the comet's activity, including dust and gas ejections. A video sequence was then compiled, illustrating the comet's path over 28 hours. However, an interruption occurred due to a satellite safe mode, creating a time jump in the sequence.</p>

<p>Prior to its official identification, TESS had recorded the comet's passage, which helped astronomers reconstruct its route. The data collected has since been made publicly accessible for further research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The January observations offer several hours of data to analyze. Researchers hope to find recurring patterns in brightness changes, which could provide additional information about the properties of 3I/ATLAS,” a representative from the TESS mission said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS are unique as they are not bound to any star and travel through the galaxy on open trajectories. Such comets bring primordial materials from distant stellar systems, providing a rare opportunity to study their composition and physical characteristics. The identification of these objects is a relatively recent development in astronomy, with only a few confirmed examples known to date.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will analyze the data from the January observations to uncover more about 3I/ATLAS and its properties. Further studies may reveal insights into the origins and behavior of interstellar comets as they continue to traverse the Solar System.</p>
