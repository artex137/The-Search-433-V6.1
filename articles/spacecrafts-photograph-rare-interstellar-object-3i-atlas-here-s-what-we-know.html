      <h2>Spacecraft photograph rare interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Several spacecraft have photographed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, with the closest encounter occurring on October 3, 2023, when it passed approximately 18.6 million miles from Mars. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its status as one of only three known interstellar objects in Earth's vicinity. As it nears the sun, public interest in this cosmic visitor has surged, prompting further observations by various space agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: Approximately 18.6 million miles</li>
    <li>Speed at discovery: About 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Upcoming observations: ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) from November 2-25, 2023</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to the sun: October 30, 2023, at 130 million miles</li>
    <li>Next visibility from Earth: December 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object in July 2023, when it was confirmed to originate from outside the solar system. The Minor Planet Center recorded its observation, which indicated its high speed and potential as a comet.</p>

<p>From October 1-7, 2023, two orbiters, Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, imaged the comet as it approached Mars. The closest approach occurred on October 3, allowing for the collection of images that show the object as a fuzzy white dot.</p>

<p>Further observations are planned with the ESA's Juice spacecraft, which will capture images as 3I/ATLAS enters a "very active state" closer to its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one," said Colin Wilson, project manager for both missions at the European Space Agency. "I look forward to seeing what the data reveals following further analysis.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is named for its discovery by the ATLAS telescope. It follows the first detected interstellar object, Comet Oumuamua, in 2017, and the comet Borisov in 2019. Unlike these previous objects, 3I/ATLAS is traveling on a hyperbolic orbit, meaning it will eventually exit the solar system.</p>

<p>The object has been observed by various telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, which have contributed to understanding its composition and behavior as it approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations of 3I/ATLAS will occur from November 2-25, 2023, by the ESA's Juice spacecraft. Scientists anticipate receiving data from these observations in February 2024, as the comet continues its trajectory through the solar system.</p>
