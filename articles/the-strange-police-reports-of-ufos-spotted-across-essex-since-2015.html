      <h2>The strange police reports of UFOs spotted across Essex since 2015</h2>

<p>Essex Police have received multiple reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) across the region since 2015, according to a recent disclosure made under the Freedom of Information Act. The reports include sightings of various lights and objects in the sky, with the most recent incident occurring in Southend-on-Sea in 2024.</p>

<p>This information is significant as it highlights public interest in aerial phenomena and the responses from law enforcement. Authorities have sought to clarify the nature of these sightings, with some being attributed to known sources like Adventure Island.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First report: 2015, Braintree – Bright orange light, vertical shape aircraft</li>
    <li>Last report: 2024, Southend-on-Sea – Three strange purple lights, likely from Adventure Island</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Reports of UFO sightings in Essex have emerged at various intervals since 2015. The first report documented a bright orange light in Braintree that sped off quickly. In 2018, a witness described a green light resembling a comet above the M25. The following year, in Basildon, an individual reported seeing what looked like two drones on fire.</p>

<p>In 2020, a person in Saffron Walden observed a flaming ball in the sky while driving. The next year, a witness in Chelmsford noted multiple lights dancing in the sky after leaving church. In 2022, pilots at Stansted Airport reported an unidentified object below them, although they could not see anything upon inspection. The most recent report, in 2024, involved three purple lights in Southend-on-Sea.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reports have been varied and intriguing, but many have been explained by known phenomena,” said an Essex Police spokesperson. “We encourage anyone who sees something unusual to report it to us.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
