      <h2>America’s “Most Dramatic” UFO Encounter: 73 Years After D.C. Skies Were Swarmed, Unexplained Objects Stalk Pilots Again</h2>

<p>Pilots have reported a surge in unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), echoing events from the 1952 Washington Flap. This recent spike in sightings has raised concerns among military and aviation authorities, prompting further investigation into the phenomena.</p>

<p>This resurgence matters because it reflects ongoing interest and concern regarding aerial safety and national security. The U.S. Air Force has previously investigated UFO sightings to determine if they pose a threat, and current reports may lead to renewed scrutiny and inquiry into these incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Surge in UFO sightings reported by pilots in recent months.</li>
    <li>Historical context tied to the 1952 Washington Flap.</li>
    <li>U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book investigated UFO sightings.</li>
    <li>Major media coverage of UFOs spurred public interest and panic in 1952.</li>
    <li>Declassified files show radar-visual confirmations labeled as “unknowns.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 1952, radar operators at Washington National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base tracked unidentified objects over several weekends. On July 19-20, radar detected erratic blips, later confirmed by a commercial pilot who observed bright lights. On July 26, multiple radars picked up over a dozen solid targets displaying unusual maneuvers.</p>

<p>Lt. William L. Patterson and Capt. John McHugo were dispatched to intercept these targets. Patterson confirmed seeing four bright lights that did not blink or drift. As he approached, the lights converged on his aircraft and then disappeared, leaving him without further visual contact. His wingman reported no sightings during the engagement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Those people have seen something,” said Albert Einstein regarding the UFO sightings during the 1952 events.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Maj. Gen. John Samford stated, “There is about a 50/50 probability that the blips were caused by a temperature inversion,” during a press conference addressing the public concern.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The modern UFO phenomenon began in 1947, following pilot Kenneth Arnold’s sighting of flying disks near Mount Rainier. The 1952 Washington Flap generated mass hysteria, with nearly 16,000 stories published in major newspapers within six months. The Air Force’s Project Blue Book, established to investigate UFOs, officially classified the Washington sightings as “unknowns,” a designation that remains today.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into recent UFO sightings are ongoing, with authorities expected to review pilot reports and radar data. The potential for further public disclosure and military responses to these incidents remains a topic of interest as the phenomenon continues to evolve.</p>
