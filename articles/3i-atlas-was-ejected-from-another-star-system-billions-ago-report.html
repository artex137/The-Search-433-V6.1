      <h2>3I/ATLAS Was Ejected From Another Star System Billions Ago: Report</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, after being discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. The comet has not posed any threat to Earth, as it will pass approximately 170 million miles away from the planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it offers astronomers a rare opportunity to study material from another star system. 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. NASA officials have stated that the object is not a threat to life on Earth, dismissing various conspiracy theories that have emerged regarding its nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> About 137,000 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated size:</strong> Between 1,400 feet and 3.5 miles wide</li>
    <li><strong>Previous closest approach:</strong> October 30, 2025, within 130 million miles of the sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, astronomers confirmed its interstellar origin and trajectory, noting its hyperbolic orbit. The comet is projected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and has been travelling from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2025, the comet passed within 130 million miles of the sun, just inside the orbit of Mars. Observations have indicated that the comet is composed of material from another star system and has been drifting through space for potentially billions of years.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy in response to conspiracy theories regarding the comet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” stated Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our Solar System. Previous objects, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also sparked interest in the scientific community and among the general public. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has reignited discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial life, despite scientific consensus dismissing these claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observers will need at least a small telescope to view the comet, which is not visible to the naked eye. The comet is expected to remain observable in the pre-dawn sky until spring 2026.</p>
