      <h2>NASA Captures Stunning Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Passing Mars</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed the comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, as it passed near Mars between October 1 and 7, 2025. The European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA's Perseverance rover captured unprecedented images of the comet approximately 30 million kilometers from Earth. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant for scientists as 3I/ATLAS, officially designated as 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 M1), is the third interstellar object detected, following the discoveries of ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Researchers believe the comet may be over three billion years older than the Solar System, offering insights into the early universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was photographed passing Mars between October 1 and 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 30 million kilometers from Earth during its flyby.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is about one kilometer in diameter.</li>
    <li>ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express captured the images.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, after ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>ESA's JUICE spacecraft is scheduled for additional observations in November 2025.</li>
    <li>The Comet Interceptor mission is set to launch in 2029.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between October 1 and 7, 2025, ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express focused their high-resolution cameras on deep space to capture images of 3I/ATLAS. The TGO's CaSSIS instrument recorded a series of faint images showing the comet's icy nucleus and its surrounding coma.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approached the Sun, solar radiation began to heat its icy surface, leading to the formation of the coma. Observations have not yet detected the comet's tail, which is expected to develop as it gets closer to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It’s exciting to see our orbiters — usually focused on Mars — respond to rare, unplanned events like this. It’s a reminder of how dynamic and interconnected our Solar System really is.” 
    <strong>— Colin Wilson, ESA scientist</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS marks a significant milestone in space exploration. Unlike typical comets that originate within the Solar System, this comet has traveled through interstellar space for eons. Studying such objects can help scientists understand the materials that formed in other star systems billions of years ago.</p>

<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the detection of interstellar objects like ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov has spurred interest in the origins and compositions of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The European Space Agency plans to continue tracking 3I/ATLAS in the coming months. The JUICE spacecraft is expected to conduct further observations in November 2025 as the comet approaches the Sun. ESA's Comet Interceptor mission, set to launch in 2029, aims to study newly discovered interstellar comets, enhancing our understanding of planetary formation and cosmic evolution.</p>
