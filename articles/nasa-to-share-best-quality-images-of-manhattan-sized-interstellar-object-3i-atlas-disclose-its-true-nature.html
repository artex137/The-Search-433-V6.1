      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-30 14:23 UTC</p>

      <h2>NASA to share best-quality images of Manhattan-sized interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, disclose its true nature</h2>

<p>NASA plans to release high-resolution images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is approximately the size of Manhattan, in the coming days. The images were captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera during its pass by Mars from October 1 to October 7. The release was delayed due to a government shutdown that ended late Wednesday.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it will provide the clearest images of 3I/ATLAS to date, surpassing those taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has expressed concerns about the delay, criticizing it as a reflection of government inefficiency. He believes that the upcoming images will help reveal the true nature of the interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately the size of Manhattan</li>
    <li><strong>Imaging period:</strong> October 1 to October 7</li>
    <li><strong>Imaging instrument:</strong> HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
    <li><strong>Previous images:</strong> Taken by Hubble Space Telescope on July 21</li>
    <li><strong>Next target:</strong> Jupiter</li>
    <li><strong>Exit from solar system:</strong> March</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS from October 1 to October 7. These images were not released due to the government shutdown, which concluded late Wednesday. The agency plans to publish the new images as early as next week.</p>

<p>On July 21, the Hubble Space Telescope provided the first images of 3I/ATLAS, which have been the clearest until now. Earlier this week, sky watchers noted that 3I/ATLAS remained intact following its close approach to the Sun, dispelling initial concerns about the object breaking apart.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist: "Science should have been prioritized over bureaucracy. The truth about the nature of 3I/ATLAS will be revealed by the sharing of data, not by the storyline of gatekeepers."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb: "The HiRISE image would give us a side-view as well as a spatial resolution that is three times better than that of the Hubble Space Telescope. Even though the image is unlikely to resolve the solid nucleus itself, it can set a tight constraint on its diameter based on the brightest pixel. A picture is worth a thousand words."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest due to its unique features, including an unusual anti-tail not typically seen in comets. This has led to various hypotheses about its composition and origin. The anticipation surrounding the upcoming images has heightened interest in interstellar objects and their potential implications for understanding the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will release the new images of 3I/ATLAS next week. Following this, the object will be monitored by NASA’s Juno space probe and the European Space Agency’s JUICE spacecraft as it approaches Jupiter, before exiting the solar system in March.</p>
