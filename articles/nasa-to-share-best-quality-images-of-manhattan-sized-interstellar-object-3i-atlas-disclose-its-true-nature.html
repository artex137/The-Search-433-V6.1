      <h2>NASA to share best-quality images of Manhattan-sized interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA is set to release high-resolution images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as early as next week, according to an agency source. The images were captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera during its pass by Mars from October 1 to October 7. These images were delayed due to a government shutdown that ended late Wednesday.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as they are expected to provide the clearest view of 3I/ATLAS to date, surpassing previous images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has emphasized the importance of this data, suggesting it could reveal the object's true nature. He criticized the delay in releasing the images, stating that scientific progress should take precedence over bureaucratic issues.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, a Manhattan-sized interstellar object</li>
    <li>Images captured by: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera</li>
    <li>Image capture dates: October 1 to October 7</li>
    <li>Expected release date: As early as next week</li>
    <li>Previous best images taken by: Hubble Space Telescope on July 21</li>
    <li>Future observation: NASA's Juno space probe and ESA's JUICE spacecraft will monitor 3I/ATLAS until March</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS between October 1 and October 7. These images were not released immediately due to a government shutdown. The shutdown ended on Wednesday, clearing the way for the anticipated release of the images next week.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, 3I/ATLAS emerged intact after a close encounter with the Sun, dispelling concerns that the object had broken apart. It is now on a trajectory toward Jupiter, where it will be observed by NASA and European space agencies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Science should have been prioritized over bureaucracy. The truth about the nature of 3I/ATLAS will be revealed by the sharing of data, not by the storyline of gatekeepers.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also noted, “Even though the image is unlikely to resolve the solid nucleus itself, it can set a tight constraint on its diameter based on the brightest pixel. A picture is worth a thousand words.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The object 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention due to its unique features, including a mysterious anti-tail not typically observed in comets. Loeb has previously raised concerns about this characteristic, suggesting it may indicate something unusual about the object.</p>

<p>The delay in image release has sparked discussions about the efficiency of government processes in scientific research and public communication.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to release the images of 3I/ATLAS next week. Following this release, the object will continue to be observed by NASA's Juno probe and the European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft until it exits the solar system in March.</p>
