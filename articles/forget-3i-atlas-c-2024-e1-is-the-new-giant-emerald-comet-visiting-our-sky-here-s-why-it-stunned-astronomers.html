      <h2>New Comet C/2024 E1 Stuns Astronomers as It Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>A newly discovered comet, C/2024 E1, has captured the attention of astronomers as it passes Earth at a distance of approximately 151 million kilometres. The comet, which was first spotted on March 3, 2024, is currently too faint for the naked eye, measuring at a magnitude of +7, according to reports from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</p>

<p>This comet is significant for scientific study, as it provides insights into the early solar system. Researchers have noted that C/2024 E1 is a remnant from the Oort Cloud, having been in a frozen state for billions of years. The comet is expected to drift into interstellar space after its flyby.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> C/2024 E1</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> March 3, 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> +7</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 151 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Magnitude at Discovery:</strong> 20.4</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Constellation Sculptor, visible in the south-western sky from the northern hemisphere</li>
    <li><strong>Size Estimate:</strong> Between 2 and 10 kilometres across</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On March 3, 2024, Polish astronomer Kacper Wierzchoś first detected C/2024 E1 using a 1.5-metre telescope at Mount Lemmon in Arizona. The comet was initially recorded at a faint magnitude of 20.4, over a billion kilometres from the Sun.</p>
<p>In June 2024, the JWST captured observations of the comet from a distance of approximately 7 astronomical units (AU), roughly the distance of Jupiter from the Sun. The findings were published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Letters.</p>
<p>As of now, C/2024 E1 is passing Earth and is set to leave the solar system entirely over the coming decades or centuries.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activity driving this comet's coma is CO₂ sublimation, confirmed by JWST,” said a representative from the research team. “The green glow comes from a different mechanism entirely.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2024 E1 is one of several comets that have been observed in recent years. Unlike 3I/ATLAS, which is an interstellar object, C/2024 E1 formed within our solar system and has spent billions of years in the Oort Cloud. The green coloration of comets is not uncommon and results from diatomic carbon molecules fluorescing under ultraviolet light when near the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>C/2024 E1 will continue to drift away from the solar system, with its trajectory confirmed as hyperbolic. While it will not return, astronomers will continue to study its properties and behavior as it leaves the solar system.</p>
