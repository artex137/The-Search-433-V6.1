      <h2>The buzz over an ‘alien’ interstellar comet shows how way-out speculation goes viral</h2>

<p>Speculation about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has escalated since its discovery in July 2025, drawing attention from enthusiasts of unidentified flying objects and researchers alike. Mert Bayar, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Washington, has analyzed this phenomenon, revealing how social media influencers contribute to the spread of theories surrounding the comet’s potential extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<p>This analysis matters as it highlights the impact of social media on public perception and the proliferation of conspiracy theories. Bayar's research, published this week, examines how discussions about 3I/ATLAS have evolved and the role that prominent figures, such as Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, have played in shaping those narratives.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Bayar analyzed approximately 700,000 posts on X (Twitter) from July 1 to November 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>About 280,000 posts, or 40%, reference aliens or extraterrestrial technology.</li>
    <li>Approximately 130,000 posts mention Avi Loeb by name.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers first spotted 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third known celestial interloper entering the solar system from beyond. Following its discovery, speculation about alien technology began to surface, fueled in part by the work of Avi Loeb, who had previously suggested that another interstellar object, 'Oumuamua, might be an alien probe.</p>

<p>Between July and November 2025, Bayar tracked online discussions about 3I/ATLAS, noting a significant increase in posts linking the comet to extraterrestrial theories. This culminated in his recent publication, which sheds light on the dynamics of conspiracy theories in the context of space exploration.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Where natural explanations feel incomplete, we substitute a different higher agency, not Zeus this time, but extraterrestrials,” said Mert Bayar, explaining the phenomenon surrounding 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“To be fair, at times, Avi Loeb states that 3I/ATLAS is most likely a natural interstellar comet,” Bayar acknowledged, “but he then spends far more time walking through its supposed ‘anomalies’ and entertaining the alien-technology hypothesis.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Bayar's research follows a trend where social media platforms amplify speculative narratives, particularly regarding science and technology. This phenomenon is not limited to astronomy; it extends to various areas of public interest, including health and politics. The term “mystery economy” describes how content creators thrive on producing and sharing speculative content, often leading to misinformation.</p>

<p>The analysis of 3I/ATLAS serves as a case study for understanding how misinformation can spread in the digital age, especially when tied to influential figures like Loeb.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on December 19, 2025, there will be increased opportunities for astronomers to capture images of the comet. This event may further fuel online speculation and discussions about its origins and implications for extraterrestrial life.</p>
