      <h2>Astronomers Discover Unique Tail on Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS, Challenging Theories of Cosmic Bodies</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered a faint, teardrop-shaped tail on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which stretches approximately 56,400 kilometers behind the comet and points directly away from the Sun. This finding was reported by physicist Avi Loeb in a Medium article, following observations made using the Gemini South 8.2-meter telescope located atop Cerro Pachón in the Chilean Andes.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it adds to the growing list of peculiar features surrounding 3I/ATLAS, which appears to diverge from typical cometary behavior. Researchers are now examining the implications of this unique tail and the object's composition, which could redefine classifications of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery of a teardrop-shaped tail measuring approximately 56,400 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The tail points in the anti-solar direction, aligned southeast.</li>
    <li>A coma surrounding the object spans about 18,800 kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS releases carbon dioxide at a rate of 130 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The object generates 6.6 kilograms per second of water and 14 kilograms per second of carbon monoxide.</li>
    <li>Diameter of 3I/ATLAS measured at 46 kilometers, suggesting a mass approximately one million times greater than interstellar comet 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is expected on October 29, 2025, increasing exposure to solar heat and radiation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's TESS mission first detected a persistent glow from 3I/ATLAS in May 2025, when the object was six astronomical units from the Sun.</p>
<p>Observations in early August 2025, using the SPHEREx mission, suggested a diameter of 46 kilometers for 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>As the perihelion approaches on October 29, 2025, further studies are anticipated to reveal more about this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“A high stress environment elicits confessions,” said Avi Loeb, indicating that forthcoming studies may uncover the secrets of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS's characteristics challenge current astrophysical models, which typically predict that smaller interstellar bodies should be more common and detectable. The object’s trajectory is also notably aligned with the ecliptic plane, a rarity among interstellar objects.</p>
<p>Previous observations of 3I/ATLAS have revealed a unique composition, with a significant carbon dioxide plume and unusual absence of iron, suggesting a potential industrial process rather than natural astrophysical events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, with upcoming studies expected to provide insights into the object's origins and behaviors.</p>
