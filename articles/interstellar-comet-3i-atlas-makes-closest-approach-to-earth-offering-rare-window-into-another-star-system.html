      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Makes Closest Approach to Earth</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing at a distance of about 1.8 astronomical units (AU), or approximately 270 million kilometers. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This close pass has provided astronomers with a rare opportunity to study the comet, which is moving too quickly to be gravitationally bound to the Sun. Researchers have utilized spacecraft and ground-based telescopes to gather data on its speed, orbit, and activity during this brief window of observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 1.8 AU (approximately 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed at discovery:</strong> 221,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Speed near perihelion:</strong> 246,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Detection:</strong> July 1, 2025, by NASA-supported ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus size estimate:</strong> Between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter</li>
    <li><strong>Notable observations:</strong> Dust plume and two tails detected by ESA's JUICE mission</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS using a NASA-supported telescope in Chile. Within days, follow-up tracking began worldwide as early orbital analyses revealed the comet's hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is a one-time visitor from interstellar space.</p>

<p>Leading up to the closest approach on December 19, astronomers worked to gather as much data as possible. Observations from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and ESA’s JUICE mission provided insight into the comet’s characteristics and behavior, with JUICE capturing images and data on November 4, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS behaves in broadly comet-like ways when heated, even though it formed elsewhere,” NASA stated in a report.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The faster an unusual object is discovered, the more time scientists have to coordinate observations and gather valuable data,” said a representative from the Southwest Research Institute.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following earlier discoveries. These objects provide a unique opportunity to study materials that may have formed around other stars, offering insights into the composition and behavior of comets from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>Modern survey networks, originally designed for planetary defense, have proven to be effective tools for basic scientific research, enabling timely discoveries of unusual celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from both the Hubble and JUICE missions, with further findings expected in February 2026. The scientific community is particularly interested in comparing the gases and dust characteristics of 3I/ATLAS with those of comets from our solar system and previous interstellar visitors.</p>
