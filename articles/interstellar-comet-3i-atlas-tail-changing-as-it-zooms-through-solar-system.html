      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS tail changing as it zooms through solar system</h2>

<p>Astronomers have been tracking comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-ever discovered interstellar object, as it moves through the solar system. The comet was first spotted on July 1 by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile. Recent images captured by the Gemini South telescope show a growing tail on the comet, indicating changes in its activity.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the behavior and composition of interstellar objects. Multiple observatories, including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the International Gemini Observatory in Chile, are monitoring the comet's journey. Experts aim to understand how 3I/ATLAS changes as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Recent images show a tail spinning across about 1/120th of a degree in the sky.</li>
    <li>The tail has become more pronounced compared to earlier images from July.</li>
    <li>Observations have revealed a coma dominated by carbon dioxide, the highest ever observed in a comet.</li>
    <li>Future observations are planned for November after the comet passes behind the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted by ATLAS in Chile. Since then, astronomers have utilized various telescopes to monitor its progress. On August 27, the Gemini South telescope captured new images of the comet, revealing a growing tail and providing new details about its color and composition. Recent observations have highlighted unusual chemical signatures, particularly a high concentration of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>In late September, the comet is expected to dip behind the Sun, after which it will re-emerge in November for further observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "These features are significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images of the comet, showing that 3I/ATLAS has become more active as it travels through the inner Solar System," said a representative from the National Science Foundation NOIRLab.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "We were excited to see the growth of the tail, suggesting a change in the particles from the previous Gemini images, and we got our first glimpse of the chemistry from the spectrum," stated Karen Meech from the University of Hawai‘i Institute for Astronomy.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object tracked through the solar system, following Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Understanding these objects can provide valuable information about the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and re-emerges in November. Further analysis of the comet's tail and chemical composition is planned, which will enhance our understanding of this interstellar visitor.</p>
