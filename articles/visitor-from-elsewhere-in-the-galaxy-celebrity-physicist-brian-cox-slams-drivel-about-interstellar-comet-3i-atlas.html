      <h2>Visitor from elsewhere in the galaxy: Celebrity physicist Brian Cox slams “drivel” about interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Celebrated physicist Brian Cox has criticized misleading information regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is set to make its closest approach to the sun on Thursday, October 30. In a post on his X account, Cox described the inaccuracies as “drivel” and clarified the comet's natural origin and expected orbit.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention due to the comet's unusual characteristics and the public interest it has sparked. NASA has recently captured the sharpest images of 3I/ATLAS using the Hubble Space Telescope, providing insights into its size and composition. Cox's statements aim to address misconceptions and highlight the scientific significance of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass closest to the sun on October 30.</li>
<li>Cox described the comet as made of carbon dioxide, water ices, and other materials.</li>
<li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
<li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at approximately 209,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
<li>Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope has provided the clearest images of the comet to date.</li>
<li>The comet poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2019 and has since been observed as it travels through our solar system. Recently, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured detailed images of the comet, revealing its physical properties. On October 30, the comet will make its closest approach to the sun, marking a significant event in its trajectory.</p>

<p>Brian Cox's comments came amid rising public interest and speculation about the comet, aiming to clarify its nature and significance. His remarks emphasize the importance of scientific accuracy in understanding such phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
Cox stated, “Just to be clear - given recent drivel online - Comet 3I/ATLAS is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff. It is entirely natural in origin, its orbit is as expected and it will whizz around the sun and then disappear off into the galaxy again.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
David Jewit, the University of California science team leader for the Hubble observations, noted, “No one knows where the comet came from. It’s like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second. You can't project that back with any accuracy to figure out where it started on its path.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, interstellar comets have been rare observations, with 3I/ATLAS being a notable example. The scientific community has focused on understanding the origins and characteristics of such celestial bodies, contributing to broader knowledge about the formation of solar systems.</p>

<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS aligns with ongoing research into near-Earth objects and space debris, which NASA monitors as part of its mission to ensure planetary safety.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach on October 30, scientists will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gain further insights into its composition and trajectory, contributing to the understanding of interstellar objects and their impact on our solar system.</p>
