      <h2>NASA and ESA Capture New Images of Active Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Ahead of December Close Approach to Earth</h2>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting signs of activity as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach scheduled for December 19, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the comet.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks the comet's close pass to Earth, offering scientists a unique opportunity to study an object that has traveled through interstellar space for potentially billions of years. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) have provided valuable data, revealing the comet's features and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass within approximately 170 million miles of Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was first confirmed in July 2023 as the third interstellar object recognized by scientists.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at a speed of 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Its size is estimated to be between 1,400 feet and 3.5 miles wide.</li>
    <li>Hubble's latest observations were taken on November 30, 2023, from approximately 178 million miles away.</li>
    <li>Amateur astronomers can observe the comet in the pre-dawn sky until spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, 3I/ATLAS was confirmed as an interstellar object. It has since been tracked as it travels on a hyperbolic path, which will eventually lead it out of the solar system. Notably, close observations were made on October 30, 2023, following its pass near the sun, which increased its activity.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2023, Hubble captured new images of the comet, revealing its glowing halo and two tails. The ESA's Juice mission also gathered partial images during this period, although comprehensive data is expected to be released in February 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy</strong> stated, "There is no threat to life here on Earth."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Nicola Fox</strong> from NASA's Science Mission Directorate emphasized, "No detectable technosignatures have been observed that would suggest anything other than a natural comet."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following previous discoveries that have sparked interest in the study of extraterrestrial materials. Its unusual journey has led to various theories about its origin, including speculation by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb regarding the possibility of it being an alien spacecraft.</p>
<p>NASA officials have actively addressed these theories, reinforcing the understanding of 3I/ATLAS as a natural cosmic phenomenon rather than an artificial object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its approach to Earth, scientists will analyze the data collected by Hubble and Juice. Further observations will enhance our understanding of this interstellar visitor, with comprehensive data from the Juice mission expected in February 2024.</p>
