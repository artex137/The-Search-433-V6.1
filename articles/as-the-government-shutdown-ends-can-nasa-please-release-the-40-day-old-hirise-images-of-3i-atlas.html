      <h2>As the Government Shutdown Ends, Can NASA Please Release the 40-Day-Old HiRISE Images of 3I/ATLAS?</h2>

<p>NASA has yet to release images of comet 3I/ATLAS taken by the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter during its close approach to Mars on October 2-3, 2025. The images, which feature a resolution of 30 kilometers per pixel and were captured when 3I/ATLAS passed within 29 million kilometers of Mars, have been held due to a government shutdown that lasted 40 days.</p>

<p>The release of this data is significant as it could provide insights into the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which has been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny. According to Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project, the public interest in the mysteries surrounding the comet is unprecedented. With the government shutdown ending, calls for transparency and the release of scientific data have intensified.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed within 29 million kilometers of Mars on October 2-3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The HiRISE camera took images with a resolution of 30 kilometers per pixel.</li>
    <li>The images have been held for 40 days due to the government shutdown.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is the head of the Galileo Project and a prominent figure in the study of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2-3, 2025, the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS during its close approach to Mars.</p>
<p>Following the images' capture, a government shutdown delayed their release for 40 days.</p>
<p>As of November 11, 2025, Earth-based observatories have resumed focus on 3I/ATLAS as its angular separation from the Sun has grown beyond 30 degrees.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As the government shutdown is about to end, can NASA please release the data that was held hostage by politics for 40 days? Scientific knowledge should not be second in priority to bureaucracy.”</blockquote>
<p>- Anna Paulina Luna, Congresswoman</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has been a focus of scientific debate due to its unusual characteristics. Some experts have raised questions about its classification, suggesting that its behaviour could indicate a technological origin rather than a purely natural one. This discussion has sparked interest among scientists and the public alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth approaches on December 19, 2025, scientists will continue to measure the speed, mass density, and composition of the jets observed around the comet. The release of the HiRISE images may provide critical data for ongoing research into the nature of this interstellar object.</p>
