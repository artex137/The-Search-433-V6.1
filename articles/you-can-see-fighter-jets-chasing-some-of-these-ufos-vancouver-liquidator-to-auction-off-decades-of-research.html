      <h2>‘You can see fighter jets chasing some of these UFOs’: Vancouver liquidator to auction off decades of research</h2>

<p>A Vancouver liquidator is set to auction a unique collection of UFO research materials next month. Jeff Schwarz, owner of East Vancouver’s Direct Liquidation, describes the collection as one of the most unusual he has encountered in his 40 years of business. The materials include documents, alleged extraterrestrial encounter records, and declassified government files.</p>

<p>This auction matters as it highlights ongoing public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial phenomena. The collection comes from California producer Chris Wyatt, who has amassed extensive research on the subject, including thousands of pages of documents and photographs. Wyatt hopes a production company will purchase the materials to further investigate these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Collection includes decades of UFO research, government documents, and photographs.</li>
    <li>Jeff Schwarz has operated Direct Liquidation for 40 years.</li>
    <li>Collection sourced from Chris Wyatt, known as Hollywood’s de facto UFO producer.</li>
    <li>Includes a rare yearbook from Roswell Air Force Base, linked to a 1947 alleged UFO crash.</li>
    <li>Wyatt estimates the yearbook could sell for over $100,000.</li>
    <li>Auction is scheduled for next month.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Chris Wyatt began collecting UFO-related materials in the 1990s while producing documentaries on the subject. Over the years, he gathered thousands of documents and photographs, including interviews with witnesses and evidence of government investigations.</p>

<p>In 1947, the Roswell Air Force Base yearbook was reportedly ordered to be destroyed by the military to prevent media from accessing it. Wyatt obtained a copy from a former officer before his passing, who regarded it as his prized possession.</p>

<p>The collection has sparked renewed interest in UFO lore in Vancouver, a city known for its connections to UFO sightings and the filming of The X-Files.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’ve been doing this for 40 years, I get all kinds of stuff. Getting something like this – I would say it’s probably in the top one, if not the top one,”</blockquote> said Jeff Schwarz, owner of Direct Liquidation.

<blockquote>“You can see fighter jets chasing some of these UFOs,”</blockquote> Schwarz remarked while reviewing the photo collection.

<blockquote>“The military ordered all of the yearbooks from 1947 to be turned in and destroyed,”</blockquote> Wyatt explained regarding the Roswell yearbook.

<blockquote>“I’d be surprised if it sold for less than $100,000,”</blockquote> Wyatt stated about the potential auction price for the yearbook.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The auction comes at a time when interest in UFOs has surged, partly due to recent government disclosures about unidentified aerial phenomena. Vancouver has a long history of UFO sightings and has served as a backdrop for numerous media portrayals of extraterrestrial encounters, including the popular series The X-Files.</p>

<p>Past incidents and a growing acceptance of UFO discussions have contributed to a cultural environment where such collections are increasingly valued.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The auction is scheduled for next month, and both Jeff Schwarz and Chris Wyatt hope the collection will be acquired by a production company interested in further investigation into the materials.</p>
