      <h2>'Other Atlas', the golden comet, breaks apart as it zooms towards Earth</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS), also referred to as the “other Atlas,” has broken into several pieces after reaching perihelion on October 8. Astronomer Gianluca Masi reported the comet's fragmentation from Manciano, Italy. The comet is currently moving towards Earth and will approach at a distance of 60 million km on November 25.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it highlights the comet's unexpected survival near the Sun and its unusual colour change from green to golden. Authorities and astronomers are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and condition as it continues to lose mass.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: C/2025 K1 (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: November 25, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest point: 60 million km</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached: October 8, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovery: May 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Manciano, Italy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered in May 2025 by astronomers at ATLAS. It reached perihelion on October 8, 2025, where it was expected to break apart. Instead, it survived, but subsequent observations revealed that it has fragmented into several pieces.</p>
<p>On October 8, astronomer Gianluca Masi observed the comet from Italy, noting that it had broken apart while being stretched by the Sun's gravitational force. The comet is now on a trajectory towards Earth, with its closest approach scheduled for November 25, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Several parts (sub-nuclei or clouds of debris) are visible, also a plume just below the leading fragment,” said Gianluca Masi, founder of The Virtual Telescope Project.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This comet was not supposed to survive its October 8th perihelion, but it did,” stated astrophotographer Dan Bartlett.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We don't know exactly why” the comet turned golden, noted astronomer David Schleicher, suggesting it could be due to a lack of carbon-bearing molecules.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is notable for its unusual golden hue, a rarity among comets typically characterized by a green colour due to dicarbon or cyanide. Previous comets, such as 12P/Pons-Brooks and C/2022 E3, have displayed greenish hues. Only two other comets have exhibited similar golden features, according to astronomer David Schleicher.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) as it approaches Earth, monitoring its fragmentation and changes in appearance. The scientific community is particularly interested in understanding the reasons behind its colour change and the implications for its future trajectory.</p>
