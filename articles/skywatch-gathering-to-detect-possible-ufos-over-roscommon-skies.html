      <h2>Skywatch gathering to detect possible UFOs over Roscommon skies</h2>

<p>Members of the public are invited to a skywatch event at Lough Key Forest Park in Boyle, County Roscommon, on Saturday evening from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. The gathering, led by local UFO expert Dr. Eamon Ansboro, aims to spot potential extraterrestrial phenomena in the area. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>This skywatch is significant as it highlights ongoing interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). Dr. Ansboro has dedicated over thirty years to researching intelligent life beyond Earth, presenting his findings to various scientific organizations. His work has drawn attention to the presence of “plasma orbs,” which he claims have been documented by NASA.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: Saturday, from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</li>
    <li>Location: Lough Key Forest Park, Boyle, County Roscommon</li>
    <li>Organizer: Dr. Eamon Ansboro, UFO expert and astronomer</li>
    <li>Number of unusual aerial sightings detected: 40 in North Roscommon over the last twenty years</li>
    <li>Diameter of plasma orbs: Between 1 metre and 5 metres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Dr. Eamon Ansboro has spent the last three decades gathering data on UAPs. His research has been published in various scientific journals and has gained significant attention, including a paper that received 150,000 reads by scientists two years ago. He established an observatory in Kingsland, near Boyle, to further investigate aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Dr. Ansboro has reported a high frequency of plasma orbs in the Lough Key area, particularly above the lake. His orbital tracking systems enable him to predict when these orbs may appear, with Saturday's event presenting a strong opportunity for sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Usually when they happen in Lough Key, they happen above the lake and they come in different flavours. We have shown that there is a DNA connection here - it's a living sort of system in itself. It's intelligent. That's all we know,”</blockquote>
<p>— Dr. Eamon Ansboro, speaking on Ros FM Radio.</p>

<blockquote>“This is not just about proving their intelligence but it may lead us to the next step. We need to be looking into the communications because who are the pilots behind all this? If you have pilots behind this, they're intelligent,”</blockquote>
<p>— Dr. Eamon Ansboro, on the potential implications of his research.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UFOs and UAPs has grown significantly in recent years, with numerous reports and studies emerging globally. Dr. Ansboro’s work adds to the body of research that seeks to understand these phenomena, particularly the patterns of sightings in specific locations like Lough Key.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The skywatch event will take place as planned on Saturday evening, providing an opportunity for attendees to observe potential UAPs in the skies above Boyle. Dr. Ansboro continues to pursue further research and communication efforts regarding intelligent life in space.</p>
