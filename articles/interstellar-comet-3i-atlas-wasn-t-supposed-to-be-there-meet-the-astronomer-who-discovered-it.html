      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Discovered by Astronomer Larry Denneau</h2>

<p>Dr. Larry Denneau of the University of Hawaii has discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS while reviewing data from telescopes on July 1, 2025. This significant finding marks the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is important as it enhances understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. Following the detection, astronomers from various institutions confirmed its orbit, indicating it is not gravitationally bound to the sun and originates from outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered by:</strong> Dr. Larry Denneau, University of Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Third known interstellar object</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar objects:</strong> 1I/'Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Project:</strong> ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Dr. Larry Denneau reviewed data from the ATLAS project when he first encountered 3I/ATLAS. Initially, it appeared to be a typical near-Earth object. After submitting the data, he was offline for a day, unaware of the growing excitement about the discovery. Upon returning, he found numerous emails regarding the object, which was soon classified by the Minor Planets Center.</p>

<p>Within a day, telescopes across the globe confirmed the comet's unusual trajectory, indicating it was not bound to the sun. Follow-up observations were coordinated with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to confirm its orbit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was literally the person who clicked the button and submitted the discovery observations for this object,” said Dr. Larry Denneau.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“All of the orbit fits turned out to be really poor. They didn’t look like the solar system — they had this funny trajectory that said it’s going really fast. It's not bound to the sun,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects are rare and provide valuable information about the formation of planetary systems beyond our own. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the limited knowledge astronomers have about these celestial bodies, which come from other stars and are only briefly visible as they pass through the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Follow-up observations will continue as astronomers gather more data on 3I/ATLAS. The ongoing analysis of its trajectory and characteristics will contribute to understanding the nature and origins of interstellar comets.</p>
