      <h2>NASA Releases New 3I/Atlas Images - It's Coming From Mars to Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, showcasing its structure and behaviour as it travels through our solar system. The images were made public on October 10, 2023, and highlight the comet's coma and its trails of gas and dust. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it provides new insights into the materials and processes of comets formed in other star systems. NASA continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS using various spacecraft and telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), to gather more data about this rare interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in 2019.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to Earth in mid-December 2025, at a distance of about 167 million miles (269 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>The comet passed within approximately 19 million miles (30 million kilometres) of Mars in October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA has used multiple spacecraft, including the Lucy spacecraft, to gather data on the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is not gravitationally bound to the Sun and follows a hyperbolic trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2019, and its unique journey has captured the attention of astronomers. In October 2025, the comet made a close pass by Mars, allowing for detailed observations. Shortly thereafter, NASA released the latest images, revealing the comet's coma and tail.</p>

<p>As of now, NASA and other agencies are actively tracking the comet's behaviour and composition as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a rare messenger from another star system,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Its journey offers a unique opportunity to study materials that predate our Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the few comets that is not bound to the Sun, making it a unique subject of study for scientists. Previous observations of comets have provided insights into the early solar system, and 3I/ATLAS may yield further information about the formation of comets elsewhere in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. After its December 2025 flyby, the comet is expected to head back into interstellar space, never to return.</p>
