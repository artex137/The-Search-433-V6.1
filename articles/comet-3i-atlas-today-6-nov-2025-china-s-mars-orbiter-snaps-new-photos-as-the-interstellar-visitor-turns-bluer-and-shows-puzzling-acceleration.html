      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Observed by China’s Mars Orbiter</h2>
<p>China’s Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter has photographed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, approximately 30 million kilometres away, during its early October pass by Mars. The images, along with a brief animation, were released on November 6, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides a closer look at the comet, which has shown unusual behaviour, including a shift in colour towards blue and signs of non-gravitational acceleration. Researchers are investigating these phenomena to better understand the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: Early October 2025, with images released on November 6.</li>
    <li>Distance from the comet during observation: ~30 million km.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is classified as the third known interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred around October 30, 2025, at approximately 1.4 AU.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, at about 1.8 AU (approximately 270 million km).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October 2025, the Tianwen-1 orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS during its close pass by Mars. The observation was planned in early September. The comet reached perihelion around October 30, 2025, and has recently re-emerged for ground observers after solar conjunction.</p>
<p>On November 5, the Virtual Telescope Project shared new images of the comet. Reports on November 6 revealed the comet's colour shift and signs of acceleration, prompting further investigation by researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observation serves as a technical pathfinder for future small-body missions,” said a spokesperson from China’s space agency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The bluish turn and non-gravitational push are precisely the kinds of anomalies that interstellar visitors are expected to surface,” noted a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its behaviour, including the recent colour changes and acceleration, has drawn attention from the scientific community, as such anomalies could provide insights into the nature of interstellar comets.</p>
<p>NASA has classified the comet as posing no danger to Earth, and it is being studied across multiple space missions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyse the data from Tianwen-1 and other missions, including calls for NASA to release additional images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Observations will allow astronomers to track the comet's brightness and behaviour as it approaches Earth in December.</p>
