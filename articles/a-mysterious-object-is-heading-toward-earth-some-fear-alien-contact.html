      <h2>A mysterious object is heading toward Earth — some fear alien contact</h2>

<p>A newly confirmed interstellar comet, dubbed 3I/ATLAS, is racing through the inner solar system and is expected to reach perihelion around October 30, 2025. The object was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey and confirmed by the Minor Planet Center the following day. No injuries or fatalities have been reported regarding this celestial event.</p>

<p>This comet matters to scientists as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Authorities are monitoring its trajectory closely, as it poses no threat to Earth. Observations will be limited due to its proximity to the Sun, but scientists expect to resume observations in early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS survey</li>
    <li>Confirmed by Minor Planet Center on July 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Expected perihelion on October 30, 2025, at approximately 1.4 AU from the Sun</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth projected for late December 2025</li>
    <li>Near pass to Mars on October 2, 2025, at about 30 million km</li>
    <li>Estimated size in the few-to-several-mile range</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey. The following day, it was confirmed by the Minor Planet Center. As of now, it has been classified as an interstellar comet, and scientists have indicated that it will safely pass through the inner solar system.</p>

<p>The comet will reach perihelion on October 30, 2025. Observations will be limited until early December when it will be possible to study it more closely as it moves further from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a fascinating natural visitor that will pass safely through the inner solar system,” said a NASA representative. “The closer it gets, the more we’ll learn about its chemistry and origins.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, noted that “the most likely outcome is a perfectly natural interstellar object.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous interstellar objects have sparked curiosity and speculation about their origins and nature, with some suggesting they could be artificial. However, standard celestial mechanics indicate a hyperbolic trajectory consistent with natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, astronomers will refine their observations to learn more about its composition and behavior. Investigations will continue to clarify its size and activity, which could inform future mission designs for studying interstellar objects.</p>
