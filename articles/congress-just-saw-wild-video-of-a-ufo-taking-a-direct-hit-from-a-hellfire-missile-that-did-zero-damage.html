      <h2>Congress Sees Video of UFO Unscathed by Missile Strike</h2>

<p>Three Navy and Air Force veterans have testified before Congress on October 30, 2024, presenting a video of a UFO being struck by a Hellfire missile from a US military drone. The congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) took place on Capitol Hill, marking the third such hearing in 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This video has raised significant discussions about the nature of UAPs and the efficacy of military weaponry against them. Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri shared the footage, which shows the missile bouncing off the unidentified object, which continued its trajectory off the coast of Yemen. This has prompted inquiries into the government’s handling of UAP incidents and the testimonies of the whistleblowers involved.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of video: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Type of missile: Hellfire missile, approximately 100 pounds (45 kg)</li>
    <li>Testifying veterans: Jeffrey Nuccetelli (former Air Force military police), Dylan Borland (former Air Force geospatial intelligence specialist)</li>
    <li>Congressional hearing: Third hearing on UAPs in 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a US military drone launched a Hellfire missile at a UFO. The congressional hearing occurred shortly after, where the video evidence was presented. Testimonies from veterans highlighted their experiences and the challenges they faced in sharing their knowledge about UAPs.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Nuccetelli described the video as "exceptional evidence" of UFO existence. Borland claimed he faced retaliation from multiple government agencies for attempting to disclose information about UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This video provides evidence that challenges our understanding of UAPs and military capabilities,” said Congressman Eric Burlison during the hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I have witnessed extraordinary phenomena that have been suppressed,” stated Jeffrey Nuccetelli.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UAPs, commonly referred to as UFOs, have garnered increasing attention over the past few years, leading to congressional hearings aimed at understanding their existence and implications. Previous incidents involving military encounters with UAPs have raised questions about national security and the effectiveness of military technology.</p>

<p>Veterans' testimonies at these hearings have often highlighted concerns about government transparency and the treatment of individuals who report UAP sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the incidents involving UAPs are expected as Congress continues to review military protocols and the handling of whistleblower testimonies. Additional hearings may be scheduled to address these pressing issues.</p>
