      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS displays oscillating jets in rare Sun-facing anti-tail</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), has exhibited unusual oscillating jets as it approaches interstellar space, following its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet passed approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth during this event.</p>

<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS are significant for astronomers as they provide insights into the comet's behavior and composition, especially since it is the first time this object, formed around another star, experiences solar heating in our solar system. NASA has coordinated multiple space missions to monitor the comet and gather data from various angles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, approximately 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Oscillating jets observed over 37 nights from July to September 2025.</li>
    <li>The anti-tail structure has reached around 1 million kilometers in extent.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass close to Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile. After passing perihelion on October 30, 2025, the comet continued to be monitored, revealing oscillating jets and an anti-tail structure. Observations conducted over 37 nights from July to September 2025 provided data on the comet's rotation and activity.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to Earth. Following this, astronomers have continued to track the object in the pre-dawn sky. The Parker Solar Probe captured daily images of the comet between October and November 2025, while the Europa Clipper observed it from a distance in November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The oscillating jets and the anti-tail structure provide a unique opportunity to study the behavior of an interstellar comet in our solar environment,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being an interstellar object, allowing scientists to compare its composition with other comets formed in different stellar systems. The comet's activity and the presence of the anti-tail reveal important information about the interactions between solar radiation and interstellar material.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The comet is expected to continue its journey towards interstellar space, with astronomers planning ongoing monitoring as long as it remains visible. The approach to Jupiter in March 2026 will provide additional observational opportunities.</p>
