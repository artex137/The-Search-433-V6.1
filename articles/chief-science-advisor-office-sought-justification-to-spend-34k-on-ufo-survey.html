      <h2>Chief science advisor office sought justification to spend $34K on UFO survey</h2>

<p>The office of Chief Science Advisor Mona Nemer has sought justification for spending over $34,000 on a survey about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that was not requested by any parliamentarian. Internal memos from 2024, disclosed through access-to-information records, raise questions about government spending priorities.</p>

<p>This survey is significant as it reflects the government's attempt to address public concerns about disinformation and conspiracy theories regarding UFOs. Nemer's office instructed staff to provide a rationale for the survey, aligning it with federal public opinion research objectives amid a cabinet commitment to reduce unnecessary expenditures.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Amount spent: <strong>$34,369</strong></li>
    <li>Polling firm: Earnscliffe Strategy Group</li>
    <li>Surveyed individuals: 1,008 Canadians</li>
    <li>Percentage of Canadians who reported seeing an unidentified object: <strong>27%</strong></li>
    <li>Percentage that reported sightings to authorities: <strong>10%</strong></li>
    <li>Top provinces for reported sightings: British Columbia (32%), Ontario (29%)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to the records, the research was initiated solely within the Chief Science Advisor’s office. Staff were directed to justify the need for the survey, emphasizing its alignment with broader research goals.</p>
<p>Despite internal uncertainties, the office proceeded to pay for the survey, which was conducted by Earnscliffe Strategy Group. The findings revealed a low level of public support for federal spending on UFO investigations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Elaborate on the justification for why the survey is needed,” staff wrote in the memo.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Support for actual public spending on unidentified aerial phenomenon investigation is not strong,” the pollsters concluded.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The survey results indicate that Canadians have a “limited degree of real alarm” regarding UFOs. Only <strong>10%</strong> of respondents strongly agreed that unidentified aerial phenomena pose a flight safety issue in Canada. This sentiment suggests a disconnect between government initiatives and public interest in UFO investigations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no disclosed plans for further investigations or actions related to the survey's findings. The Chief Science Advisor's office may need to reassess its approach to public engagement regarding UFOs and related spending.</p>
