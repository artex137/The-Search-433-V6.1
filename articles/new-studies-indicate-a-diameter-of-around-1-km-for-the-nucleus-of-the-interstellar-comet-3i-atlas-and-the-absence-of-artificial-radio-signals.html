      <h2>New studies indicate a diameter of around 1 km for the nucleus of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS and the absence of artificial radio signals</h2>

<p>Scientists have released new findings on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, indicating that its nucleus has a diameter of approximately 1 kilometer. The studies, conducted with the Allen Telescope Array in July 2025, did not detect any artificial radio signals associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it reinforces the natural characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed object from outside the Solar System. Authorities, including NASA, are using these findings to refine their understanding of interstellar objects and to enhance monitoring efforts for future celestial visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Diameter of the comet's nucleus is estimated between 820 meters and 1,050 meters.</li>
    <li>Radio observations were conducted over 7.25 hours on July 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>No artificial radio signals were detected during the observations.</li>
    <li>Radiated power limits were established between 10 and 110 watts in the 1 to 9 GHz range.</li>
    <li>Follow-up observations in December 2025 further reduced the power limit to 0.1 watts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025. Initial observations conducted by the Allen Telescope Array took place on July 2, 2025, focusing on radio emissions. The results showed no narrowband signals coinciding with the comet's position after filtering for interference.</p>
<p>In December 2025, additional observations with the Green Bank Telescope tightened the limits on potential radio emissions. This analysis established an upper limit of radiated power and confirmed the absence of artificial signals.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations reinforce typical features of comets, such as cometary activity and diffuse coma,” said a lead researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These discoveries have prompted increased interest in studying the characteristics and origins of such celestial bodies. The absence of artificial signals in the latest findings sets a precedent for future searches for technosignatures.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. Future observations with advanced telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, may provide further insights into the comet's velocity and composition.</p>
