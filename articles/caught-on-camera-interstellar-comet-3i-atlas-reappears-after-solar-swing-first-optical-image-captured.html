      <h2>Caught on camera: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reappears after solar swing — first optical image captured</h2>

<p>Astronomers at Arizona’s Lowell Observatory have captured what is believed to be the first optical image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after it swung around the Sun, reaching perihelion on October 29. The comet, which is travelling through the solar system at over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h), was imaged by the 4.3-metre Discovery Telescope. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever recorded. Researchers and amateur astronomers have continued to monitor its trajectory using data from space telescopes while the comet was obscured. Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at the observatory, has indicated that the comet is visible through small amateur telescopes across much of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29, 2023, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units (130 million miles or 210 million kilometres) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at more than 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>The first optical image was captured by the Lowell Discovery Telescope.</li>
    <li>Qicheng Zhang has indicated that the comet can be observed with small amateur instruments.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to become increasingly visible in the coming days.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. On October 28, Qicheng Zhang and a colleague posted a study to the preprint server arXiv, suggesting that the comet underwent rapid brightening ahead of perihelion. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, after which the first optical image was captured. Observations are expected to continue as the comet moves away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All you need is a clear sky and a very low eastern horizon,” Zhang told Live Science on November 2. “It won’t look very impressive, it’s just a smudge, but it will be an increasingly visible smudge over the next few days.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The comet is rapidly rising from the sun,” Zhang said. “I think in one week it’s going to be something like 25 or 30 degrees away from the sun, by which point there will be a large number of other big telescopes around the world that will also be able to start to follow it up.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects have been recorded. This comet is noted to be approximately 3 billion years older than the solar system, and its prolonged exposure to space radiation has created an irradiated crust, complicating its origin. Despite some media speculation regarding its nature, astronomers largely consider it a typical comet from another star system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists expect an important observation period as the sublimation of surface ice may reveal more about the comet’s composition. Further data is required to confirm its brightness changes as it recedes from the Sun.</p>
