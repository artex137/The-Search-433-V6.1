      <h2>Congress UFO hearing over Hellfire missile video raises questions about military safety and government secrecy</h2>

<p>A Congress hearing on September 9th has raised alarms about military safety and government transparency after lawmakers viewed a video showing a Hellfire missile striking a mysterious object over Yemen. The footage, presented by Republican Eric Burlison, depicted the missile making contact with the object, which did not explode or change course, leaving many questions unanswered. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the incident shown in the video.</p>

<p>The hearing has sparked renewed public and media interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities, including Navy Chief Alexandro Wiggins and Air Force veterans, have voiced concerns about the lack of available information regarding UAP sightings. Whistleblowers have reported fearing retaliation for speaking out, which has contributed to a growing demand for transparency from the military and government regarding UAP encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: U.S. Congress</li>
    <li>Video date: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Presenters: Navy Chief Alexandro Wiggins, Air Force veterans, journalist George Knapp</li>
    <li>Key video content: Hellfire missile striking a glowing object over Yemen</li>
    <li>Reported incidents of retaliation against whistleblowers: Yes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 9, 2024, the U.S. Congress held a hearing focused on UAP sightings. During the session, a video from October 30, 2024, was shown, depicting a Hellfire missile launched from an MQ-9 Reaper drone striking an unidentified object over Yemen. The object reportedly continued moving without any visible damage, raising significant concerns among lawmakers.</p>

<p>George Knapp, alongside his colleague Jeremy Corbell, testified that numerous similar videos exist but have not been shared with Congress or the public. The hearing highlighted the ongoing secrecy surrounding UAP incidents and the implications for military safety.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There are servers holding whole banks of these videos, but neither Congress nor the public has been allowed to see them,” said journalist George Knapp during the hearing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon's history of silence on UAP matters has contributed to speculation about the technology and knowledge it possesses. A report by former Pentagon analyst Matthew Brown, titled "Immaculate Constellation," has detailed a secret information quarantine on UFOs dating back to the Cold War, which continues to this day. This has led to calls for reform and greater transparency regarding military encounters with unidentified objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As pressure mounts for disclosure, investigations into the military's handling of UAP footage may increase. The demand for transparency from the public and Congress is likely to continue, especially with the emergence of new videos and accounts from whistleblowers.</p>
