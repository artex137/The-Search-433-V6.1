      <h2>TESS Spotted 3I/ATLAS Two Months Before It Was Discovered</h2>

<p>A new analysis has shown that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was visible in data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) as early as May 7, 2025, two months prior to its official discovery in July 2025. The object was also found to have been “active” during that time, according to researchers from Michigan State University and Auburn University.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it highlights the capability of existing telescopes to capture data on celestial objects before they are officially recognized. Researchers Adina Feinstein, Darryl Seligman, and John Noonan analyzed TESS data to uncover these early observations, which can provide insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Early observations of the comet were detected starting May 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's distance from the Sun decreased from 6.35 AU to 5.47 AU between May 7 and June 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>During this period, its brightness increased by a factor of 5.</li>
    <li>The increase in brightness is attributed to the outgassing of hypervolatile materials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 7, 2025, TESS captured images of 3I/ATLAS, which were later analyzed by researchers. The team employed a technique called “shift-stacking” to compile images taken every 200 seconds, allowing them to track the comet's movement and activity.</p>
<p>By June 2, 2025, the comet had moved closer to the Sun, resulting in a significant increase in brightness. This increase was noted as being unusual for comets in our solar system, suggesting different compositions between interstellar comets and those bound to our solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This paper adds to the corpus of knowledge we have about interstellar objects,” said Adina Feinstein, one of the researchers involved in the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar objects, following the earlier detections of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These findings indicate that comets from other solar systems may have compositions that differ significantly from those in our own solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue analyzing existing data from various telescopes to unlock further mysteries surrounding interstellar objects. This ongoing investigation may provide more insights into the behavior and characteristics of comets like 3I/ATLAS.</p>
