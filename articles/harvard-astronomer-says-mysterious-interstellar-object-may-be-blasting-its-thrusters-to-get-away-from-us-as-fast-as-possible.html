      <h2>Harvard Astronomer Says Mysterious Interstellar Object May Be Blasting Its Thrusters to Get Away From Us as Fast as Possible</h2>

<p>Mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has reemerged from behind the Sun, allowing astronomers to observe the rare visitor once again. The object, believed to be a comet predominantly made of carbon dioxide ice, is expected to make its closest approach to Earth just days before Christmas as it exits our solar system. New images taken by the Nordic Optical Telescope on the Canary Islands show 3I/ATLAS largely intact after its perihelion passage, contrary to earlier hypotheses of its breakup.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has suggested that the object might possess thrusters, potentially indicating it is a technological spacecraft attempting to accelerate away from the Sun. This theory, though met with skepticism from some in the scientific community, has sparked interest in the implications of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Earth: December 2023</li>
    <li>Latest images taken by: Nordic Optical Telescope, Canary Islands</li>
    <li>Surface area estimate: Diameter of 23 kilometers (14.3 miles)</li>
    <li>Hypothesized composition: Predominantly carbon dioxide ice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2023, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope first captured images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing an appendage known as an “anti-tail.” This feature grew in length leading up to its perihelion.</p>
<p>On September 29, Pennsylvania State University astronomer Jason Wright refuted claims about the uniqueness of the anti-tail, citing previous observations of similar phenomena in other comets.</p>
<p>As of early December 2023, new images confirm 3I/ATLAS has survived its closest approach to the Sun without breaking apart.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Technological thrusters which point their exhaust towards the Sun would accelerate away from the Sun. This post-perihelion maneuver might be employed by a spacecraft that aims to gain speed rather than slow down through the gravitational assist from the Sun.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb added, “The foundation of science is the curiosity, the humility to learn. Let’s just wait a few more weeks, we’ll figure it out, and let’s hope that there will be no gifts from this object for the holidays on Earth.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader dialogue in the scientific community about the potential for extraterrestrial technology. While many experts believe the object is a natural comet, Loeb’s theories have reignited interest in the search for alien life.</p>
<p>Previous studies have documented similar phenomena in other comets, contributing to ongoing debates about the nature of interstellar objects and their behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest pass to Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. Further observations may provide additional insights into the object’s composition and characteristics.</p>
