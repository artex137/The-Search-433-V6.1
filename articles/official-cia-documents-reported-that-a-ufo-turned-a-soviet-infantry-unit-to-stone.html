      <h2>Official CIA documents reported that a UFO turned a Soviet infantry unit to stone</h2>

<p>A document released by the CIA has detailed an extraordinary incident involving a Soviet infantry unit that was allegedly attacked by a UFO in Siberia during a training exercise. The incident reportedly resulted in 23 soldiers being turned into stone-like structures. The document, part of a larger release of military and intelligence files, has garnered significant attention since its disclosure in 2025.</p>

<p>This revelation comes as part of President Donald Trump’s order to declassify and release information regarding UFOs. The report, which cites a KGB file obtained after the Soviet Union's collapse, raises questions about the nature of the event and the potential implications for understanding unidentified aerial phenomena. Authorities have not commented on the validity of the claims made in the document.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred during a training exercise in Siberia.</li>
    <li>23 soldiers reportedly turned into "stone poles" after a UFO explosion.</li>
    <li>Document received attention in 2025 following declassification orders.</li>
    <li>Document claims to be based on a 250-page KGB file from the early 1990s.</li>
    <li>UFO described as a “quite low-flying spaceship in the shape of a saucer.”</li>
    <li>Two soldiers survived the incident by taking cover behind trees.</li>
    <li>Molecular analysis suggested the soldiers' structures were similar to limestone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the early 1990s, a KGB file detailing the incident was created and subsequently archived.</p>
<p>In 1993, a Ukrainian newspaper, Ternopil Vechirny, published a story based on the KGB documents.</p>
<p>In 2000, the CIA cleared the report for release, but it remained largely unnoticed until President Trump’s declassification order in 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Specialists assume that a source of energy that is still unknown to earthlings instantly changed the structure of the soldiers’ living organisms,” the KGB report states.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The CIA has never commented on the report,” according to intelligence sources.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The incident reportedly involved a UFO that appeared above a Soviet infantry unit, leading to an unusual response from one of the soldiers who fired a missile at the craft. This event is part of a broader interest in UFOs, particularly following the declassification of military documents in recent years. The credibility of such reports often fluctuates, with many being based on anecdotal evidence or local news sources.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are no current investigations into the claims made in the report, and the status of the alleged petrified soldiers remains unclear. Further analysis of the document and its implications for understanding UFO phenomena may be warranted, but no official next steps have been announced. </p>
