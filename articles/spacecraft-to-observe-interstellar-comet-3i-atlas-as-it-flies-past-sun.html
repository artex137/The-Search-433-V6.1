      <h2>Spacecraft to observe interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it flies past Sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is currently flying through our Solar System and will soon become invisible from Earth as it moves to the opposite side of the Sun. According to BBC Sky at Night Magazine, this trajectory means the comet will not be visible to Earth-based telescopes until early December 2025.</p>

<p>This observation window is significant for astronomers, as they believe the comet will be most active during its invisible trajectory. To study 3I/ATLAS during this time, scientists plan to utilize existing spacecraft at Mars, Jupiter, and the Sun to gather data on the comet's activity. Insights gained could provide valuable information about the comet's origins, potentially linking it to the Milky Way galaxy's 'thick disk' and 'cosmic noon.'</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently flying through our Solar System.</li>
    <li>The comet will be invisible from Earth until early December 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Mars is expected to occur at approximately 30 million km on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Emirates Mars Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EMUS) and the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) will be used for observations.</li>
    <li>ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will observe 3I/ATLAS between November 2 and November 25, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, significant observations are planned:</p>
<ul>
    <li>October 1-7, 2025: Mars orbiters Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will observe 3I/ATLAS as it passes near Mars.</li>
    <li>October 3, 2025: Closest distance between the comet and the Mars orbiters is expected to be approximately 30 million km.</li>
    <li>November 2-25, 2025: ESA's JUICE will observe the comet during its perihelion, the closest approach to the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "JUICE will be in the best position for the important period around the 3I/ATLAS perihelion, when observations from Earth will be the hardest," stated T. Marshall Eubanks, Chief Scientist at Space Initiatives Inc.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS is crucial for understanding the formation of planetary systems in our galaxy. Previous encounters with interstellar comets have provided insights into their composition, potentially revealing whether they share building blocks with comets formed within our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will rely on various spacecraft to gather data during its invisible phase. Observations in 2025 are expected to yield insights into the comet's chemical makeup and activity, which could enhance our understanding of interstellar materials.</p>
