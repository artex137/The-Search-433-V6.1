      <h2>Newly Examined Records Suggest 'MAJESTIC' Was Less About Aliens Attacking and More About Managing Truth</h2>

<p>Newly examined records have revealed that the MAJESTIC plan, drafted in 1952, focused more on managing public belief than on defending against potential alien threats. The plan emerged amid a national UFO panic, with a significant increase in reported sightings by military and civilian observers. The Pentagon commissioned this emergency war plan, which became known as MAJESTIC, to address growing concerns about unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>The MAJESTIC plan is significant as it highlights the U.S. military's approach to psychological operations and information control during a time of uncertainty. Authorities are now scrutinizing these records to understand the implications for current government transparency and public trust regarding unidentified flying objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>MAJESTIC plan drafted in 1952 during a national UFO panic.</li>
    <li>Commissioned by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, effective from July 1, 1952.</li>
    <li>Plan focuses on psychological operations and public narrative management.</li>
    <li>Only five pages of the plan were partially declassified in 1976.</li>
    <li>Plan includes strict reporting rules and verification processes.</li>
    <li>Absence of references to nuclear strikes or conventional troop movements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 1952, reports of strange objects in U.S. airspace surged, prompting concerns within the Pentagon. On July 1, 1952, the Joint Chiefs of Staff finalized the MAJESTIC emergency war plan. Following its completion, Washington DC experienced significant UFO sightings, leading to radar alerts and military responses over consecutive weekends.</p>

<p>By the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy began inquiring about classified UFO programs, which included MAJESTIC. This raised alarms within the CIA, particularly for Director Allen Dulles, who responded with directives emphasizing psychological warfare and public manipulation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If the plan truly focused on psychological operations rather than defence, then the perceived threat was not alien hostility but public awareness.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The MAJESTIC plan represents a shift in Cold War strategies, highlighting the importance of managing public perception as a key component of national security. Similar tactics have been observed in later government policies regarding information control and public narrative management.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to investigate the implications of the MAJESTIC plan and its relevance to current UFO disclosure policies. Further examination of the declassified documents may shed light on the government's approach to public communication regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
