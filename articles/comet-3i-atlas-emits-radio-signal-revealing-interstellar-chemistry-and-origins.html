      <h2>Comet 3I Atlas Emits Radio Signal, Revealing Interstellar Chemistry and Origins</h2>

<p>On October 24, 2025, astronomers detected the first radio signal from the interstellar comet 3I Atlas using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. The telescope captured absorption lines of hydroxyl radicals at frequencies of 1,665 GHz and 1,667 GHz, marking a significant advancement in the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the comet's chemical composition and origins, according to experts. The detection of hydroxyl radicals signals the release of ancient ice from the comet's core as it approaches the Sun, offering a glimpse into the conditions of distant star systems. Scientists have noted that this finding is pivotal for understanding the differences between local and interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of detection: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of detection: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li>Frequencies measured: 1,665 GHz and 1,667 GHz</li>
    <li>Comet's speed: approximately 30 km/s</li>
    <li>Minimum distance to Earth: 270 million kilometers on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Diameter of the comet's nucleus: between 3 and 11 kilometers</li>
    <li>Next close approach to Jupiter: March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The journey of 3I Atlas began millions of years ago when it was ejected from its original star system, traveling through interstellar space. The comet was discovered by the ATLAS project in Chile in July 2025. It approached the Sun, undergoing sublimation due to solar heat, and on October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT telescope detected radio signals indicating the presence of hydroxyl radicals.</p>

<p>During its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, the comet exhibited intensified sublimation and a significant ion tail. Observations revealed fluctuations in brightness and an anti-tail, captivating astronomers worldwide. The James Webb Space Telescope provided additional infrared data, complementing the radio observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of hydroxyl signals from 3I Atlas represents a major leap for radio astronomy,” said a spokesperson from the MeerKAT project. “This breakthrough underscores the need for continued investment in radio astronomy and global cooperation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I Atlas is notable for its non-gravitational acceleration, driven by jets of vaporized gas. Compared to previous interstellar comets like ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, 3I Atlas displays greater jet activity and significant changes in brightness. This comet serves as a valuable example of how interstellar objects differ from those found in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA’s Juno probe is set to capture low-frequency radio emissions from 3I Atlas in March 2026 as it passes near Jupiter. Ground-based telescopes will continue to monitor the comet, while future research aims to detect hydrogen line emissions at 1,420 MHz for enhanced trajectory analysis. This ongoing study promises to deepen understanding of interstellar visitors and their origins.</p>
