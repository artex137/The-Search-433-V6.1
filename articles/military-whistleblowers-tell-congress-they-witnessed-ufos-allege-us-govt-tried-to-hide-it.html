      <h2>Military Whistleblowers Tell Congress They Witnessed UFOs, Allege US Govt Tried To Hide It</h2>

<p>A group of US military whistleblowers has testified under oath before Congress that they have witnessed unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and alleged that the US intelligence community has attempted to conceal this information. The testimony took place on Wednesday during the third congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), a term adopted for UFOs in 2023.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it aims to address concerns regarding transparency in the US government's handling of UAP sightings. Lawmakers are seeking to uncover the extent of military engagement with these phenomena and the implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Whistleblowers include three Navy and Air Force veterans.</li>
    <li>The hearing occurred on September 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Congressman Eric Burlison presented a video showing a UAP being struck by a Hellfire missile.</li>
    <li>The incident involving the missile strike occurred on October 30, 2024.</li>
    <li>The missile, a 100-pound air-to-ground precision weapon, reportedly failed to disable the UAP.</li>
    <li>The UAP continued traveling at high speed off the coast of Yemen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a US military drone, specifically an MQ-9 Reaper, engaged a UAP with a Hellfire missile. During the congressional hearing on September 9, 2025, Congressman Eric Burlison showcased footage of this incident, which revealed the missile striking the unidentified object without effect.</p>

<p>The whistleblowers, comprising former military personnel, provided their accounts of UAP sightings, raising questions about government transparency and the military's response to such phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The U.S. military appears to have authorized military engagement against a UAP,” said Congressman Burlison during the hearing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing is part of a broader effort by Congress to investigate UAPs and the military's engagement with them. In recent years, there has been increasing public interest and concern regarding the government's transparency about UFO sightings and encounters.</p>

<p>The shift to using the term UAP reflects a more formal approach to addressing these phenomena, as authorities continue to evaluate the implications for national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue its investigations into UAP sightings and the military's responses. Further hearings and inquiries may be scheduled to gather more information and assess potential policy changes regarding UAP engagement.</p>
