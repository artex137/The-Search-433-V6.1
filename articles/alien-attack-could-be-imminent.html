      <h2>Alien attack could be imminent</h2>

<p>A Harvard astrophysicist has warned that a mysterious interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft poised to reach Earth’s orbit by late October 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This warning has raised public interest and concern regarding the object, which was first detected on July 1, 2025. While NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University has suggested it may present a risk, potentially marking a significant event in the study of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First detected: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated size: Equivalent to Manhattan</li>
    <li>Estimated weight: 33 billion tonnes</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Possible Earth approach: Between November 21 and December 5, 2025</li>
    <li>Composition: Emits four grams of nickel per second, no iron detected</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025. Since that time, astronomers have been monitoring its trajectory as it approaches the inner solar system. On October 29, it is expected to reach its closest point to the sun. Professor Loeb has indicated that this date could coincide with a potential “strike date” for the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It may come to save us or destroy us. If you want to take a vacation, take it before that date [October 29]. Because who knows what will happen.” 
    — Professor Avi Loeb, Harvard University
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is a natural interstellar comet and an exciting discovery in its own right.” 
    — Chris Lintott, Oxford University astronomer
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will pass safely through the inner solar system.” 
    — NASA statement
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Professor Loeb has gained attention for his unconventional theories about alien technology. His claims regarding 3I/ATLAS have been met with skepticism from the scientific community, particularly from experts like Chris Lintott, who emphasize the importance of understanding the object as a natural phenomenon. NASA's assurance of safety reflects ongoing efforts to manage public perception of potential extraterrestrial threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition. Further studies are expected to clarify its nature and any potential implications for future research on extraterrestrial life.</p>
