      <h2>3I/ATLAS Near-Sun Mystery Deepens — Interstellar Visitor Behaves Like No Known Comet</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest among astronomers as it continues to display unexpected behaviour after passing near the Sun. The comet’s unusual speed, trajectory, and composition have raised questions about its origin and its potential age, with some experts suggesting it may predate our Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery is important because it challenges existing theories about the evolution of cosmic matter. NASA and several international space agencies have increased monitoring of 3I/ATLAS to better understand its behaviour and trajectory as it travels through the inner Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in 2023.</li>
    <li>It has exhibited acceleration and brightness contrary to typical comet behaviour.</li>
    <li>NASA has activated a temporary observation and defence protocol.</li>
    <li>The comet is suspected to have originated from beyond our Solar System.</li>
    <li>Its materials may date back over seven billion years.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS remains visible through powerful telescopes in low light pollution areas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in early 2023, drawing initial comparisons to traditional comets. As it approached the Sun, scientists noted its unexpected acceleration and brightening rather than disintegration. NASA began monitoring its trajectory closely as it altered its course after swinging around the Sun.</p>
<p>Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have indicated that the comet’s materials could be older than Earth, prompting further investigation into its origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The glow from 3I/ATLAS has not resulted from typical solar heating. Instead, it seems to release vast quantities of trapped gas and ice beneath its crust,” NASA officials stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS differs significantly from other known comets, such as Oumuamua, which sparked debates regarding its nature. The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into the formation of comets and the early conditions of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it travels back into deep space. They aim to gather more data on its composition and behaviour before it moves beyond detection range.</p>
