      <h2>3I/ATLAS races towards Earth: Here is when it will make its closest approach as NASA and ESA observe a hyperactive comet</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is moving towards Earth and will make its closest approach on December 19, 2023, at a distance of 275 million kilometres. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have both been observing the comet, which has shown increased activity following its encounter with the Sun in late October.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a unique opportunity for scientists to study the characteristics of an interstellar object. Both NASA and ESA have deployed spacecraft to monitor 3I/ATLAS, with new images released that highlight its brightness and activity level. The data collected will aid in understanding the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 275 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 210,000 km/hr</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 1,400 feet long and 5.6 km wide</li>
    <li><strong>Imaging agency:</strong> NASA and ESA</li>
    <li><strong>Recent imaging date:</strong> November 30, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation since its discovery. The comet exhibited increased activity after its perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, in late October. NASA captured images of the comet on November 30, revealing a bright halo around its coma.</p>
<p>ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) probe also provided images of the comet, focusing on its gas and dust plume. These images were transmitted at a slow rate due to the spacecraft's need to protect its equipment from solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Not only do we clearly see the glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet known as its coma, we also see a hint of two tails,” an ESA spokesperson stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor to enter the solar system. Its approach offers scientists a chance to study a body from outside our solar system, contributing to our understanding of cometary and interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data from ESA's Juice probe will continue to be transmitted, with a complete image expected to be available in February 2024. Scientists will analyze the information gathered to learn more about the comet's structure and composition.</p>
