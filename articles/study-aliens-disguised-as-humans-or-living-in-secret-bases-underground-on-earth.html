      <h2>Study: Aliens Disguised As Humans Or Living In Secret Bases Underground On Earth</h2>

<p>A recent scholarly article suggests that aliens may be living among humans or concealed in secret underground bases on Earth. The study, coauthored by Montana Technological University professor Michael Masters and Harvard researchers Tim Lomas and Brendan Case, proposes that these extraterrestrial beings could be remnants of an ancient civilization or even time-travelers from the future. The article has sparked renewed interest in the ongoing investigations into unidentified flying objects (UFOs).</p>

<p>This research is significant as it coincides with the Pentagon's investigation into approximately 1,650 UFO sightings, nearly half of which occurred between May 2023 and June 2024. Military officials have stated that none of these sightings have been confirmed as alien in origin, despite some reports detailing aerial maneuvers that challenge current technological and physical understanding.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study published in mid-July 2023.</li>
    <li>Coauthors include Michael Masters, Tim Lomas, and Brendan Case.</li>
    <li>Pentagon is investigating around 1,650 UFO sightings.</li>
    <li>Close to half of the UFO sightings reported between May 2023 and June 2024.</li>
    <li>Paper was removed from ResearchGate shortly after publication.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In mid-July 2023, a scholarly article theorizing that aliens may be disguised as humans or living underground was published. Shortly after, the paper was taken down from ResearchGate, leading to speculation about a potential cover-up. The Pentagon has since confirmed it is investigating 1,650 UFO sightings, with many occurring in the past year.</p>

<p>Dr. Bill Birnes, an author and UFO researcher, has long claimed that aliens resembling humans have been present on Earth for millions of years. He cites an encounter with a French defense official who allegedly confirmed the presence of extraterrestrials living among humans.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We’re not saying this is right, we’re not saying that this is absolutely 100 percent the case,” said Michael Masters, coauthor of the study.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “They’ve been hiding here ever since,” claimed Dr. Bill Birnes regarding the existence of aliens on Earth.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study adds to a growing body of research and public interest in UFO sightings and potential extraterrestrial life. Previous claims and investigations have often been met with skepticism from the military and scientific communities. The ongoing interest in such phenomena reflects a societal curiosity about the unknown.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Pentagon will continue its investigations into UFO sightings, while researchers like Masters and Birnes may pursue further studies to explore the implications of their findings.</p>
