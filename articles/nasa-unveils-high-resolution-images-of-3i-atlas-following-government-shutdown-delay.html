      <h2>NASA Unveils High-Resolution Images of 3I/ATLAS Following Government Shutdown Delay</h2>

<p>NASA has released high-resolution images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which reached its closest proximity to the Sun, approximately 130 million miles away, around October 30, 2025. This comet, first detected by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in July 2025, has sparked significant scientific interest.</p>

<p>The release of the images comes after an extended government shutdown delayed the dissemination of data related to the comet. The Planetary Defense Coordination Office has assessed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, and NASA officials have highlighted the comet's potential to provide insights into cosmic history.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 130 million miles from the Sun.</li>
    <li>First detected in July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>High-resolution images were captured between late September and October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will approach Jupiter in spring 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA's observational assets include Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and Perseverance Mars Rover.</li>
    <li>The U.S. Department of Defense monitored the comet but determined it poses no national security threat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, NASA’s ATLAS telescope first detected the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Following this, the Planetary Defense Coordination Office conducted an assessment, confirming that the comet poses no threat to Earth. High-resolution images were captured between late September and October 2025, culminating in a virtual event where NASA officials unveiled this visual data.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun. The extended government shutdown delayed the release of information about the comet, which heightened public curiosity and speculation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"This comet is positioned at a distance greater than twice that between Earth and the Sun," said Nicky Fox, Associate Administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Advances in observational technology will likely lead to a rise in the detection of interstellar objects passing through our solar system," said Kelly Fast, NASA’s Acting Planetary Defense Officer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The peculiar characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have made it a subject of considerable scientific intrigue. NASA's investigation of interstellar objects is increasingly relevant as advancements in technology enhance detection capabilities. The collaboration between NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense may yield important insights into both astronomical phenomena and national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in spring 2026 and plans to enhance its observational capabilities through the impending launch of the Near-Earth Object Surveyor mission.</p>
