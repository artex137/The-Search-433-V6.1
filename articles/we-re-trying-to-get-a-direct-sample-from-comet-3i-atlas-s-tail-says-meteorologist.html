      <h2>We're trying to get a 'direct sample' from Comet 3I/ATLAS's tail, says Meteorologist</h2>

<p>Researchers have announced plans to collect samples from the tail of Comet 3I/ATLAS during an upcoming alignment with NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft, which will occur between October 30 and November 6, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This alignment presents a unique opportunity for scientists to gather data on interstellar comets, which remain largely unexplored. The study, detailed on the preprint site arXiv, indicates that the Europa Clipper will encounter charged particles from the comet's ion tail, providing a chance to analyze material from beyond the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: October 30 to November 6, 2025</li>
    <li>Spacecraft: NASA's Europa Clipper</li>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Distance: Approximately four million miles from the comet's central axis</li>
    <li>Additional Spacecraft: Hera, from October 25 to November 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Current visibility: Comet not visible to Earth-based systems</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its perihelion, the closest point to the sun. Between October 30 and November 6, the Europa Clipper spacecraft will align with the comet, allowing researchers to collect samples from its tail. Hera will also be in the vicinity from October 25 to November 1, 2025, but its instruments will not be able to collect ion data.</p>

<p>Researchers have utilized a computer program called 'Tailcatcher' to determine the trajectory of the comet's ions and the necessary positioning for the spacecraft to gather data. The program has calculated that both spacecraft will be positioned within a distance that allows for data collection.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have virtually no data on the interior of interstellar comets and the star systems that formed them,” said Samuel Grant of the Finnish Meteorological Institute, who led the research. “Sampling the tail in this way is the closest we can currently get to a direct sample of such an object, and thus a different part of the galaxy.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered recently, has exhibited a growing tail, with recent reports indicating that water is being expelled from it. The study highlights the importance of understanding interstellar comets, as they can provide insights into the formation of star systems outside our solar system. Current instruments aboard the Europa Clipper have been deemed suitable for this investigation, despite not being specifically designed for interstellar research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers aim to communicate with the mission controllers of the Europa Clipper to ensure the necessary instruments are activated for sampling the ions from the comet's tail. If successful, this will mark the first time experts can collect particles from an interstellar comet.</p>
