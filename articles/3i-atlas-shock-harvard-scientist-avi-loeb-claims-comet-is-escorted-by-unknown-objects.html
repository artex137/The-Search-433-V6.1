      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shock: Harvard Scientist Avi Loeb Claims Comet Is Escorted By Unknown Objects</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention following claims by Harvard scientist Avi Loeb that it may be accompanied by unknown objects. First discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile, the comet has exhibited unusual characteristics regarding its trajectory and tail shape, prompting ongoing scientific investigation.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it challenges existing theories about cometary behavior and could expand understanding of interstellar objects. Researchers around the world are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS, hoping that forthcoming data will clarify its nature and the implications of Loeb's claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It travels at approximately 61 kilometres per second (nearly 136,500 mph) relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Loeb’s theory suggests an 'anti-tail' may consist of a swarm of unknown objects.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus may measure between 0.3 and 5.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>Nasa continues to view 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet from another star system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>1 July 2025: 3I/ATLAS is discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</p>
<p>November 2025: Loeb observes the comet's unique coma and proposes the existence of an 'anti-tail'.</p>
<p>Present: Researchers worldwide continue to analyze data regarding 3I/ATLAS and its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Are they rocky fragments or something else?” - Avi Loeb, on the nature of the objects surrounding 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a perfectly natural comet that simply originated from another star system.” - NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object known to pass through our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Its unique characteristics and behavior have sparked debate among scientists regarding the nature of interstellar objects and the processes that govern their formation and evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey away from the Sun, scientists are awaiting further data to either support Loeb's theory of a swarm of unknown objects or confirm NASA's view of it as a natural comet. The window for definitive analysis is closing as the comet moves further into space.</p>
