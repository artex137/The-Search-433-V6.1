      <h2>'Technology is picking up ghosts underwater': 9,000 mysterious objects spotted off US shores; experts baffled</h2>

<p>A UFO-tracking platform has reported over 9,000 unidentified underwater objects off the coast of the United States since August 2025. Users of Enigma, a non-partisan organisation that claims to hold the largest historical database for global UFO sightings, have logged these sightings within 10 miles of US shorelines. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to these sightings.</p>

<p>This development raises questions about maritime security and the potential implications of unidentified submersible objects (USOs). Authorities and experts are now examining the data, which suggests a significant increase in sightings, particularly in coastal areas, prompting both public interest and concern among defense analysts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>More than 9,000 unidentified underwater sightings logged since August 2025.</li>
    <li>Approximately 500 sightings reported within five miles of US coastlines.</li>
    <li>California and Florida lead with 389 and 306 sightings, respectively.</li>
    <li>Enigma has catalogued nearly 30,000 UFO sightings worldwide since its launch in 2022.</li>
    <li>Major bodies of water have seen over 150 objects observed hovering or plunging in and out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its launch in 2022, Enigma has compiled a comprehensive database of UFO sightings globally. In August 2025, a spike in reports of unidentified underwater objects began, leading to the current tally of over 9,000 sightings off US shores.</p>
<p>Recent reports indicate concentrated clusters of sightings near specific coastal zones, particularly in California and Florida, raising eyebrows among experts and officials alike.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That’s one of two things. Either that’s something we don’t understand, or our technology is picking up ghosts underwater,” said author Kent Heckenlively.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Pilots, credible observers and calibrated military instruments have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air-sea interface in ways not possible for anything made by humans,” stated retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of unidentified objects in US waters has been a topic of discussion for years. A 2024 report by Gallaudet highlighted concerns regarding unidentified objects and their implications for maritime security. Previous incidents, such as the 2019 Pentagon video showing an unidentified object diving into the Pacific, have also raised alarms among military and governmental authorities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into these sightings are ongoing, with experts and authorities expected to analyze the data further. The focus will be on understanding the nature of these USOs and their potential impact on maritime safety and security.</p>
