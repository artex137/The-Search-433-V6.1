      <h2>NASA telescope spots unexpected activity on 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A NASA space telescope has detected unexpected behavior from Comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. The findings were reported following new observations made in December 2025. There have been no injuries or fatalities associated with the comet, which poses no danger to Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it provides a unique opportunity for scientists to study interstellar materials. As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches the end of its journey through the Solar System, researchers are racing to gather as much data as possible. The comet, discovered in the summer of 2025, is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed in this vicinity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in summer 2025</li>
    <li>NASA's SPHEREx space telescope made observations in December 2025</li>
    <li>The comet is moving away from the Sun</li>
    <li>Unexpected brightness surge observed two months after close approach to the Sun</li>
    <li>SPHEREx identified organic compounds including methanol, cyanide, and methane</li>
    <li>Large grains and clumps of material were also observed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in the summer of 2025. In December 2025, the SPHEREx space telescope conducted infrared observations that confirmed the presence of organic compounds. Shortly after its close approach to the Sun, the comet exhibited a significant increase in brightness, attributed to the rapid release of gases.</p>

<p>Researchers noted that the comet ejected material into space, with water converting to gas in interplanetary space. The SPHEREx analysis indicated the release of both fine dust and larger rocky material, which is significant for understanding the object's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS spectacularly ejected material into space after passing close to the Sun, and the water immediately converted to gas in interplanetary space,” said Carey Lisse of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects like Comet 3I/ATLAS are rare and provide valuable insights into the formation of materials beyond our Solar System. The findings from SPHEREx highlight the importance of short observation windows, as they can yield significant scientific data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun, focusing on collecting data on its composition and behavior. Further analysis of the comet’s unique surface properties may also be conducted.</p>
