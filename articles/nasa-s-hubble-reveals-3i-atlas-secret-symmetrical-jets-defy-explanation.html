      <h2>NASA's Hubble Reveals 3I/ATLAS Secret: Symmetrical Jets Defy Explanation</h2>

<p>A rare comet known as 3I/ATLAS has been travelling through our solar system and is now revealing unexpected characteristics, according to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The comet, which is only the third extra-solar object detected by humanity, is now making its way back into the depths of space after a close approach to the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about the behaviour of comets. Researchers are now re-evaluating initial observations, which were previously dismissed as unclear, to understand the comet's unusual properties and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third extra-solar object detected, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet has an estimated nucleus diameter between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS approached the sun at a speed of 246,000 kilometres per hour (153,000 miles per hour).</li>
    <li>Perihelion, or closest approach to the sun, occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object exhibits three symmetrical jets, a feature that defies traditional comet models.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is rich in carbon dioxide and contains very little water ice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed over the past few months, with initial images captured two to three months ago. These images were initially regarded as uninformative but have since been re-evaluated following further analysis.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2025, the comet reached its closest point to the sun, marking a significant moment in its journey.</p>
<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has provided high-resolution images that have clarified the nature of the comet, showing unexpected features such as its unusual jets and chemical profile.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The object's behaviour does not align with what we expect from a typical comet,” said Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, highlighting the mystery surrounding 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a small group of extra-solar objects that have been detected, with the previous two, 'Oumuamua and Borisov, also prompting scientific inquiry into the nature of interstellar objects. The unusual properties of 3I/ATLAS may lead to a reevaluation of our understanding of cometary behaviour.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the sun, focusing on its unique characteristics and behaviour. Future observations may provide further insights into this enigmatic object.</p>
