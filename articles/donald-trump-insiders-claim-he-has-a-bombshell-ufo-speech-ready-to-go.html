      <h2>Donald Trump insiders claim he has a bombshell UFO speech ready to go</h2>

<p>Reports have emerged that former President Donald Trump may deliver a speech revealing decades of alleged UFO evidence. The information comes from Mark Christopher Lee, a UK-based ufologist, who stated that an advisor to the Trump administration has informed him of the planned announcement.</p>

<p>This potential disclosure is significant as it could mark the first formal acknowledgment of extraterrestrial technology by a world leader. Authorities are reportedly preparing for the announcement, which could coincide with the 79th anniversary of the Roswell incident on July 8, 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Insider claims Trump has been authorized by world leaders to disclose UFO evidence.</li>
    <li>Speech may address high-profile incidents, including the 2004 USS Nimitz encounter.</li>
    <li>Originally scheduled for the United Nations General Assembly in September 2026.</li>
    <li>New intelligence developments have prompted a potential earlier announcement.</li>
    <li>Lee claims Trump aims to provide transparency on UFOs for the American public.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to Lee, the speech was initially planned for September 2026 during the United Nations General Assembly but has since been rescheduled. The new date aligns with the anniversary of the Roswell incident on July 8, 2026. Lee noted that the urgency of the announcement has increased due to new intelligence developments.</p>
<p>Lee further mentioned that Trump may act spontaneously and could deliver the speech before the scheduled date, especially if he perceives a risk from Russia or China announcing similar information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “He will confirm that forensic analysis of recovered off-world vehicles and non-human biologics has established their extraterrestrial origin,” Lee said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “He will emphasize that he is the first president to authorize full disclosure because the American people deserve transparency,” Lee added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The planned speech is expected to address several high-profile UFO incidents already acknowledged by the U.S. military. These include the November 2004 USS Nimitz encounter, where a former Navy pilot reported seeing an unidentified craft, and the 2015 USS Theodore Roosevelt incidents, known as GoFast and Gimbal, which were captured by infrared targeting systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As preparations continue for the potential announcement, no specific timeline for the speech has been confirmed. The administration is expected to monitor developments closely and may adjust the announcement date based on intelligence assessments.</p>
