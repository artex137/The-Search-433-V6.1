      <h2>CIA Fuels Doubts Over 3I/ATLAS After NASA Comet Claim</h2>

<p>Nearly two weeks after the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, a renewed debate has emerged regarding its true nature. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has responded to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, raising questions about previous assessments by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights ongoing concerns in the scientific community about the classification of 3I/ATLAS. While NASA has asserted that the object is a natural comet with no ties to alien technology, some scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, continue to challenge this conclusion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS made its closest flyby of Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
  <li>The CIA responded to a FOIA request stating it could “neither confirm nor deny” the existence of relevant documents.</li>
  <li>Nasa classified 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet.</li>
  <li>Avi Loeb has raised concerns about anomalies in the object's behaviour.</li>
  <li>Scientists expect 3I/ATLAS to leave the solar system entirely by 2030.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth. Following this event, NASA released findings classifying the object as a natural comet, asserting no links to unidentified flying objects. On December 31, 2025, the CIA responded to a FOIA request regarding 3I/ATLAS, stating it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of relevant documents, which has sparked further scrutiny.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has since pointed out various anomalies in the object's behaviour, including an unusual anti-tail and unexpected course changes, which he argues do not align with typical comet behaviour. This ongoing debate continues to attract attention within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa has classified 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet and ruled out any links to unidentified flying objects.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The CIA's response to the FOIA request has fueled speculation about classified knowledge.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CIA's guarded language in its response is standard for intelligence agencies but often leads to public speculation. The scientific community remains divided, with some experts advocating for a more thorough investigation into the object's characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the debate continues, scientists will monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels toward Jupiter, with expectations it will exit the solar system by 2030. Further inquiries may be pursued regarding the CIA's response and the object’s behaviour.</p>
