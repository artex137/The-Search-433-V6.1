      <h2>SPHEREx images show a marked difference in 3I/ATLAS' activity before and after perihelion</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited significant changes in activity as it departs the inner solar system, according to observations made by the SPHEREx observatory. The analysis of images captured by the telescope has revealed these differences following the comet's closest approach to the Sun in late October 2025.</p>

<p>This research matters as it enhances understanding of the comet's behavior and composition, which may provide insights into the formation of comets in both interstellar and solar systems. The findings have been detailed in a paper on arXiv, indicating that 3I/ATLAS remains an object of scientific interest as it continues its journey through space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): Late October 2025</li>
    <li>First SPHEREx analysis: August 2025</li>
    <li>Location during analysis: Between Jupiter and Mars</li>
    <li>Increase in carbon monoxide emissions: 20 times</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide emissions increased by 33% post-perihelion</li>
    <li>Next SPHEREx survey: April 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 and began approaching the Sun, reaching perihelion by late October 2025. SPHEREx first analyzed data from the comet in August 2025, revealing traces of water and carbon dioxide as it moved through the inner solar system. Following perihelion, the comet displayed increased activity, with emissions of gases such as carbon monoxide and water vapor rising significantly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The CO emitted flux has increased ~20x, meaning that the CO/CO₂ abundance ratio has also increased ~15-fold. Along with the greatly enhanced H₂O flux and new C-H species emission, this implies that a new ice reservoir is now active along with the one supporting the CO₂ coma," the study authors explained.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This change from pre-perihelion observations makes sense because, in August 2025, 3I's behavior was dominated by large icy dust grain emission, with the icy grains too cold to sublimate anything more volatile than CO₂ fully," the researchers wrote.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The composition of 3I/ATLAS is noted to resemble that of typical solar system comets. This connection suggests that similar processes may govern the formation of both interstellar and solar system comets. Previous studies have indicated that changes in temperature significantly affect the behavior of comets as they travel through varying regions of the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further detailed observations of 3I/ATLAS are expected to emerge before the next SPHEREx survey starts in April 2026, continuing the exploration of this interstellar comet's characteristics and activity.</p>
