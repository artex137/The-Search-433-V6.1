      <h2>3I/ATLAS getting 'slower' but there's 'strong evidence' it became brighter</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed slowing down while displaying unexpected brightness as it approaches perihelion, according to theoretical physicist Avi Loeb of Harvard University. The comet entered the Solar System on July 1 and has been under close scrutiny by scientists worldwide.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it may provide insights into the comet's behavior and composition. NASA has dismissed claims that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft, affirming it is a comet from another star system. Loeb's findings suggest that the comet's acceleration and brightness could have implications for understanding its trajectory and potential interactions within the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System on July 1, 2023.</li>
  <li>Loeb reported that the radial acceleration component A1 decreased from 1.6x10<sup>-6</sup> au per day squared on October 30 to 4x10<sup>-7</sup> au per day squared by November 24.</li>
  <li>The comet is expected to be 53.445 million kilometers from Jupiter on March 16, 2024.</li>
  <li>Professor Loeb speculates that 3I/ATLAS may deploy satellites to observe Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System on July 1, 2023. On October 30, 2025, Loeb noted a decrease in the radial acceleration component A1. By November 24, this value had been reduced by a factor of four. Looking ahead, the comet is projected to be closest to Jupiter on March 16, 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is strong evidence that 3I/ATLAS became brighter near perihelion than the smooth 1/r² model would predict,” said Professor Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest among scientists and the public since its discovery. While some theories have suggested it could be an alien spacecraft, NASA has confirmed it is a comet, emphasizing the need for scientific rigor in understanding such celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its approach to Jupiter, scientists will monitor its trajectory and brightness closely. Further observations are expected to clarify its behavior and any potential interactions with the gas giant.</p>
