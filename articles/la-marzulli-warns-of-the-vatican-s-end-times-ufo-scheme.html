      <h2>LA Marzulli Warns of the Vatican’s End Times UFO Scheme</h2>

<p>In a recent interview with Charisma Media, prophetic researcher and author L.A. Marzulli has raised concerns about the Vatican's involvement in the UFO phenomenon, warning of what he describes as a coming great deception. Marzulli spoke on the implications of recent Vatican statements regarding extraterrestrial life, suggesting a coordinated effort among church leaders to prepare the public for these developments.</p>

<p>This warning comes at a time when church officials, including Pope Leo, have made headlines with remarks about the potential baptism of extraterrestrials. Marzulli claims that the nature of UFOs is misunderstood, asserting they represent interdimensional entities with a deceptive agenda. He emphasizes the seriousness of this issue, suggesting that even the most devout could be misled.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>L.A. Marzulli is a prophetic researcher and author.</li>
    <li>The interview was conducted by Charisma Media.</li>
    <li>Marzulli claims the Vatican is repackaging its messages under a new pope.</li>
    <li>He traces UFO sightings and related phenomena back to the 1940s and 1950s.</li>
    <li>The Pope has stated a willingness to baptize extraterrestrial beings.</li>
    <li>Marzulli describes these entities as fallen angels rather than extraterrestrials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Marzulli highlights a historical context for the UFO phenomenon, connecting its emergence to significant global events. He notes that after Israel declared statehood in 1948, reports of abductions and UFO sightings began to escalate. This timeline suggests a correlation between geopolitical events and the rise in paranormal activity.</p>

<p>In the interview, Marzulli critiques current media narratives surrounding space objects, including the recent focus on 3I/ATLAS. He argues that such coverage serves as a form of preparatory programming for the public, implying that there is more to these phenomena than what is being reported.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re just repackaging it with a new pope,” Marzulli said, referring to recent Vatican statements about extraterrestrials.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These are interdimensional entities, which have a very nefarious agenda and are here to usher in the time of the great deception,” Marzulli added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The Church doesn’t understand what they’re looking at,” Marzulli stated regarding Vatican astronomers.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Marzulli's claims reflect a broader skepticism towards the Vatican's approach to extraterrestrial life. He argues that the church's statements do not adequately address the complexities of these phenomena. The increase in UFO sightings and related incidents since the mid-20th century has prompted various interpretations and theories, often leading to debate among researchers and religious leaders alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions about the Vatican's stance on extraterrestrial life continue, Marzulli's warnings may prompt further investigation into the church's position and its implications for believers. The ongoing dialogue around UFOs and their significance is likely to evolve, as both media and religious institutions respond to these emerging narratives.</p>
