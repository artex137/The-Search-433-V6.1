      <h2>Truth About 3I/ATLAS: Brian Cox Breaks Silence on Claims It Could Be an Alien Probe</h2>

<p>Professor Brian Cox has addressed speculation regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, stating it is not an alien probe but a comet that has traveled through space for an estimated 10 billion years. The comet was first identified on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) team.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unique characteristics, which provide insights into the early universe. The scientific community, including experts from NASA and the SETI Institute, has emphasized that there is no credible evidence to suggest the object is artificial. Observations of the comet are ongoing as it moves deeper into our Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First spotted:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Identified by:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated age:</strong> 10 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Scientific designation:</strong> Third interstellar object recorded</li>
    <li><strong>Current observation efforts:</strong> ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), NASA's Perseverance rover</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the ATLAS team first identified 3I/ATLAS as an extraordinary object, confirming it as a comet rather than an asteroid. The comet is believed to have formed approximately 7.5 billion years ago. As it approached the Sun, it began actively outgassing, further solidifying its classification as a comet.</p>

<p>Following its discovery, various space agencies mobilized to observe the comet. The European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter successfully captured images of 3I/ATLAS as it passed by Mars. Additional observation efforts are planned as the comet nears Jupiter's orbit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The truth about 3I/ATLAS isn't about aliens; it's about us,”</blockquote>
<p>said Professor Cox during an interview with the BBC. He described the comet as a "time capsule," offering invaluable clues about the universe's early conditions.</p>

<blockquote>“Merely 400 years ago, we were debating whether the Earth went around the Sun,”</blockquote>
<p>Cox noted, highlighting humanity's advancements in space observation technology.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows a growing interest in interstellar objects, with only two other such objects recorded prior. The scientific community continues to explore the origins and characteristics of these rare cosmic visitors to better understand the history of our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue as it travels through the Solar System. Future imaging by the ESA's JUICE mission and confirmation of images from NASA's Perseverance rover are anticipated in the coming weeks.</p>
