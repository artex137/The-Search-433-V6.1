      <h2>The Juice probe transmits a new image from the 3I/ATLAS satellite</h2>

<p>The Juice probe has captured an image of comet 3I/ATLAS on November 2, 2023, during its mission, two days before the comet's closest approach of approximately 66 million kilometres on November 4. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This image is significant as it reveals signs of significant activity on the comet. Researchers expect to receive complete scientific data from the probe in February 2026, which will provide further insights into the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Image captured on November 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach of comet 3I/ATLAS recorded on November 4, 2023, at approximately 66 million km.</li>
    <li>First observation period of the Juice mission.</li>
    <li>Complete data expected between February 18 and 20, 2026.</li>
    <li>Five instruments activated: JANUS, MAJIS, UVS, SWI, and PEP.</li>
    <li>Transmission delay due to the use of the high-gain antenna as a heat shield.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 2, 2023, the Juice probe captured a partial image of comet 3I/ATLAS. This occurred during the mission's first observation period, just two days before the comet's closest approach. On November 4, 2023, the probe recorded the closest approach at approximately 66 million km from the comet.</p>

<p>Researchers have noted that the image indicates a bright halo of gas, called a coma, and two tails, one of which appears to be a plasma tail and the other a dust tail. The full scientific data from the five activated instruments is scheduled for delivery in February 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The image showed the bright halo of gas known as a coma and an indication of two tails,” researchers reported.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We expect clearer signs of this activity in the data packages, particularly the complete JANUS images,” the team stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Juice mission aims to study the characteristics and behaviors of various celestial bodies, including comets, during their active phases. Observations of 3I/ATLAS are particularly relevant as they occur shortly after the comet's closest approach to the Sun, a period known for heightened activity and material release.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will analyze the complete data expected in early 2026 to enhance their understanding of comet 3I/ATLAS's physical behavior and trajectory through the Solar System.</p>
