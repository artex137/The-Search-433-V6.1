      <h2>Frequent influx of purported UFO footage</h2>

<p>Professor Chandana Jayaratne, Head of the Department of Physics at the University of Colombo, has reported a steady stream of videos claiming to show UFOs sent to him and other scientific institutions in Sri Lanka. His comments come in response to a video circulating on social media that allegedly depicts a UFO following a shrimp farmer near the Voice of America (VOA) transmission centre in Iranawila. The sighting occurred around 3:00 a.m. on January 27, 2026.</p>

<p>This situation has raised questions about the nature of these sightings and the response from authorities. Jayaratne and other scientists are investigating the credibility of these claims and the implications for understanding aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sighting reported on January 27, 2026, at approximately 3:00 a.m.</li>
    <li>Location: Near the Voice of America transmission centre in Iranawila, Sri Lanka.</li>
    <li>Involved parties: A shrimp farmer and a colleague.</li>
    <li>The farmer signalled the object with a torch, prompting a response.</li>
    <li>Two illuminated objects were observed in the sky before dawn.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The incident began around 3:00 a.m. on January 27, 2026, when a shrimp farmer noticed a blinking object in the sky near the VOA transmission centre. After signalling the object with a torch, both he and a colleague observed the object moving towards them, causing them to flee the area. The colleague managed to record a video, which has since gained attention on social media. Later, the pair reported seeing two illuminated objects in the sky before dawn.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We receive numerous videos claiming to show UFOs, and each needs to be assessed for authenticity,” said Professor Jayaratne.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have become a topic of interest in Sri Lanka, with various claims surfacing over the years. The increase in reported sightings has prompted scientific institutions to take a more active role in investigating these phenomena, as public interest continues to grow.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the authenticity of the reported UFO sighting are ongoing. Authorities and scientific institutions are expected to collaborate on assessing the footage and determining the nature of the observed phenomena.</p>
