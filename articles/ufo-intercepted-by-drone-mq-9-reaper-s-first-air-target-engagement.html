      <h2>UFO Intercepted by Drone: MQ-9 Reaper's First Air Target Engagement</h2>

<p>Republican Eric Burlison has released a video showing an MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) striking an unidentified flying object (UFO) near the coast of Yemen in October 2024. No injuries or fatalities have been reported from this incident.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the first documented instance of an MQ-9 Reaper intercepting an airborne target with an air-to-ground missile. Authorities are examining the video, which adds to the ongoing series of U.S. drone encounters with UFOs. The authenticity of the footage is currently under scrutiny as independent verification is ongoing.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in October 2024, video released recently.</li>
    <li>Location: Near the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>Weapon used: AGM-114 Hellfire guided missile.</li>
    <li>Two MQ-9 Reapers were involved in the operation.</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper UAV engaged a UFO near the coast of Yemen. The UAV used an AGM-114 Hellfire missile to strike the object. The missile did not detonate, and the UFO continued on its path. The video of the incident was released recently by Eric Burlison.</p>

<p>Earlier, in 2017, the MQ-9 Reaper had previously intercepted a target drone using an AIM-9X air-to-air missile, indicating its capacity to engage aerial threats.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Independent verification is ongoing,” Eric Burlison stated regarding the video’s authenticity.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The U.S. established the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) in 2020 to investigate UFO sightings. This development followed the Pentagon's confirmation of the authenticity of previous UFO footage. The ongoing interest in UFOs has led to various reports and investigations into aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to investigate the incident and assess the implications of the video. No specific deadlines for the investigation have been disclosed.</p>
