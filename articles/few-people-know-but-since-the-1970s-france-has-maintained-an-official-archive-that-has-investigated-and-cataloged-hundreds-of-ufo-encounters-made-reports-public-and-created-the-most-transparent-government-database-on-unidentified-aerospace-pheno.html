      <h2>France Maintains Official UFO Archive Since 1970s</h2>

<p>Since the 1970s, France has operated an official archive investigating and cataloging hundreds of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as UFOs. The Groupe d'Études et d'Informations sur les Phénomènes Aérospatiaux Non-identifiés (GEIPAN) functions under the National Center for Space Studies (CNES) in Toulouse, France, and has made significant strides in transparency by publishing reports since 2007.</p>

<p>This initiative is notable as it represents one of the most transparent government databases on UFO sightings globally. Authorities aim to provide the public with access to information that has historically been limited to military personnel and isolated researchers. GEIPAN's work includes collecting, analyzing, and classifying reports of UAPs to better understand these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>GEIPAN was established in 1977, originally as GEPAN.</li>
    <li>It became SEPRA in 1988 and was officially renamed GEIPAN in 2005.</li>
    <li>As of its initial publication, approximately 400 out of over 1,600 documented reports have been made available online.</li>
    <li>Reports include testimonies, diagrams, and classifications of sightings.</li>
    <li>GEIPAN collaborates with French police, civil aviation authorities, and meteorologists.</li>
    <li>The archive is accessible online, allowing public searches by location, date, and type of phenomenon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1977, France established GEPAN to investigate UFO sightings. The organization was reorganized into SEPRA in 1988 and renamed GEIPAN in 2005, with a mission to document and analyze UAPs. In March 2007, GEIPAN began publishing official sighting files online, providing public access to decades of reports.</p>
<p>In 2017, revelations about a secret Pentagon program investigating UFOs for five years prompted increased interest in UAP research globally. This program received $22 million and analyzed U.S. Navy encounters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The mission of GEIPAN is not about searching for extraterrestrial life, but rather to document and analyze phenomena that cannot be explained by the scientific tools and methods currently available,” according to CNES.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Experts have noted that GEIPAN’s transparency has transformed the study of UFOs into a more accessible documentary field, breaking the taboo surrounding the topic.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to GEIPAN's establishment, UFO research often relied on anecdotal evidence and lacked formal investigation. The opening of GEIPAN's archives has allowed independent researchers and the public to engage with structured reports, fostering comparative analyses and academic studies on UFO sightings.</p>
<p>This approach has influenced other countries to consider how they document and share information regarding UAPs, promoting a shift from secrecy to transparency in governmental research on unidentified phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>GEIPAN continues to update its database with new reports and is committed to maintaining a rigorous scientific approach to analysis. The agency aims to further engage with the public and researchers to enhance understanding of unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>
