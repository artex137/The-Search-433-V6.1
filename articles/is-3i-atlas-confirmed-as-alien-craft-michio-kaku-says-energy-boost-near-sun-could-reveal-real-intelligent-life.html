      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS Confirmed As Alien Craft? Michio Kaku Says Energy Boost Near Sun Could Reveal Real Intelligent Life</h2>

<p>A mysterious object, 3I/ATLAS, is currently passing through our solar system, sparking debate among astronomers about its nature. The interstellar object is on a hyperbolic path towards the Sun, expected to reach its closest point, or perihelion, on October 29, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to provide new insights into the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth. Authorities are closely monitoring its trajectory, as it has been added to the international asteroid warning network, the first interstellar object to be included on this list.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Expected perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Under observation by global observatories</li>
    <li><strong>Notable figure:</strong> Dr. Michio Kaku, physicist at City College of New York</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring agency:</strong> International asteroid warning network</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has traveled through the solar system and is set to make its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2023. Dr. Kaku has indicated that the object's behavior during this fly-by will be critical in determining its nature.</p>
<p>Post perihelion, tracking will begin around October 30 to assess any changes in the object's energy levels, which could indicate propulsion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“In mere days, 3I/ATLAS promises to yield new information, and perhaps, new questions,” said Dr. Michio Kaku during a Newsmax appearance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If the object picks up extra energy during this manoeuvre, it would be a decisive moment,” Kaku added, emphasizing the importance of the upcoming perihelion.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the identification of two previous interstellar objects. Most astronomers believe 3I/ATLAS is just a rock from deep space, while a smaller faction suggests it could be an intelligent visitor.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Global observatories will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely after its perihelion on October 29. The results of this observation could significantly impact our understanding of the universe and the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
