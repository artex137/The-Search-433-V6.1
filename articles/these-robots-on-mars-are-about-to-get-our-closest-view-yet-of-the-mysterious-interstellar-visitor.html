      <h2>NASA and ESA to Observe Comet 3I/ATLAS from Mars</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have announced that their Mars spacecraft will observe comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes through our Solar System. The comet, discovered on 1 July 2025, is currently en route to the Sun and will be closest to Mars on 3 October 2025.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar objects to enter our Solar System. The spacecraft will provide crucial data about the comet's composition and activity before it becomes invisible from Earth until early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Mars will occur on 3 October 2025, at a distance of 30 million km (18.6 million miles).</li>
    <li>ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will conduct observations between 1 and 7 October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Perseverance and Curiosity rovers will also attempt to observe the comet in early October 2025.</li>
    <li>Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) will observe 3I/ATLAS in November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been tracked since its discovery on 1 July 2025. It will make its closest approach to Mars on 3 October 2025. During this period, ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will utilize their instruments to gather data about the comet. Following the observations from Mars, the Juice mission will have an opportunity to view the comet in November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These missions are well equipped to carry out some of the vital science that astronomers want to achieve before 3I/ATLAS exits our Solar System,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Unfortunately, the cameras on these spacecraft were designed to photograph the surface of Mars and won't be able to pick out much detail on such a relatively small comet 30 million km away,” an ESA representative noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of only three confirmed interstellar objects to enter the Solar System. The previous observations of such comets have provided valuable insights into their origins and compositions. The current observation efforts reflect ongoing advancements in space exploration and interstellar research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the observations in October 2025, ESA's Juice mission will attempt to gather further data on 3I/ATLAS in November 2025. NASA's Mars rovers will also continue to monitor the comet's activity as it approaches the Sun.</p>
