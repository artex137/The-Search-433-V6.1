      <h2>How to See Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS as It Swings by Earth One Last Time</h2>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 18, 2025, passing within 167 million miles of the planet. This marks the final chance for backyard astronomers to observe the comet before it continues its journey back into interstellar space. The comet will appear as a bright star in the night sky, making it accessible for sky watchers equipped with binoculars or telescopes.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. Scientists have been closely monitoring the comet since its discovery in July 2025. Observations during its approach may provide insights into the formation of solar systems beyond our own. The United Nations’ International Asteroid Warning Network is also tracking the comet to enhance planetary defense against near-Earth objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth on December 18, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass within 167 million miles of Earth.</li>
    <li>It was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at approximately 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project will live stream the approach starting at 11 P.M. EST on December 18.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS occurred in July 2025. Since then, astronomers have observed its trajectory as it neared the Sun. On December 18, 2025, the comet will make its closest approach to Earth, providing a unique opportunity for observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It’s like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second,” said astronomer David Jewitt, who has observed the comet using the Hubble Space Telescope.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable because it is only the third interstellar object recorded to have entered our solar system. Its hyperbolic path indicates that it is moving too fast to be gravitationally bound to the Sun, similar to other interstellar visitors. Observing the comet's dust and gas emissions may provide valuable data about its formation and origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will continue to monitor its path and analyze the data collected during its flyby. The observations may contribute to a better understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>
