      <h2>Scientists Capture First Signal from 'Alien Ship' in the Solar System</h2>

<p>Scientists have received the first signal from the cosmic object 3I/ATLAS, which is moving towards Earth in the Solar System. The signal was detected using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa, according to The Astronomer’s Telegram (AT). No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS may not be a typical comet. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has indicated that its anomalous behavior could imply that it is an alien ship using an engine to change direction. Authorities are preparing for further observations, with plans for the Juno spacecraft to attempt to capture its radio signal on March 16, 2026, when 3I/ATLAS is near Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Signal detected: Absorption of OH in 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz lines</li>
    <li>Location of detection: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1</li>
    <li>Deviation from predicted trajectory: Four arc seconds along the right ascension axis</li>
    <li>Next signal capture attempt: March 16, 2026, by Juno near Jupiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1 using NASA's network of telescopes. It entered the Solar System a few months ago and reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29. The signal detection occurred recently, marking the first successful capture of data from this object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS exhibits too anomalous behavior for a comet. This may indicate that the object is an alien ship changing its direction of movement using an engine."</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA employee David Farnocchia noted that the object has changed its trajectory compared to what was predicted, suggesting that its path is influenced by factors other than gravity.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Experts generally consider 3I/ATLAS to be an interstellar comet. However, Avi Loeb's claims raise questions about its origin and nature. The rapid degassing of comets as they approach the Sun typically causes them to "melt" and form a tail, which may also be occurring with 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, with the Juno spacecraft scheduled to attempt to capture its radio signal in March 2026.</p>
