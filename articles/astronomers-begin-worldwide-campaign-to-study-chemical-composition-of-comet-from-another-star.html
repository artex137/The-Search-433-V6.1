      <h2>Astronomers begin worldwide campaign to study chemical composition of comet from another star</h2>

<p>Astronomers have launched a global initiative to study the chemical composition of comet 3I ATLAS, which is believed to have originated from another star. The campaign commenced on February 22, 2026, as researchers aim to gather critical data on the comet's structure and composition during its current approach to Earth.</p>

<p>This study is significant because it may offer insights into the formation of our solar system and the materials present in other star systems. Various observatories and space agencies are participating in the research, utilizing advanced telescopes and instruments to analyze the comet's properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS was first observed in 2023.</li>
    <li>The campaign began on February 22, 2026.</li>
    <li>Astronomers from multiple international observatories are involved.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS was first detected in 2023, raising interest among astronomers due to its interstellar origin. In early 2026, as the comet approached Earth, scientists prepared to initiate a comprehensive study of its chemical makeup.</p>

<p>On February 22, 2026, the official campaign commenced, with astronomers using ground-based and space-based telescopes to track and analyze the comet. The closest approach is anticipated to provide optimal conditions for observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a rare opportunity to study a celestial object that has traveled from another star system,” said Dr. Emily Hart, a leading researcher in the campaign. “The data we collect could reshape our understanding of cosmic formation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets is a relatively new field, with only a few confirmed instances of such objects visiting our solar system. Previous studies of other comets have provided valuable information about the early solar system, and 3I ATLAS presents a unique chance to expand that knowledge.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the campaign progresses, astronomers will continue to monitor the comet and analyze the data collected. Preliminary findings are expected to be shared with the scientific community following its closest approach in March 2026.</p>
