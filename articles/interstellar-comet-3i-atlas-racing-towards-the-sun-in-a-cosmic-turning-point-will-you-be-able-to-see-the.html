      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its closest point to the Sun on Wednesday, October 18, 2023, coming within approximately 126 million miles of the solar body. Discovered in July 2025, 3I/ATLAS is currently passing through our solar system and has garnered the attention of astronomers and sky-watchers alike. The comet poses no threat to Earth, according to reports.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>This event is significant as it marks the halfway point of 3I/ATLAS's journey through the solar system. Scientists believe the comet may begin to break up due to the intense heat from the Sun. Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has referred to this moment as "the acid test of 3I/ATLAS," indicating its importance in understanding the comet's behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on October 18, 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: approximately 126 million miles.</li>
    <li>Expected visibility from Earth: late November or early December 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth expected on December 19, 2023, at about 165 million miles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has passed behind the Sun, entering a phase known as solar conjunction, which has rendered it temporarily invisible from Earth since late September 2023. This means that Earth-based and orbiting telescopes have missed the chance to observe the comet during its closest approach.</p>
<p>After perihelion on October 18, astronomers will begin monitoring the comet's behavior as it moves away from the Sun. It is anticipated that any changes in trajectory or speed could provide insights into its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is the acid test of 3I/ATLAS,” said Harvard physicist Avi Loeb. “We will need months of observations to see how it reacts to reaching its perihelion with the Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is considered a strange comet due to its unusual chemical makeup, which indicates a potential origin from a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy. Its tail of gas and dust resembles that of typical icy comets, prompting researchers to investigate how such interstellar objects form and travel through space.</p>
<p>Previous studies have highlighted the comet's release of carbon dioxide gas, suggesting it may have formed under different conditions compared to most comets in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its perihelion, scientists will closely observe 3I/ATLAS for any odd behavior, including changes in course and speed. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023, at which point further studies may reveal more about its nature and origins.</p>
