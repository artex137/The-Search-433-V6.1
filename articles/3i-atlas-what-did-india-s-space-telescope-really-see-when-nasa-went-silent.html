      <h2>3I/ATLAS: What Did India’s Space Telescope Really See When NASA Went Silent</h2>

<p>In July 2025, India's space telescope and other astronomers observed a mysterious interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS while NASA maintained silence, presenting puzzling results that intrigued scientists worldwide.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to transit the solar system, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. The behavior of 3I/ATLAS has raised questions among researchers, prompting calls for transparency from NASA and leading to a coordinated global effort to study this unusual visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First detected:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 29-30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>International collaboration:</strong> Supported by India's telescope and other global observatories</li>
    <li><strong>Notable chemical findings:</strong> Nickel vapor and nickel tetracarbonyl detected</li>
    <li><strong>Unusual observation:</strong> Anti-solar tail direction change</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, which initiated a global observational effort. As scientists studied the object, they noted its strange behavior, particularly the unexpected change in its tail direction.</p>

<p>Despite the unusual findings, NASA remained largely silent, leading to increased scrutiny and calls for transparency from the scientific community. Meanwhile, India's space telescope continued to observe 3I/ATLAS, contributing valuable data to the global effort.</p>

<p>The object made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29-30, 2025, marking a rare event expected to occur once every 400 years.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS has the potential to change everything about our understanding of the Universe we live in,” said Avi Loeb from Harvard.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows two previous interstellar objects, 'Oumuamua and Borisov, which have also sparked significant scientific interest. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, such as the presence of nickel compounds and the absence of iron, add to the growing intrigue regarding interstellar objects and their origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The object will soon be lost in deep space for the foreseeable future, but telescopes worldwide, including those in India, will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS. Researchers will analyze the data and potential samples for years to come to uncover the secrets of the solar system's formation.</p>
