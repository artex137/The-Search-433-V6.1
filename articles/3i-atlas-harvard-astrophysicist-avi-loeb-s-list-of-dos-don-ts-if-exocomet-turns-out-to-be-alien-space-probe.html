      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb’s List Of Dos & Don'ts If Exocomet Turns Out To Be Alien Space Probe</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), which uses five 0.5-meter telescopes to monitor the sky. The comet has sparked interest due to its near-absence of a cometary tail, leading some to speculate it could be the first interstellar contact from beyond our solar system. So far, mainstream scientists have ruled out any technological characteristics, but Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has identified 13 anomalies associated with the object.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the nature of the interstellar object and the potential for extraterrestrial life. Researchers anticipate the closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units, or approximately 270 million kilometers. NASA has released images from its various assets, including the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, but these have not met public expectations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 1.8 AU (approximately 270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Closest approach date: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has identified 13 anomalies associated with the comet</li>
    <li>NASA has released images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS. The comet's unusual characteristics, particularly its lack of a cometary tail, have generated considerable excitement among researchers and the public alike. As of now, mainstream scientists have dismissed the idea that it possesses any technological features.</p>

<p>In the months following its discovery, Avi Loeb has published analyses identifying various anomalies. He has proposed that if the comet is indeed a spacecraft, it might send probes into the atmosphere of Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb noted in a blog, "Currently, humanity is not prepared for a potential threat from alien technology. The wake-up call from 3I/ATLAS might stir us in the right direction."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows a growing interest in interstellar objects, particularly after the detection of ‘Oumuamua in 2017. This has prompted discussions within the scientific community about the implications of extraterrestrial technology and the need for preparedness in the event of contact.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As researchers continue to observe 3I/ATLAS, they will prepare for its closest approach to Earth in December 2025. Further studies and potential exploratory missions may be planned based on its behavior and characteristics as it nears the gas giant Jupiter.</p>
