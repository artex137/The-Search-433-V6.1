      <h2>Scientists pointed a giant telescope at 3I/ATLAS to scan for alien life — this is what they found</h2>

<p>A team of scientists has scanned the comet 3I/ATLAS using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia on December 18, 2025, but has reported no signs of artificial radio signals. The scan occurred one day before the comet's closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This investigation has garnered significant attention as researchers seek to understand the origins of 3I/ATLAS and explore the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb stated that the lack of detected signals does not rule out the comet's potential artificial origins, emphasizing the need for further study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
  <li>The Green Bank Telescope is the largest single-dish radio telescope in the world, measuring 100 meters.</li>
  <li>The scan lasted five hours, alternating between the comet and the surrounding sky.</li>
  <li>No artificial radio emissions were detected, according to the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI).</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS shows typical cometary characteristics, including a coma and an unelongated nucleus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 18, 2025, the Green Bank Telescope aimed at 3I/ATLAS to search for potential extraterrestrial signals. This scan occurred just before the comet's closest approach to Earth.</p>
<p>During the five-hour observation, researchers alternated the telescope's focus between the comet and the surrounding sky to rule out any unrelated signals.</p>
<p>Following the scan, scientists reported their findings, stating that no candidate signals were detected from 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb remarked, "It is unclear whether a technological object would transmit radio signals to its senders because such signals would take tens of thousands of years to cross the Milky Way Galaxy."</blockquote>
<blockquote>SETI stated on its website, "No artificial radio emission localized to 3I/ATLAS was detected."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb criticized the team's method, saying, "If they were motivated to find something, they won’t just look on December 18th and report nothing."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The investigation into 3I/ATLAS follows a tradition of searching for extraterrestrial life and technology within our solar system. The comet, which is one of only three known interstellar comets, has become a focal point for researchers interested in the possibility of interstellar probes.</p>
<p>NASA has maintained that 3I/ATLAS is of cometary origin, aligning with the findings of the Breakthrough Listen team.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb continues to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS, claiming there are at least 15 unexplained anomalies related to the comet. Further research and monitoring efforts are expected as scientists aim to deepen their understanding of this interstellar visitor.</p>
