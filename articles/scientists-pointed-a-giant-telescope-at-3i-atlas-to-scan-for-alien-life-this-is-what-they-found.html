      <h2>Scientists Scan Comet 3I/ATLAS for Signs of Alien Life</h2>

<p>Researchers have completed a targeted scan of comet 3I/ATLAS using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia on December 18, one day before the comet's closest approach to Earth on December 19. The scan, conducted by the Breakthrough Listen team, has not detected any signs of artificial radio transmissions.</p>

<p>This effort is significant as it aims to explore the potential for extraterrestrial technology associated with 3I/ATLAS. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, who encouraged the investigation, stated that the absence of signals does not rule out the comet's potential artificial origins. The study remains yet to be peer-reviewed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Earth on December 19, 2022.</li>
    <li>The Green Bank Telescope is the largest single-dish radio telescope in the world, measuring 100 metres in diameter.</li>
    <li>The scanning lasted five hours, alternating between the comet and the surrounding sky.</li>
    <li>No artificial radio emissions localized to 3I/ATLAS were detected, according to the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI).</li>
    <li>The object exhibits typical cometary characteristics, including a coma and an unelongated nucleus.</li>
    <li>The study highlighted that there is no evidence to suggest 3I/ATLAS is anything other than a natural astrophysical object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 18, 2022, the Breakthrough Listen team directed the Green Bank Telescope at comet 3I/ATLAS for five hours. They alternated observations between the comet and the surrounding sky every five minutes to ensure accurate readings. Despite this careful approach, the team did not detect any candidate signals from the comet.</p>

<p>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth occurred on December 19, 2022. Following the observation, the SETI Institute confirmed the lack of artificial emissions from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No artificial radio emission localized to 3I/ATLAS was detected,” the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) stated on its website.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“They looked in the direction of 3I/ATLAS on December 18th. That’s one day out of the 8,000 years that 3I/ATLAS spent on its way in,” Avi Loeb commented.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If they were motivated to find something, they won’t just look on December 18th and report nothing,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, discovered in 2019, is one of only three known interstellar objects. Its unusual trajectory has prompted interest from scientists regarding its origins and potential technological aspects. Previous investigations into similar objects have yielded limited findings.</p>

<p>Nasa has maintained that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet. The recent scanning efforts align with ongoing research into extraterrestrial phenomena and the potential for interstellar communication.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has indicated that he will continue to analyze data related to 3I/ATLAS, claiming that there are at least 15 unexplained anomalies associated with the comet. Further studies and observations may be planned as researchers aim to gather more information on its characteristics and origins.</p>
