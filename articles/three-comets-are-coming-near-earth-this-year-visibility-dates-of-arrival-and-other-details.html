      <h2>Three comets are approaching Earth in October 2023</h2>
<p>Three comets are nearing Earth this October, with varying visibility and characteristics, according to astronomers. The comets include C/2025 K1 (ATLAS), C/2025 R2 (SWAN), and C/2025 A6 (Lemmon). Notably, the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which will not be visible from Earth, has generated considerable interest due to its unusual properties.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomy enthusiasts and researchers, as it presents opportunities for observation and study. Authorities and astronomers have been monitoring these comets closely, particularly the brightness and trajectory of C/2025 R2 (SWAN), which may be visible to the naked eye later this month.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) will reach its closest point to Earth on October 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 24 million miles.</li>
    <li>C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was discovered on January 3, 2023, and may be visible without a telescope later this month.</li>
    <li>C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) has an orbital period of 1,396 years and last passed Earth in the year 629.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas was first observed in May 2025 and will make its closest approach to Earth on November 24-25, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is currently about 50 million miles from Earth and is getting brighter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The following details outline key events related to the comets:</p>
<ul>
    <li>January 3, 2023: C/2025 R2 (SWAN) discovered by telescopes in Arizona.</li>
    <li>September 11, 2023: 3I/Atlas discovered by amateur astronomer Vladimir Bezugly.</li>
    <li>October 8, 2023: 3I/Atlas will reach perihelion, its closest point to the Sun.</li>
    <li>October 19, 2023: C/2025 R2 (SWAN) will be at its closest point to Earth.</li>
    <li>November 8, 2023: C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) will reach perihelion.</li>
    <li>November 24-25, 2025: 3I/Atlas will make its closest approach to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is a lot for astronomy and stargazing enthusiasts to look forward to in the next few weeks,” said an unnamed astronomer regarding the upcoming visibility of the comets.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This comet season marks a unique opportunity for both amateur and professional astronomers to observe celestial events. The visibility of C/2025 R2 (SWAN) without a telescope represents a rare chance, as most comets require optical instruments for observation. The discovery of 3I/Atlas has also raised questions about its nature, with some speculating it may not be a natural object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor the brightness and trajectory of these comets as they approach Earth. Observations will provide valuable data on their characteristics and behaviors, particularly for C/2025 R2 (SWAN) and 3I/Atlas as they near their respective perihelions.</p>
