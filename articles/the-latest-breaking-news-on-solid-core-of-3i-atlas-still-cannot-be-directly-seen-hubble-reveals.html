      <h2>The Latest Breaking News on Solid Core of 3I/ATLAS Still Cannot Be Directly Seen, Hubble Reveals</h2>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has confirmed that the solid core of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS remains unseen, despite recent speculation surrounding its nature. Observations have shown only blurry images of the comet, leading experts to question the authenticity of viral photos claiming to depict its core.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it raises questions regarding the true nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential origins. Authorities and researchers, including astronomers, are calling for more rigorous analysis and transparency regarding the comet's characteristics. The ongoing debate highlights the need for continued investigation into this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently being observed by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>Recent images have not provided a clear view of its solid core.</li>
    <li>Experts have expressed skepticism about the authenticity of leaked images circulating online.</li>
    <li>Hubble's observations indicate that the comet exhibits violent jets.</li>
    <li>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has suggested that these jets may indicate engineered technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2019 as it approached the solar system. Since then, it has drawn significant attention from the scientific community due to its unusual characteristics. Recent observations from Hubble have been ongoing, with the latest findings confirming the core remains unseen.</p>

<p>The viral images that sparked debate were released recently, but experts have largely dismissed them as likely fakes based on Hubble's data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The jets and survival of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS point to engineered ion-thrusters rather than a natural comet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of the few interstellar objects observed passing through our solar system. Previous studies of similar objects have provided insight into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies outside our solar system.</p>

<p>The ongoing discussions about 3I/ATLAS reflect broader trends in astrophysics, where the distinction between natural phenomena and potential artificial structures is increasingly scrutinized.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest flyby to Earth. This event is expected to yield further data that could clarify the comet's structure and origins.</p>
