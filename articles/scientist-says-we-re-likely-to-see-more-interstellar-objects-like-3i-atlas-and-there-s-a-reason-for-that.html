      <h2>Scientist says we're likely to see more interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS and there's a reason for that</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object that originated outside our galaxy, has been observed in our solar system since its discovery in July 2025. Experts have studied the comet as it passed through our cosmic neighborhood, providing valuable insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that more interstellar objects may be detected in the future. Authorities, including researchers from the University of Oxford, are preparing for advancements in observational technology, particularly with the upcoming Vera C Rubin Observatory, which could enhance the identification of such objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet 3I/ATLAS</strong> is one of only three known interstellar comets.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by the <strong>Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</strong> survey.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be over <strong>seven billion years old</strong>, twice the age of our solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS follows a <strong>hyperbolic orbit</strong>, indicating it is not bound to the Sun.</li>
    <li>The upcoming <strong>Vera C Rubin Observatory</strong> will conduct a <strong>10-year survey</strong> of the southern sky.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey. Since then, it has been observed as it travels through our solar system. Currently, the comet is near the Sun's periphery and is expected to become obscured from observation as it moves closer to the Sun. It is anticipated to resurface later in the year for further study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The upcoming Vera C Rubin Observatory could be a game-changer when it comes to identifying more interstellar objects,” said Dr. Matthew Hopkins from the University of Oxford.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects have been identified: 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The rarity of such objects has made them a focal point for astronomers, as studying them can provide insights into the early solar system and the formation of planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and plan to conduct further observations later in the year to gather more data before it exits the solar system.</p>
