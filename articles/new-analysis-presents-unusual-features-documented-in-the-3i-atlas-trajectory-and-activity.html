      <h2>New analysis presents unusual features documented in the 3I/ATLAS trajectory and activity</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shown a series of unusual features in its trajectory and physical behavior as it passed through the inner solar system, according to recent analyses. The findings, including a summary by Harvard Professor Avi Loeb, detail anomalies ranging from highly unlikely to minor deviations from expected cometary behavior.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which exhibits features not consistent with previously observed comets. Researchers have begun detailed documentation of these anomalies to better understand the object’s characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is predicted to approach Jupiter at a distance of 53.445 million kilometers on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The object’s nucleus is approximately one million times more massive than 1I/`Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has displayed sunward jets confirmed by HiRISE images taken near Mars.</li>
    <li>The gas plume around 3I/ATLAS contains higher nickel concentrations compared to known comets.</li>
    <li>Polarimetric measurements show extreme negative polarization not observed in prior interstellar comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent observations have documented a series of anomalies in the trajectory and activity of 3I/ATLAS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In July, August, and November 2025, 3I/ATLAS exhibited a sunward jet or anti-tail.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS's arrival direction aligns within nine degrees of the source of the radio "Wow! Signal."</li>
    <li>Polarimetric measurements have been conducted and reported in peer-reviewed analyses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The dataset on 3I/ATLAS presents a comprehensive inventory of anomalies categorized by probability and significance,” Professor Avi Loeb stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through the inner solar system, following 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unusual features, including its mass and gas composition, suggest it may provide insights into the origins of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS to refine measurements and further classify its unusual features. Further analyses are expected to yield more data on its trajectory and physical properties.</p>
