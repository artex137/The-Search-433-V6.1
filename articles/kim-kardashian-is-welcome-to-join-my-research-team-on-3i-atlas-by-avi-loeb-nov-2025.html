      <h2>Kim Kardashian Invited to Join Research Team on Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb has extended an invitation to Kim Kardashian to join his research team focused on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, as noted in a statement made on November 2025. Loeb, a prominent astrophysicist, revealed details about the comet's unusual characteristics and his desire to share this information with Kardashian during a recent interview.</p>

<p>This invitation comes amid growing interest in 3I/ATLAS, which has displayed anomalies that challenge current scientific understanding. Authorities, including NASA, have been monitoring the comet closely, with the acting administrator responding to public inquiries about the object. The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unique attributes, which may offer insights into the origins of life and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet observed in our solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA's HiRISE camera captured images of 3I/ATLAS on October 2-3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's gas plume has a nickel to cyanide ratio significantly higher than known comets.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will come closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The likelihood of 3I/ATLAS exhibiting non-gravitational acceleration is below 1%.</li>
    <li>Loeb has requested access to data from Professor Alfred McEwen at the University of Arizona.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2-3, 2025, NASA's HiRISE camera captured high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS. Following this, on November 2025, Kim Kardashian tweeted NASA about the comet, prompting a response from acting administrator Sean Duffy. Loeb later expressed his hope to share findings about 3I/ATLAS with Kardashian during a TV interview.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The dissemination of scientific information should not be held hostage to the politics of the government shutdown,” said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Great question! NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” responded Sean Duffy to Kim Kardashian.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant because it presents characteristics that differ from those of typical comets. Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also drawn attention, but 3I/ATLAS exhibits unique features that may provide new insights into cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, scheduled for December 19, 2025, scientists will continue to analyze its data. Investigations into its composition and behavior are expected to yield important findings that could reshape our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
