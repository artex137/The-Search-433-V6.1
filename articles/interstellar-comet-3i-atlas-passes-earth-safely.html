      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Passes Earth Safely</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has passed by Earth safely on December 20, 2025, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles, according to scientists. There were no injuries or fatalities reported, and the comet posed no danger to our planet.</p>

<p>This event has concluded weeks of curiosity about the comet, which is now moving through the solar system. Experts have dismissed rumors suggesting the object could be an alien spacecraft. Authorities are monitoring its trajectory as it approaches Jupiter for a close flyby on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 20, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Next close flyby: Jupiter on March 16, 2026, at about 33 million miles</li>
    <li>Comet discovered: July 2025 using the ATLAS telescope</li>
    <li>Status: confirmed interstellar object, third recorded visitor</li>
    <li>NASA's MAVEN spacecraft around Mars went offline on December 4, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025 using the ATLAS telescope, which is funded by NASA. Over the following months, scientists monitored its trajectory and behavior due to its unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>On December 20, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to Earth, safely passing at a distance of about 170 million miles. After this event, it is expected to fly near Jupiter on March 16, 2026, followed by close passes near Neptune in 2028 and Pluto in April 2029.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>  
    “NASA considers an object potentially hazardous only if it comes within 4.6 million miles, so 3I/ATLAS poses no threat,” officials stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar visitor recorded, following 1I ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and another object discovered afterward. Scientists have closely monitored the comet due to its confirmed status as an interstellar object and its unusual behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its flyby of Jupiter, 3I/ATLAS is expected to continue its trajectory through the solar system, with future close passes near Neptune and Pluto before leaving the solar system in the mid-2030s. NASA continues efforts to restore contact with its MAVEN spacecraft, which went offline unrelated to the comet's passage.</p>
