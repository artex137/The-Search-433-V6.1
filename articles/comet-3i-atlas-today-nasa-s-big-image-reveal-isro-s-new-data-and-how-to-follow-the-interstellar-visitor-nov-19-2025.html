      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Today: NASA’s Big Image Reveal, ISRO’s New Data and How to Follow the Interstellar Visitor</h2>

<p>On Wednesday, November 19, 2025, NASA will unveil its sharpest images yet of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a live media event at 3 p.m. Eastern Time from Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Meanwhile, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has released fresh observations from its Mount Abu telescope, detailing the comet's activity as it moves away from the inner solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights ongoing global efforts to study the comet, which is believed to be over 8 billion years old. Scientists from NASA and ISRO are collaborating to enhance understanding of 3I/ATLAS’s structure and chemistry.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Time:</strong> 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) today, Nov. 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Who’s Speaking:</strong> NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, heliophysics chief Nicky Fox, and other senior scientists</li>
    <li><strong>ISRO Observations:</strong> Conducted with a 1.2-meter telescope at Mount Abu between November 12–15</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> Expected around December 19, 2025, at about 1.8 AU (270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Brightest Observation:</strong> Comet currently has an observed brightness of magnitude 9.8</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first reported on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, with pre-discovery images dating back to mid-June. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun around October 29–30, 2025, at approximately 1.4 AU (203 million km) from the Sun.</p>
<p>ISRO’s observations took place from November 12 to 15, 2025, as the comet moved away from the inner solar system following its perihelion. The live event from NASA is set to provide the latest images and scientific insights.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS adds to our understanding of interstellar objects,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya during a preview of the event.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The observations from Mount Abu show typical active-comet behavior,” noted ISRO’s team as they shared their findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever spotted in the solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates that it comes from deep interstellar space and will not return after its passage through the solar system.</p>
<p>Recent reports suggest that 3I/ATLAS may be older than the solar system itself, with estimates placing its age at around 7 to 8 billion years. This insight is based on its speed and the characteristics of its composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following today’s event, scientists will continue to analyze data from multiple observatories to better understand the comet's chemical composition and activity. Observations will remain ongoing as 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth next month.</p>
