      <h2>Aliens Love Gold As Much as Humans Do</h2>

<p>On July 2, 2013, people around the world are celebrating World UFO Day by sharing stories about alien encounters and monitoring the skies for unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Experts suggest that significant evidence of extraterrestrial life may lie hidden in ancient ruins and at religious sites, particularly at Guatavita in Colombia, known for its gold rituals.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights the ongoing fascination with UFOs and the belief that ancient civilizations may have interacted with extraterrestrial beings. Authorities and researchers continue to explore these ideas, linking historical accounts of gold with potential alien interests.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: July 2, 2013</li>
    <li>Event: World UFO Day</li>
    <li>Location: Guatavita, Colombia, near Bogotá</li>
    <li>Focus: Ancient civilizations, gold rituals, extraterrestrial life</li>
    <li>Key figure: Derrick Pitts, Chief Astronomer at the Franklin Institute</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since the 16th century, the legend of El Dorado has captivated treasure seekers after Spanish conquistadores witnessed a chieftain covered in gold dust dumping precious metals into Lake Guatavita. Modern researchers have linked these gold rituals to theories about extraterrestrial interest in gold.</p>
<p>Many theorists propose that ancient civilizations, such as the Incas in Peru, were influenced by alien visitors, suggesting that temples and rituals were designed to communicate with these beings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Gold is an inert material, it doesn't react with anything. It is a wonderful conductor of electricity… and… a perfect reflector of infrared energy," said Derrick Pitts, Chief Astronomer at the Franklin Institute, in an interview for the History channel series Ancient Aliens.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous theories about alien visitations often reference ancient structures and artifacts as evidence of extraterrestrial contact. The Great Pyramid of Giza is mentioned as a possible ancient reactor used to produce gold, while the sun temple Qurikancha in Cusco, Peru, is noted for its golden disc, believed by some to symbolize a UFO.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to investigate the connections between ancient civilizations and theories of extraterrestrial life, examining historical accounts and archaeological sites for further evidence.</p>
