      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Reappears Without Tail After Passing Behind the Sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reappeared after passing behind the Sun on October 21, 2025, but it has done so without its characteristic tail. The comet, first discovered in July 2025, has drawn attention from astronomers and space enthusiasts due to its unusual behavior and mysterious origins.</p>

<p>This event is significant as scientists aim to understand the comet's composition and behavior. Observations have raised questions about its tail's visibility, leading to speculation about its nature. Authorities, including astronomers from various observatories, are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed behind the Sun on October 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, after ʻOumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>It is expected to make its closest approach to Earth at about 1.8 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate the comet's tail may be obscured from view.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope. The comet was later confirmed to have pre-discovery images dating back to June 2025. On October 21, 2025, the comet passed behind the Sun, entering a solar conjunction. It reached perihelion on October 30, coming within 130 million miles (1.36 astronomical units) of the Sun. Following this, 3I/ATLAS reemerged in November 2025, but without a visible tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comets tend to be their most active when they’re closest to the Sun,” said Qicheng Zhang, a researcher at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. “This period allows astronomers to study their gases and structure in greater detail.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to have been detected. Its predecessors, ʻOumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, have also intrigued scientists with their unique characteristics. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has prompted discussions about the origins of comets and their potential to provide insights into the early solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away from the Sun, astronomers expect to gain better visibility of the comet's gaseous cloud. Researchers will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition over the coming weeks.</p>
