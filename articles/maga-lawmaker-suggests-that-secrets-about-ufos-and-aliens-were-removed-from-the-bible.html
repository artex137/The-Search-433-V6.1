      <h2>MAGA Lawmaker Suggests That Secrets About UFOs And Aliens Were Removed From The Bible</h2>

<p>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) has suggested that information about UFOs and aliens has been omitted from the Bible during a recent appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast. The comments were made on Wednesday as Luna advocated for greater government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>Luna, who leads the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets under the House Oversight Committee, has claimed that traditional perceptions of aliens are incorrect. She stated that she has seen evidence of technology created by what she termed “energy things” or “interdimensional beings.” Her remarks have sparked discussions about the government's role in disclosing information related to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast on Wednesday.</li>
    <li>Luna leads the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna discussed her views on UFOs and government secrecy during an interview on Joe Rogan's podcast. She mentioned her role leading a task force focused on declassifying federal secrets related to UAPs. Luna recounted her experiences in the Air Force and described incidents involving UAP sightings by military pilots.</p>

<p>Luna indicated that her task force was formed after she, along with Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) and former Rep. Matt Gaetz, investigated reports of UAPs, claiming that military authorities have attempted to cover up these sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Transparency is what builds trust,” Luna said regarding government secrecy about alien technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“To think that we are the only, you know, life form on this planet, in this galaxy, I think is a little bit crazy,” Luna added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around UFOs and government transparency has gained momentum in recent years, particularly following the release of videos by the U.S. military showing UAPs. Public interest in this topic has been heightened by ongoing debates about government accountability and the sharing of information with the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
