      <h2>Nasa's TESS captures 3I/ATLAS once again. But some data is missing. Here's what happened</h2>

<p>NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS between January 15 and 22, 2026, while it moves away from the Sun. A technical issue during the imaging period has resulted in some data being missing.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it continues to provide insights into the comet's characteristics and trajectory. TESS has previously recorded 3I/ATLAS, and scientists are eager to analyze the data despite the interruption caused by the satellite's technical difficulties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed from January 15 to 22, 2026</li>
  <li>TESS created a 28-hour-long video of the comet</li>
  <li>Data was interrupted from January 15 to 18, 2026, due to technical issues</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025</li>
  <li>TESS recorded the comet as early as May 2025</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS will come close to Jupiter's Hill Radius on March 16, 2026</li>
  <li>Juno spacecraft will observe the comet from 53.6 million kilometres away</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's TESS captured images of 3I/ATLAS starting on January 15, 2026. The satellite faced a technical issue between January 15 and 18, which interrupted data collection. Following this, TESS continued to observe the comet until January 22, 2026. The Hubble Space Telescope also observed 3I/ATLAS between November 30, 2025, and January 22, 2026, allowing scientists to study its composition.</p>

<p>Earlier, TESS recorded 3I/ATLAS over 20 days between May 7 and June 1, 2025. The comet was officially discovered on July 1, 2025, but TESS had captured it as early as May 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“TESS has a wide field of view and scans the sky for a month at a time,” said Daniel Muthukrishna, a TESS team member from MIT, who compiled the available images into a 28-hour video.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated considerable interest among scientists due to its unique trajectory and characteristics. The comet's proximity to Jupiter in March 2026 will provide an opportunity for further observation, particularly regarding the gravitational effects experienced within Jupiter's Hill Radius.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from TESS and Hubble. The Juno spacecraft is set to observe 3I/ATLAS on March 16, 2026, as it approaches Jupiter's Hill Radius.</p>
