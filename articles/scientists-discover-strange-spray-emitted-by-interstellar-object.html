      <h2>Scientists Discover Strange Spray Emitted by Interstellar Object</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention from astronomers due to its unexpected behavior, emitting large amounts of water vapor at a rate of about 40 kilograms per second. This discovery was made using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift space telescope and has raised questions about the comet's characteristics and formation.</p>

<p>The findings are important because they suggest that fundamental ingredients for life may not be limited to our solar system. Researchers are currently analyzing the implications of this discovery and how it may change our understanding of comet behavior and formation processes in different star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Emission Rate: 3I/ATLAS emits water vapor at approximately <strong>88 pounds (40 kilograms)</strong> per second.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: The comet is located about <strong>three astronomical units (AU)</strong> from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Current Position: 3I/ATLAS is currently positioned behind the Sun, limiting visibility from Earth.</li>
    <li>Expected Visibility: The comet is set to return to full view by <strong>late November</strong>.</li>
    <li>Age Estimate: 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be billions of years old, possibly predating the Sun by <strong>three billion years</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent observations have shown that 3I/ATLAS has been emitting water vapor at a significant rate, which is unusual for a comet located at its current distance from the Sun. The study detailing these findings was published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Researchers utilized NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift space telescope to collect data on the comet's emissions.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, astronomers anticipate further insights into its characteristics and the mysteries surrounding interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This discovery suggests that the fundamental ingredients for life are not exclusive to our solar system,” said Dennis Bodewits, a physics professor at Auburn University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Lead author Zexi Xing noted, “Every interstellar comet observed so far has defied expectations.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS exhibits a unique carbon dioxide to water ratio, which differs significantly from local comets. This unusual chemistry raises questions about the comet's origins and formation history, with astronomers theorizing that it may have originated from the center of the Milky Way and was ejected from its star system by a gravitational disturbance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible again in late November. Ongoing observations will help clarify the mechanisms behind its water emissions and further our understanding of interstellar comets.</p>
