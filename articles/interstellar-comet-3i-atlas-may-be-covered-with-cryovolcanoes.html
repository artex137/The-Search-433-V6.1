      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be covered with cryovolcanoes</h2>

<p>Analysis of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has revealed that this celestial body may be covered with erupting ice structures known as cryovolcanoes. Researchers have tracked the comet from July to November 2025 as it approached the Sun, providing a rare opportunity to study an object that formed in another star system.</p>

<p>This discovery could challenge existing theories about the formation of comets in our Solar System. Scientists believe that the untouched nature of 3I/ATLAS, which has never been close enough to a star to undergo significant heating or change, offers insights into the early solar system conditions and the evolution of small celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was tracked from July to November 2025.</li>
    <li>Researchers have identified cryovolcanic activity on the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet's internal composition is rich in metals like iron and nickel.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS does not have a protective dust mantle, allowing for water ice activation.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibited a sharp burst of brightness when it was 2.5 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Study published on the arXiv preprint server by an international team of scientists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, scientists began tracking comet 3I/ATLAS as it approached the Solar System. Observations continued until November 2025, during which researchers noted significant changes in the comet's brightness and surface activity. A key observation occurred when the comet was 2.5 AU from the Sun, showing a prolonged burst of brightness interpreted as cryovolcanic activity.</p>

<p>The analysis revealed that the comet lacks a protective dust mantle, which is common in other comets and allows for the activation of its water ice layer. This unique characteristic has led to new insights into the comet's internal structure and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This metal-rich composition helps explain the comet’s powerful cryovolcanic activity,” researchers stated. “As the surface heated up and ice turned into water, the liquid began to corrode the small metal grains inside the comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The findings regarding 3I/ATLAS challenge standard models of comet formation, which typically suggest that comets consist of ice, rock, and low concentrations of metals. Previous studies have shown that comets in our Solar System are primarily powered by solar heating of surface ice.</p>

<p>The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS may provide valuable information about the chemical evolution of small bodies in planetary systems and could lead to a reevaluation of current theories regarding the origins of comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data collected from comet 3I/ATLAS to further understand its composition and activity. Future observations may help clarify the implications of this comet on our knowledge of planetary system formation.</p>
