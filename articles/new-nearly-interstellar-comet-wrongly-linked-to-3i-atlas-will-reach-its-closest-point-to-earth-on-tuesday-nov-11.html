      <h2>New 'nearly interstellar' comet, wrongly linked to 3I/ATLAS, will reach its closest point to Earth on Tuesday (Nov. 11)</h2>

<p>A newly discovered comet, named C/2025 V1 (Borisov), will reach its closest approach to Earth on Tuesday, November 11, at a distance of 64 million miles (103 million kilometers). The comet was first spotted on November 2 by amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov in Crimea. There have been rumors linking this comet to the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, but experts have confirmed that the two are not related.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as C/2025 V1 is described as a "nearly interstellar object" due to its unusual trajectory. Authorities and astronomers are monitoring its approach and advising stargazers on how to view it, as it may be visible with the aid of telescopes or binoculars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 V1 (Borisov) will approach Earth on November 11.</li>
    <li>It will reach a minimum distance of 64 million miles (103 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on November 2 by Gennadiy Borisov.</li>
    <li>It has an apparent magnitude of 13.8, making it too faint for the naked eye.</li>
    <li>C/2025 V1 is located in the constellation Virgo.</li>
    <li>Its closest point to the sun (perihelion) is on November 16.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 2, 2023, Gennadiy Borisov discovered comet C/2025 V1 while it was heading toward Earth. Rumors began circulating about a potential link between C/2025 V1 and 3I/ATLAS. However, experts quickly clarified that the two comets are not related. C/2025 V1 will reach its closest point to Earth on November 11, followed by perihelion on November 16.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “C/2025 V1 is not related to 3I/ATLAS if it did not employ non-gravitational propulsion,” said astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who has commented on the similarities and differences between the two comets.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The confusion surrounding C/2025 V1 and 3I/ATLAS stems from their similar characteristics. Both comets travel through the solar system at high speeds and have unusual orbital paths. C/2025 V1 is suspected to originate from the Oort Cloud, a distant region filled with icy objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe C/2025 V1 as it approaches Earth, providing updates on its visibility and characteristics. The comet's origin and trajectory will be further analyzed after its closest approach.</p>
