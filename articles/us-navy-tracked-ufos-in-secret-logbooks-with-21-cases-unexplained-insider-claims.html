      <h2>US Navy tracked UFOs in secret logbooks with 21 cases unexplained, insider claims</h2>

<p>A former submarine technician has alleged that the US Navy has documented high-speed unidentified objects in secret logbooks, with 21 unexplained UFO encounters reported in 2024. The US government acknowledged these findings after Congress obtained a report from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), detailing witness testimonies that have undergone investigation.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as it raises questions about the nature of these unidentified phenomena and the Navy's tracking methods. The AARO is currently working to analyze the cases and has stated that it will notify Congress if any discoveries indicate advanced foreign aerospace capabilities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>21 unexplained UFO encounters documented in 2024.</li>
  <li>Report obtained by Congress from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).</li>
  <li>Fast movers are unidentified aerial or submerged objects detected by military equipment.</li>
  <li>Incidents include sightings of a green fireball and a 6ft rocket.</li>
  <li>AARO has found no evidence of extraterrestrial beings or advanced foreign technologies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2024, a document was disclosed revealing 21 unexplained UFO encounters tracked by the US Navy. The report was obtained by Congress from the AARO, which has been investigating these phenomena. A Reddit user, known as Dabier, claimed to have learned about these records from a retired Cold War submarine veteran, who described log entries of unidentified contacts made during sonar operations.</p>

<p>The AARO has indicated that it is working closely with the Intelligence Community and Science and Technology partners to analyze the outstanding cases that merit further investigation. The AARO will provide immediate notification to Congress if any significant findings arise.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology," AARO stated.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"None of these resolved cases substantiated advanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies," AARO added.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Former NASA Associate Administrator for Space Policy Mike Gold cautioned the House of Representatives, stating, "the truth is out there" and urged NASA to track suspected UFO flight paths.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This report follows a series of incidents involving unexplained aerial phenomena, prompting increased scrutiny of military tracking practices and government transparency regarding UFOs. Previous reports have included various sightings, some later identified as ordinary objects, while others remain unresolved.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO continues to analyze the 21 cases and will inform Congress of any findings that suggest breakthroughs in foreign aerospace capabilities. Further investigations are expected as the agency collaborates with its partners in the Intelligence Community and Science and Technology sectors.</p>
