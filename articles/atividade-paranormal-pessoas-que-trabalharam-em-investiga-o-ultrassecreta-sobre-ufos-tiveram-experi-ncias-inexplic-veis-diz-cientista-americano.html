      <h2>Paranormal activity: former workers of a secret UFO investigation report 'inexplicable' experiences, says American scientist</h2>

<p>James Lacatski, an intelligence analyst who worked with the U.S. Defense Agency, has stated that individuals who encountered UFOs have reported various paranormal experiences following their encounters. Lacatski claims he saw a creature resembling a wolf walking on two legs after leaving the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (AAWSAP), a secretive U.S. government project managed by the Defense Intelligence Agency that investigated unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>The AAWSAP, which ran from 2008 to 2010, has seen several of its scientists report unsettling experiences. According to Lacatski, these individuals have been suffering from what he calls the "passenger effect," despite having left Nevada, the program’s base, long ago. Some have reported seeing light orbs, shadows, and bizarre creatures. Lacatski raised questions about the persistence of these experiences, asking, “Did these things take a train or a plane to Washington, where one of the scientists lived?”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>James Lacatski is a former intelligence analyst at the U.S. Defense Agency.</li>
    <li>AAWSAP operated from 2008 to 2010, focusing on UFO technology and psychological effects.</li>
    <li>The program was initiated after sightings reported in northeastern Utah.</li>
    <li>Robert Bigelow’s Bigelow Ranch served as a primary study site for the program.</li>
    <li>Lacatski has published books on the covert UFO program and its implications.</li>
    <li>He claims that UFOs are extraterrestrial in origin and that there is a global race for reverse engineering this technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The AAWSAP was launched in 2008 to investigate technology related to UFOs and quickly expanded to study the psychological effects on witnesses. The program concluded in 2010.</p>
<p>Reports of sightings in northeastern Utah prompted the initiation of the program, which included significant contributions from Robert Bigelow, a noted aerospace businessman.</p>
<p>James Lacatski has recently shared his experiences, highlighting the ongoing interest in the phenomena associated with UFO sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are not dealing with humans,” Lacatski stated in a recent interview with CBS, asserting that the UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The AAWSAP is part of a broader effort to understand unidentified aerial phenomena, which have been a topic of increasing interest among governments and researchers. The initiative has been linked to ongoing discussions about the classification and disclosure of government documents related to non-human intelligence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the psychological and technological aspects of UFO encounters are expected to continue, with calls for further transparency and research in this field. The implications of Lacatski's claims may prompt renewed interest in government disclosures related to UAPs.</p>
