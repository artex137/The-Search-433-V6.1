      <h2>ESA’s Juice probe captures unprecedented image of active interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes through 2025</h2>

<p>The Agência Espacial Europeia (ESA) has released a preliminary image from its Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) probe, showcasing the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in remarkable activity. The image was taken on November 2, 2025, just after the comet's perihelion and approximately 66 million kilometers from the celestial body.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it offers a unique glimpse into the characteristics of an interstellar comet. The Juice mission, launched in April 2023, aims to study the icy moons of Jupiter, but the opportunity to observe 3I/ATLAS arose unexpectedly. The probe has utilized multiple scientific instruments to gather extensive data on the comet's morphology and chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from comet: Approximately 66 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 20, 2025</li>
    <li>Next Jupiter flyby: March 2026</li>
    <li>Juice probe launched: April 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by an ATLAS system telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. It completed its perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.2 astronomical units from the Sun. The Juice probe captured its first image of the comet on November 2, 2025, and continued gathering data until November 25, 2025.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 20, 2025, followed by a flyby of Jupiter in March 2026. These events will provide further opportunities for observation and analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The navigation camera has proven to be a valuable tool for observing distant objects," said a representative from ESA. "This image is just the beginning of what we hope to learn about 3I/ATLAS and its origins."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object in the Solar System. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates it originated from outside the Solar System, with astronomers confirming its interstellar nature through trajectory calculations. The comet's behavior, including an exit velocity exceeding 26 km/s after its passage through the Sun, aligns with characteristics typical of non-gravitationally bound objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Juice probe will continue its planned trajectory, including a flyby of Venus in August 2025 and another of Earth in 2026. The scientific data collected from 3I/ATLAS is expected to arrive on Earth in February 2026, allowing for in-depth analysis of the comet's composition and dynamics.</p>
