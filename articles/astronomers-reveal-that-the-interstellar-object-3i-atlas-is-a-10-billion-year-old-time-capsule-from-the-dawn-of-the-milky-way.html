      <h2>Astronomers Reveal that the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Is a 10-Billion-Year-Old Time Capsule from the Dawn of the Milky Way</h2>

<p>A research team from the Research Center in Information and Communication Technologies (CITIC) at the University of A Coruña has reconstructed the orbital history of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object detected in our Solar System, following its discovery on July 1, 2025, through the ATLAS survey system in Chile.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it provides insights into the evolution of objects from other stellar systems, which had only been theorized until now. The study is available in the open-access repository arXiv and has been submitted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Outside the Sun’s gravitational influence</li>
    <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> Approximately 58 kilometers per second (more than 200,000 kilometers per hour)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> About 10 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Research Team Lead:</strong> Xabier Pérez Couto, CITIC</li>
    <li><strong>Data Source:</strong> Gaia mission of the European Space Agency</li>
    <li><strong>Potential Stellar Interactions:</strong> 93 identified, with 62 having high statistical confidence</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS survey system in Chile. The comet's hyperbolic orbit confirmed its extrasolar origin. Following its discovery, the CITIC research team began analyzing its trajectory over the past 10 million years.</p>
<p>Using data from the Gaia mission, the researchers conducted a backward orbital integration to identify potential close encounters with stars in the Milky Way. Their analysis revealed that 3I/ATLAS has traversed the galaxy largely unperturbed by gravitational influences.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “What makes 3I/ATLAS unique is that it allows us to study the evolution of objects originating in other stellar systems—something we could only theorize about until now,” said Xabier Pérez Couto, CITIC researcher and head of the team.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discoveries of two previous interstellar objects, 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The detection of such objects, though predicted by theoretical models, remains rare due to the observational challenges involved.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The CITIC team anticipates that future discoveries of interstellar objects will enhance understanding of galactic patterns and the formation of planetary systems. The next generation of observatories, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is expected to facilitate the detection of more interstellar messengers.</p>
