      <h2>3I/ATLAS Stirring to Life Before Closest Approach to Earth Revealed In NASA, ESA Newest Images</h2>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) have released new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, confirming a significant increase in activity as the object prepares for its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This development is important as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study material from beyond the Solar System. Authorities are currently analyzing the increased activity of 3I/ATLAS, which is undergoing a transformation marked by eruptions of gas and dust.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> 29 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed at Perihelion:</strong> Approximately 246,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Distance of Anti-Tail:</strong> More than 60,000 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Third Confirmed Interstellar Object:</strong> After 'Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023, marking it as the third interstellar object identified. The comet achieved its closest orbital point to the Sun on 29 October 2025, during which NASA recorded an increase in its speed relative to the Sun. Recent images released by NASA and ESA show a dramatic increase in activity, with gas and dust erupting from the comet as it approaches the inner solar system.</p>

<p>As of now, scientists are closely monitoring the object, particularly in light of its upcoming closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, noted, “The rotational gradient map of the new Hubble image of the interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS... shows evidence for two jets, with a clear anti-tail extending out to more than 60,000 kilometers in the direction of the Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 'Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates that it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun and will eventually leave the Solar System. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS offer scientists a chance to study material from another star's planetary system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists and astronomers will continue to analyze 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with the goal of determining whether it is a natural comet or an object of another nature. Observations will intensify leading up to its closest approach.</p>
