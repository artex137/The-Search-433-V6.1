      <h2>3I/ATLAS is 'Surprising Us': NASA Experts Investigate Color Shift Anomaly</h2>

<p>An interstellar visitor, comet 3I/ATLAS, is presenting scientists with a series of puzzles as it exhibits a strange new blue colour and unexpected acceleration not caused by gravity, according to experts. Researchers from multiple space agencies are racing to understand the comet's peculiar behaviour as new images and data emerge.</p>

<p>This investigation into 3I/ATLAS matters because it poses fundamental questions about the nature of interstellar objects. Scientists are examining the changing colour and acceleration patterns to gain insights into the chemical processes at play and the comet's origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS shows a distinct blue hue, previously appearing red and green.</li>
    <li>Its perihelion occurred around 30 October 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>China's Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter has captured images of the comet from Martian orbit.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project resumed Earth-based observations on 5 November 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been under observation as it approached the Sun. It exhibited a colour shift that scientists have noted, changing from red and green to blue. This shift has raised questions about the gases present in its coma. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun around 30 October 2023.</p>

<p>As it continues its journey, the comet has begun to show signs of non-gravitational acceleration, prompting further investigation from researchers. Multiple space agencies, including China's Tianwen-1, have provided data to build a comprehensive understanding of its activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is surprising us,” said a NASA expert involved in the investigation. “Its behaviour is challenging our understanding of these celestial travellers.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third interstellar object detected to date. The comet travels on a hyperbolic trajectory, which means it will pass by the Sun once before continuing into deep space. Previous interstellar objects have provided insights into the composition and behaviour of celestial bodies from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research teams will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it emerges from behind the Sun. Detailed analysis of its colour and acceleration patterns will help scientists draw conclusions about the comet's fundamental nature and chemical processes at play.</p>
