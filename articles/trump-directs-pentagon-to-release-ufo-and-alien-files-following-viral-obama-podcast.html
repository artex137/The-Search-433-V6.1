      <h2>Trump Directs Pentagon to Release UFO and Alien Files Following Viral Obama Podcast</h2>

<p>President Trump has announced he is directing the Pentagon and other federal agencies to identify and release all government files related to UFOs, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and extraterrestrial life. The announcement was made on February 20, 2026, via a social media post.</p>

<p>This directive follows a surge of public interest in UAPs, particularly after former President Barack Obama discussed the topic in a recent podcast. Trump has accused Obama of revealing classified information regarding aliens and UAPs during that interview.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump's announcement was made on February 20, 2026.</li>
    <li>The directive includes all government files related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>Obama's podcast appearance occurred on February 14, 2026.</li>
    <li>Trump did not provide a timeline for the release of files.</li>
    <li>Obama stated he saw no evidence of extraterrestrial contact during his presidency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2026, former President Barack Obama participated in a podcast interview where he addressed speculation about UFOs and stated, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them.”</p>
<p>On February 19, 2026, Trump criticized Obama, claiming he had disclosed classified information regarding aliens. Trump stated, “He made a big mistake giving out classified information.”</p>
<p>The following day, February 20, 2026, Trump announced his directive for the Pentagon to release UFO-related files.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs),” Trump wrote.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>“He’s not supposed to be doing that. He made a big mistake giving out classified information,” Trump said regarding Obama’s comments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>Obama later clarified that his remarks were based on the statistical likelihood of life existing elsewhere in the universe, not on any classified briefing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This directive taps into increasing public interest in UAPs, which has grown since 2017 when the Pentagon acknowledged a previously secret program studying unidentified aerial encounters reported by military pilots. Congressional hearings in 2023 featured testimony from former intelligence officials about alleged government possession of non-human craft, although the Pentagon has disputed these claims.</p>
<p>A 2024 report from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) concluded that there is no verifiable evidence that the U.S. government or private industry has ever possessed extraterrestrial technology or had contact with alien life, reviewing investigations dating back to 1945.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has been tasked with identifying and releasing the relevant files, although no timeline has been provided for when this will occur.</p>
