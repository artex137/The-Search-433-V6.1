      <h2>A Radiant Alien: The Interstellar Comet Blazing Through Our Solar System</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest recorded approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometres. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This close encounter provides a unique opportunity for scientists to study the comet and its emissions. The comet, only the third interstellar visitor detected in our solar system, has exhibited intense X-ray radiation, which has generated significant interest among astronomers. The European Space Agency's XMM-Newton observatory and the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) have been utilized to gather data on this rare object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
<li>It reached a distance of approximately 270 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
<li>The comet emits X-ray radiation extending up to 400,000 kilometres.</li>
<li>Observations were conducted by ESA's XMM-Newton and NASA's XRISM.</li>
<li>Distinct spectral signatures of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen have been identified.</li>
<li>The comet is expected to pass near Jupiter in the coming months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered earlier in 2023 and has been under observation since its detection. The comet reached its perigee on December 19, 2023, allowing for detailed study of its emissions.</p>
<p>In early December, while the comet was approximately 285 million kilometres from XMM-Newton, observations confirmed the X-ray emissions detected by XRISM.</p>
<p>As the comet moves away from the inner solar system, it is scheduled to pass near Jupiter, where researchers plan to utilize NASA's Juno spacecraft for further investigation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
“We are witnessing an unprecedented opportunity to study an interstellar comet in detail. The data we have gathered will enhance our understanding of these rare visitors from other star systems.” – ESA representative
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous encounters with these objects provided limited data, making the current observations of 3I/ATLAS particularly significant for planetary science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue observing 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. They aim to conduct a flyby study using NASA's Juno spacecraft, marking a novel approach to studying an interstellar object with a mission designed for planetary science.</p>
