      <h2>Alien Contactees Discuss 3I/Atlas in NYC Virtual Meeting</h2>

<p>A virtual meeting for individuals who claim to have experienced extraterrestrial encounters took place on November 14, 2023, led by Catherine Chapey from Holtsville, Long Island. The gathering, which has evolved from a small local group to a network of thousands, allowed participants to share their stories about alleged abductions and contact with alien beings. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the meeting or its discussions.</p>

<p>This event highlights the growing acceptance of UFO-related experiences in mainstream culture. The recent appearance of 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object, has sparked renewed interest and debate about the existence of extraterrestrial life. The meeting served as a support group for those who feel isolated due to their experiences, as many participants have faced skepticism from friends and family.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: November 14, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Virtual meeting, participants from various locations including Japan and New Zealand</li>
    <li>Organizer: Catherine Chapey, former electrician and ordained interspiritual minister</li>
    <li>Number of participants: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Focus of discussion: 3I/Atlas and its implications for extraterrestrial life</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Participants joined the Zoom meeting starting at 7 p.m. to discuss their personal experiences with extraterrestrial encounters. Each attendee shared stories over a period of two hours, with Chapey facilitating the discussion.</p>
<p>Throughout the meeting, various participants, including a Realtor from Florida and a medical worker from Colorado, recounted their encounters and theories regarding the nature of 3I/Atlas.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This isn’t something you talk about with your family,” said Mary, a participant from New York’s Finger Lakes region, reflecting on the stigma surrounding such experiences.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When you go through something like [this], people drop out of your life,” Chapey explained, emphasizing the isolation many feel after sharing their experiences.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The meeting comes amid increasing public interest in UFO phenomena. A YouGov poll indicated that belief in UFO sightings rose from 20% in 1996 to 34% in 2022. The Department of Defense's release of UAP footage has also contributed to this trend.</p>
<p>Chapey's personal journey into spirituality and her ordination in 2019 have positioned her as a leader for those seeking validation for their experiences. She aims to create a supportive environment for “spiritual experiencers.”</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions around 3I/Atlas continue, participants and researchers alike are expected to further investigate its origins and implications. The ongoing debate between scientists and UFO enthusiasts will likely shape future gatherings and discussions.</p>
