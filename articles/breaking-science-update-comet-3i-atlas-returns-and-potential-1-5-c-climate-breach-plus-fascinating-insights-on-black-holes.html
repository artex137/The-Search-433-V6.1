      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth Amid Climate Warnings</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, a significant interstellar visitor, has been detected as it approaches the Sun, with scientists closely monitoring its path. This comet, measuring approximately 11 kilometers in diameter, is traveling at a speed of 210,000 km/h and has recently become brighter, shedding its highly irradiated coma.</p>

<p>The return of Comet 3I/ATLAS is important for scientific research, as it is believed to be over 7 billion years old. Data gathered from this comet could enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. In conjunction with this event, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has warned that global temperatures are projected to exceed the critical 1.5°C threshold for climate change before 2035, highlighting urgent global climate concerns.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 11 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>It is traveling at a speed of 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>The comet is believed to be over 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>The UNEP projects that global temperatures may exceed 1.5°C before 2035.</li>
    <li>Current emissions trends threaten to exhaust Earth’s carbon budget in three years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been tracked as it approaches the Sun, becoming significantly brighter and changing colors. Scientists have noted its increased visibility and are preparing to study it further.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the UNEP has issued climate projections that indicate a concerning trend in global temperature increases. This warning comes as world leaders are urged to take immediate action to meet climate goals established in the Paris Agreement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The data gathered from this comet could reveal valuable insights about its native star system,” a scientist noted regarding the significance of Comet 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Current trends indicate a significant failure to meet climate targets,” stated a UNEP representative, emphasizing the urgency for global leaders.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aimed to limit global warming to below 1.5°C. However, recent projections suggest that without drastic changes in emissions, this target may be unattainable.</p>
<p>Research on black holes has also gained attention, with physicist Jonas Enander discussing the gravitational forces involved. Understanding these phenomena remains a complex challenge for scientists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Meanwhile, global leaders are urged to implement strategies to address rising greenhouse gas emissions and prevent exceeding the 1.5°C threshold.</p>
