      <h2>Stunning image shows interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shooting a jet toward Sun, intriguing astronomers</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed ejecting ice and dust as it approaches the Sun, according to findings reported by the Astronomer's Telegram. The image was captured using the Two-meter Twin Telescope at Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Canary Islands, revealing a faint jet directed toward the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers as it enhances the understanding of comet behavior and the dynamics of interstellar objects. The comet is currently within 1.8 astronomical units of Earth, making it visible to small telescopes. Observations of 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into its composition and activity as it nears the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently within 1.8 astronomical units from Earth.</li>
    <li>The image was captured at Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Canary Islands.</li>
    <li>The jet observed is estimated to extend up to 6,200 miles from the comet's surface.</li>
    <li>The observation combined 159 exposures of 50 seconds each.</li>
    <li>The comet's behavior resembles that of comets in the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has passed through our solar system, and recent observations have yielded new findings about its activity. The comet was first detected in late 2020, and its close approach to the Sun has led to increased visibility.</p>
<p>The image captured at Teide Observatory provides crucial data on the comet's ejecting materials, which are influenced by solar heat. As the comet rotates, the jets of material can fan out, creating distinct features.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS reemerges from behind the Sun, astronomers anticipate observing changes that could clarify existing theories about the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is the usual,” said Miquel Serra-Ricart, astrophysicist and chief science officer at the Light Bridges private research institution. “Jets are pointing to [the] sunward direction and [the] comet's tail in the anti-solar direction.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS adds to a growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar comets. Previous observations, such as those of comet C/2020 F3 NEOWISE, have shown similar jet formations. The scientific community has been keen to examine such phenomena to better understand the characteristics of celestial objects from beyond the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory, astronomers will monitor its movements and changes in behavior. Future observations will help clarify its composition and address lingering theories about its origin and nature.</p>
