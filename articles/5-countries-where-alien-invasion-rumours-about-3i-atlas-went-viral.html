      <h2>5 countries where alien invasion rumours about 3I/ATLAS went viral</h2>

<p>As the interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> moves through the Solar System, reports of alien invasion have surged in five countries, leading to a wave of speculation. These rumours have gained traction on social media platforms, particularly TikTok and X (formerly Twitter), since early October 2025.</p>

<p>The surge in interest surrounding 3I/ATLAS has prompted authorities, including NASA and the Italian Space Agency, to issue statements to clarify the comet's nature and dispel misinformation. The rapid spread of these theories reflects a growing fascination with extraterrestrial life and the impact of social media on public perception.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Countries affected:</strong> United States, India, Brazil, Japan, Italy</li>
    <li><strong>Date of reports:</strong> October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Social media platforms:</strong> TikTok, X, WhatsApp, YouTube</li>
    <li><strong>Authorities responding:</strong> NASA, Italian Space Agency</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October 2025, amateur astronomers began posting sightings of 3I/ATLAS on various social media platforms. This sparked a rapid spread of theories and memes concerning possible alien encounters.</p>
<p>By mid-October, speculation had escalated, particularly in the United States and India, where viral content led to increased Google searches for terms like “alien comet.”</p>
<p>In response, NASA issued multiple statements aimed at calming public fears, while the Italian Space Agency released a press note to debunk myths circulating in the media.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We want to assure the public that 3I/ATLAS is a comet and poses no threat. The excitement around it is understandable, but we urge people to rely on verified information.” — NASA spokesperson</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Misinformation can spread quickly. We are here to clarify that there is no evidence linking 3I/ATLAS to extraterrestrial life.” — Italian Space Agency</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time that an astronomical event has led to public speculation about alien life. Previous incidents, such as the arrival of <strong>'Oumuamua</strong>, have similarly ignited conspiracy theories. The rise of social media has significantly accelerated the pace at which such theories can spread.</p>
<p>Recent trends indicate an increasing public interest in space exploration and the possibility of extraterrestrial encounters, often fueled by popular culture and online discourse.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities plan to continue monitoring the situation and providing updates as necessary. Investigations into the spread of misinformation may also take place to better understand its impact on public perception.</p>
