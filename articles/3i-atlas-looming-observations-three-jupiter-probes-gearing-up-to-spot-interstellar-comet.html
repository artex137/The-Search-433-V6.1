      <h2>3I/ATLAS looming observations - Three Jupiter probes gearing up to spot interstellar comet</h2>

<p>Scientists have announced that at least four spacecraft will have opportunities to observe the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in the coming weeks as it approaches the Sun. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29-30, during which time it will be invisible from Earth.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides a rare chance to study an interstellar object and its characteristics. The European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA are preparing their respective probes to gather data on the comet's tail and composition during this unique event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach its nearest point to the Sun on October 29-30.</li>
    <li>The maximum viewing opportunity occurs in late October.</li>
    <li>ESA's Hera spacecraft will encounter 3I/ATLAS between October 25 and November 1.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper will pass through the comet's tail between October 30 and November 6.</li>
    <li>JUICE will observe 3I/ATLAS in November but will not provide data until February 2024.</li>
    <li>NASA's Juno probe could approach the comet in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is currently moving through the solar system and will soon reach its closest point to the Sun. The comet's maximum visibility will occur in late October, coinciding with several spacecraft's observational windows.</p>
<p>ESA's Hera spacecraft will encounter the comet between October 25 and November 1, while Europa Clipper will pass through the comet's tail from October 30 to November 6. JUICE is expected to observe the comet in November, but its data will not be available until February 2024. NASA's Juno probe could make a close approach to 3I/ATLAS in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Europa Clipper has a rare opportunity to sample an interstellar object’s tail,” the authors of the recent paper wrote.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS is part of ongoing efforts to study interstellar objects as they enter the solar system. Previous missions have provided valuable data on asteroids and comets, and this event offers a unique opportunity to gather information on an interstellar comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the observations in late October, ESA and NASA will analyze the data collected from the various spacecraft. The Juno probe's potential approach in March 2026 will also be closely monitored for further insights into the comet's characteristics before it exits the solar system.</p>
