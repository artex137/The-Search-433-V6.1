      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to disappear from our sight for a bit, say astronomers</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, is set to vanish from the view of Earth-based observers in late October 2025. The Sun will obscure the comet, making it invisible until early December 2025, according to reports from IFLScience and BBC Sky at Night Magazine.</p>

<p>This disappearance is significant because it limits opportunities for researchers to study the comet at its peak activity. Astronomers are exploring the possibility of using spacecraft positioned at Mars, Jupiter, and the Sun to observe the comet during this period. The comet is unique as it may be a remnant from the Milky Way galaxy's "cosmic noon," suggesting it could be up to 13 billion years old.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will disappear from view in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>It will reappear when it comes close to the Sun from Earth's perspective.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently several degrees away from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar comet detected in the solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is moving at twice the speed of the previous interstellar comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Soon after, it was confirmed as an interstellar object, exciting the scientific community. The comet has been observed to change colour from red to green, raising interest in its composition and origins.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches late October 2025, it will move to the opposite side of the Sun, making it invisible to Earth-based telescopes. Experts will then focus on using existing spacecraft to capture data during the comet's peak activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If confirmed, 3I will provide a means to explore the stellar and planetesimal formation process, and its astrobiological implications, in an early period of galactic history,” the research team stated in a paper published in Earth and Planetary Astrophysics.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar comet detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS is believed to originate from a thick disk of the Milky Way, while the others came from a thin disk. Its unique speed and recent colour change have sparked further investigation into its origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS through various spacecraft, including NASA's Juno and MAVEN missions, as well as ESA's Solar Orbiter. They aim to gather as much data as possible during the comet's peak activity, which will occur when it is closest to the Sun.</p>
