      <h2>UAP witnesses criticize Pentagon UFO office in Congressional hearing for 'using science and coming up with answers'</h2>

<p>Witnesses at a Congressional hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) have criticized the Pentagon's UFO office for its scientific approach to investigating these incidents. The hearing took place on <strong>October 10, 2023</strong>, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it highlights ongoing concerns about the government's transparency and response to UAP sightings. Lawmakers and witnesses have called for a more open investigation into these phenomena, emphasizing the need for comprehensive answers from the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: October 10, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Agency involved: Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Multiple UAP witnesses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Congressional hearing was convened to address concerns surrounding UAP investigations by the Pentagon. Witnesses presented their experiences and expressed frustration over the AARO's methods.</p>
<p>During the hearing, several witnesses criticized the office for relying heavily on scientific explanations rather than addressing the broader implications of UAP encounters. They argued that this approach limits the understanding of the phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We need answers, not just scientific data. The public deserves to know what is happening in our skies,” a witness stated during the hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The AARO must expand its investigation to include all aspects of UAP encounters, not just the scientific narrative,” another witness emphasized.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing reflects a growing trend among lawmakers and the public for increased transparency regarding UAP sightings. Previous incidents have raised questions about national security and public safety, prompting calls for more thorough investigations.</p>
<p>Past Congressional hearings on UAPs have typically focused on military encounters and their implications. However, this recent hearing has shifted the focus to the methods and accountability of the AARO.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO is expected to review the feedback from the hearing and consider adjustments to its investigative approach. Further Congressional hearings may be scheduled to continue discussions on UAP transparency and accountability.
