      <h2>NASA’s TESS Spotted Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Two Months Before Its Official Discovery</h2>

<p>NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has detected interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on May 7, 2025, nearly two months before its official discovery in early July 2025. The comet was already active during this initial observation, providing scientists with valuable data about a visitor from beyond the solar system.</p>

<p>This early detection is significant as it allows researchers to study the comet's behavior and composition before its formal discovery. TESS, primarily designed for exoplanet detection, utilized a novel technique called "shift-stacking" to identify 3I/ATLAS in dense star fields. The findings may contribute to a better understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of TESS detection: May 7, 2025</li>
    <li>Date of official discovery: Early July 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun during observation: Decreased from 6.35 AU to 5.47 AU</li>
    <li>Brightness increase: Approximately 5×</li>
    <li>Primary researchers: Adina Feinstein, Darryl Seligman, John Noonan</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 7, 2025, TESS captured data on comet 3I/ATLAS, marking the earliest known observation of the object. Researchers employed a technique called "shift-stacking" to amplify the faint signal of the comet in the crowded sky. By early June, the comet significantly brightened, attributed to vigorous outgassing of volatile compounds.</p>

<p>The formal discovery of 3I/ATLAS occurred in early July 2025, following the analysis of TESS's archival data. This precovery highlights the potential of revisiting existing datasets to uncover new astronomical findings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This precovery not only enriches the history of 3I/ATLAS but also showcases how revisiting archival data can yield hidden discoveries,” said researcher Adina Feinstein.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects. Previous encounters, such as the detection of 'Oumuamua in 2017, have prompted increased scrutiny of similar phenomena. The ability to detect and analyze these objects may lead to new insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue analyzing data from TESS and other telescopes to gather further insights into interstellar visitors. Ongoing studies may enhance understanding of the composition and behavior of such objects, contributing to the broader field of astronomy.</p>
