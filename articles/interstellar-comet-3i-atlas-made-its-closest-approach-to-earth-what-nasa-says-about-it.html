      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Made Its Closest Approach to Earth</h2>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 274 million kilometers. NASA has confirmed this event and released unique images of the comet, which originates from another star system.</p>

<p>This approach is significant because it marks the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring the comet's trajectory and providing updates on its characteristics and visibility.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 274 million kilometers (approximately 170 million miles)</li>
    <li>Speed at discovery: 221,000 kilometers per hour (137,000 miles per hour)</li>
    <li>Speed at perihelion: 246,000 kilometers per hour (153,000 miles per hour)</li>
    <li>Diameter of nucleus: between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Visibility: observable with a small telescope until spring 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2023 while it was approximately 670 million kilometers from the Sun, within Jupiter's orbit. It approached Earth from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. Observations indicated that it is on a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun and will exit the Solar System.</p>

<p>On October 31, 2025, astrometric observations of 3I/ATLAS resumed after it passed behind the Sun. The comet has since been visible in the pre-dawn sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19 – approximately 170 million miles (about 274 million km) away," the International Space Station's X account reported.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "Observations of 3I/ATLAS show that it is active, meaning it has an icy nucleus and a coma," NASA stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The first known interstellar object, ‘Oumuamua, was discovered in 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019. These discoveries have expanded our understanding of objects originating from outside our Solar System.</p>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS's journey through our Solar System provides opportunities for scientific observation and research into the characteristics of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun and eventually exits the Solar System. Observations will remain ongoing, and the comet is expected to be visible until spring 2026.</p>
