      <h2>Older Than The Sun? What Interstellar Wanderer 3I/ATLAS Is Revealing About Our Galaxy</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar object, designated 3I/ATLAS, has been identified as potentially older than the Sun and is providing insights into ancient astrophysical processes in the Milky Way. Astronomers believe this comet may predate the Sun by billions of years, making it the oldest comet ever analyzed by humans. The object has been observed entering and leaving our solar system, confirming its interstellar origin.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it allows scientists to study the formation of celestial bodies in the galaxy. Researchers from the University of Oxford have conducted statistical analyses estimating that 3I/ATLAS could be between 7.6 and 14 billion years old, which exceeds the Sun's age of approximately 4.6 billion years. Ongoing observations are being carried out to further understand its composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> Between 7.6 and 14 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Sun's Age:</strong> Approximately 4.6 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> 30 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observing Agencies:</strong> University of Oxford, NASA, James Webb Space Telescope</li>
    <li><strong>Key Composition Detected:</strong> Carbon dioxide (CO₂), water ice, and other gases</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is believed to have formed in the Milky Way's thick disk, a region populated by some of the galaxy's oldest stars. The object entered the solar system at high velocity, confirming it did not originate from within. It has been observed exhibiting outgassing events and complex tail structures as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>On 30 October 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun, during which telescopes in Tenerife captured its dynamic behavior, including periodic jet activity and unusual tail patterns. As the comet continues to move away from the Sun, ongoing observations are being conducted to gather more data about its composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The observations of the incoming trajectory and motion of 3I/ATLAS make it very likely to be the oldest comet we have ever seen,” said Chris Lintott, co-author from the University of Oxford.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The CO₂/H₂O ratio in the coma is among the highest measured in comets, indicating that 3I/ATLAS may have formed in a distant region of a protoplanetary disk,” said Matthew Hopkins, an astronomer involved in the age estimation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is a unique object that provides an opportunity to compare the physical processes shaping comets formed in different stellar environments. Previous studies of comets have primarily focused on objects originating from our solar system. The unusual properties of 3I/ATLAS have sparked discussions about the limits of natural cometary physics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing campaigns by space agencies and observatories will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it recedes into interstellar space. Researchers aim to gather additional data on its composition and behavior, enhancing our understanding of ancient celestial bodies in the Milky Way.</p>
