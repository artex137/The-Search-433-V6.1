      <h2>Radio Signal Confirms 3I/ATLAS Is Not an Alien Spaceship</h2>

<p>Scientists have confirmed that a radio signal from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, detected on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT radio telescope array in South Africa, refutes claims that the object is an alien spacecraft. The signal indicates the presence of water ice sublimating as the comet warms near the sun.</p>

<p>This finding matters as it clarifies the nature of 3I/ATLAS amidst ongoing public speculation about its origins. The detection of hydroxyl molecules (OH) suggests the comet is a natural icy body, actively outgassing, rather than a machine, according to researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detection date: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: MeerKAT radio telescope array, South Africa</li>
    <li>Molecular signature: Hydroxyl (OH) detected</li>
    <li>Size estimate: Up to 5.6 kilometers across</li>
    <li>Next observation: European Space Agency’s JUICE mission scheduled for February 2026</li>
    <li>Primary researcher: Michael Küppers, European Space Agency</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope array detected a radio signal from 3I/ATLAS. This signal revealed the presence of hydroxyl molecules, confirming the comet's active state. Prior to this, NASA’s Swift telescope had also identified hydroxyl in ultraviolet light.</p>

<p>Throughout the summer and fall of 2025, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb raised public interest by suggesting the possibility of an artificial origin for 3I/ATLAS, a claim that prompted significant media coverage and debate among astronomers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This observation confirms that one of the main components of the ices in the nucleus is water, the normal thing in a comet,” said Michael Küppers of the European Space Agency.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The hydroxyl tells us the comet contains water and that it is active,” stated planetary-atmospheres expert Javier Peralta.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Everything that has been observed fits what we see in other comets,” said David Jewitt of the University of California at Los Angeles.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The public debate over 3I/ATLAS has been fueled by claims of its potential artificial nature, particularly by Loeb, who suggested a 30% to 40% probability of an extraterrestrial origin. Critics have highlighted that unusual features in interstellar comets are expected due to their formation in different stellar environments.</p>

<p>Prior observations have noted traits of 3I/ATLAS that distinguish it from typical solar-system comets, including a visible coma extending farther from the sun and a higher ratio of carbon dioxide to water.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, with the European Space Agency’s JUICE mission set to conduct radio measurements during a flyby in February 2026. Further observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope are also planned.</p>
