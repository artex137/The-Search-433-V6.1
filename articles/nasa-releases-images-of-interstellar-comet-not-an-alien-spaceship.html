      <h2>NASA releases images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has released images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes Mars, confirming that it is not an alien spaceship. The images were shared on November 19, 2025, following a comprehensive observation campaign by space agencies worldwide.</p>

<p>This release matters because 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system, and scientists have conducted extensive studies to understand its characteristics. NASA has mobilized various spacecraft and telescopes to monitor the comet's trajectory and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by a telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet passed Mars at a distance of approximately 19 million miles.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, at about 170 million miles away.</li>
    <li>NASA's observations have involved eight different spacecraft and telescopes.</li>
    <li>The federal government shutdown from mid-September to November 12 delayed the release of some data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, during routine observations by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile. NASA scientists later reviewed data from other telescopes dating back to June 14, 2025. The comet has been continuously tracked since its discovery.</p>

<p>On October 15 to 26, NASA and the European Space Agency tracked the comet as it passed behind the sun. The agency's Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere mission collected data on the comet's tail from September 20 to October 3.</p>

<p>The latest images were released following the end of the federal government shutdown on November 12, which had temporarily halted data processing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Amit Kshatriya, NASA Associate Administrator:</strong> "This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet. But this one came from outside the solar system, which makes it fascinating, exciting and scientifically very important."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Avi Loeb, Baird Professor of Science at Harvard University:</strong> "NASA has delivered no big news and repeats the official mantra that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet... Related data from Mars rovers or orbiters... could reveal fragments from an iceberg that broke up or mini-probes released by a technological mothership."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins two other interstellar objects previously observed: 1I/'Oumuamua in 2018 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These objects have sparked significant interest and debate among scientists regarding their origins and characteristics, with some theorists suggesting they may not be purely natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December. Further observations may provide additional insights into the comet’s composition and behavior.</p>
