      <h2>Congresswoman Highlights UFO Transparency Issues at Hearing</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON‚ÄîCongresswoman Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), chairwoman of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, addressed a hearing on Tuesday focused on the need for transparency regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). The hearing, titled ‚ÄúRestoring Public Trust Through UFO/UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection,‚Äù emphasized concerns about national security and government accountability related to UAPs.</p>

<p>Task Force Chairwoman Luna has stated that the federal government and intelligence communities have not been transparent enough regarding UAP research and disclosure. She underscored the significance of addressing potential threats posed by UAPs to U.S. national security and the necessity for the government to acknowledge these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing date: Tuesday, not disclosed</li>
    <li>Location: Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Chairwoman: Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.)</li>
    <li>Key focus: Transparency in UAP investigations and protection for whistleblowers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During her opening remarks, Congresswoman Luna criticized the federal government for its lack of transparency regarding UAPs. She mentioned that numerous military whistleblowers have reported concerns about being silenced due to fear of repercussions for speaking out about UAP activity.</p>

<p>Luna also pointed out that Congress has attempted to create channels for reporting UAP incidents, including the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and the Intelligence Community Inspector General. However, she claimed that many reports have been dismissed or inadequately investigated.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>‚ÄúFor too long, the issue of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena has been shrouded in secrecy, stigma, and in some cases outright dismissal,‚Äù said Luna. ‚ÄúWe cannot protect our airspace if our best-trained observers are silenced.‚Äù</blockquote>

<blockquote>‚ÄúIf these objects are foreign in origin, they pose a direct threat to our national security,‚Äù Luna stated. ‚ÄúIf they represent something unknown, they demand rigorous scientific inquiry.‚Äù</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing follows a series of congressional discussions aimed at increasing transparency regarding UAPs. Luna and other representatives have raised concerns about previous reports from the AARO, which they claim have not adequately addressed the potential implications of UAPs.</p>

<p>Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Chris Mellon, criticized a recent AARO report for being ‚Äúthe most error-ridden and unsatisfactory government report‚Äù he has read, suggesting that it failed to meet the congressional mandate for thorough investigation.</p>

<h2>What‚Äôs next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue its inquiry into UAPs, focusing on enhancing transparency and protecting whistleblowers. The Task Force aims to ensure that the federal government is held accountable for its handling of UAP investigations and disclosures.</p>
