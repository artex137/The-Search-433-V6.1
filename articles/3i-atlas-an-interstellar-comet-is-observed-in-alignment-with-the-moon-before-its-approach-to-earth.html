      <h2>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, is observed in alignment with the Moon before its approach to Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS displayed a visual alignment with the Moon on December 11, 2025, as it approaches Earth. The comet is on a trajectory that will see it reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a safe distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers as it provides a unique opportunity to study materials from outside our solar system. The alignment has generated interest within the scientific community and among astronomy enthusiasts, prompting coordinated global observations to collect data as the comet approaches.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of alignment with the Moon: December 11, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 270 million kilometers (1.8 astronomical units)</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile</li>
    <li>Type: Third documented interstellar comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the Earth’s asteroid collision warning system, ATLAS, in mid-2025. The comet is characterized by its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its origins from a distant star system. On December 11, 2025, it appeared to pass behind the Moon, an event confirmed through detailed astronomical simulations.</p>
<p>As it approaches Earth, astronomers continue to monitor its activity, noting the comet’s diffuse coma and dusty tail, which are typical of cometary behavior. Observations from space telescopes such as Hubble and Gemini have provided crucial data on its composition and evolution.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Such alignments, although illusory in terms of physical interaction, are valuable for calibrating orbital models and for public engagement with astronomy,” said Professor Marcos Calil from Urânia Planetário.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified to cross our solar system. Previous interstellar visitors have provided insights into the composition and dynamics of materials formed in other stellar systems, expanding our understanding of cosmic environments and planetary formation processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will conduct extensive studies to gather data on its physical characteristics and trajectory. After its closest approach, the comet will continue its journey into the outer regions of the solar system before heading back into interstellar space.</p>
