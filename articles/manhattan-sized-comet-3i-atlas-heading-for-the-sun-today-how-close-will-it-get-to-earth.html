      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-30 17:45 UTC</p>

      <h2>Manhattan-sized comet 3I/ATLAS heading for the Sun today</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS, measuring the size of Manhattan, is set to reach its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. The comet will come within approximately 130 million miles of the Sun, just inside the orbit of Mars, according to Space.com. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>This event is significant because 3I/ATLAS has drawn attention due to its unusual characteristics and potential extraterrestrial origins. Authorities, including NASA, have stated that the comet does not pose any threat to Earth, as it will pass within 170 million miles of the planet. However, the object has sparked debate among scientists regarding its nature and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun will be about 130 million miles.</li>
    <li>It will pass within 170 million miles of Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by NASA's James Webb Telescope.</li>
    <li>NASA has not confirmed the existence of a photograph of the comet taken on October 2.</li>
    <li>European Space Agency's JUICE probe will have optimal observation capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by NASA's James Webb Telescope. The comet shifted to the opposite side of the Sun in September, becoming lost in solar glare. As of October 30, 2025, it will reach its closest point to the Sun.</p>

<p>During this time, astronomers and spacecraft, including those at Mars and NASA's Psyche mission, will attempt to observe the comet. However, terrestrial telescopes and devices in Earth’s orbit will not be able to capture images of the comet during its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS does not pose a threat to our planet,” NASA stated regarding the comet's trajectory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the comet’s unusual approach and trajectory, suggesting it could be a reconnaissance probe. “Its anomalous trajectory and non-gravitational acceleration suggest that ATLAS could be a potentially hostile alien probe,” he said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has galvanized interest in the study of comets, particularly those with unusual characteristics. The comet's behavior, including an anti-tail that points toward the Sun, has led to discussions about its origins and possible implications for Earth.</p>

<p>Previous comets have prompted similar discussions, but none have garnered as much scrutiny as 3I/ATLAS due to its size and trajectory. The debate surrounding its nature reflects ongoing interest in the potential for extraterrestrial life and the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists will continue to observe the comet using various spacecraft. NASA's position remains that the comet poses no threat, and further analysis is expected as data becomes available, particularly from the JUICE probe in February 2026.</p>
