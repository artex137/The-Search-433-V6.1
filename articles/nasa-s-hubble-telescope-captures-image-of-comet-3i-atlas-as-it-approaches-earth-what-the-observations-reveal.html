      <h2>NASA’s Hubble Telescope Captures Image of Comet 3I/ATLAS as it Approaches Earth</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently about 178 million miles from Earth, on November 30, 2023. This comet, first detected in July 2023, is significant as it is only the third known object to originate from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>NASA is monitoring 3I/ATLAS due to its unusual origins and trajectory. The comet is traveling at approximately 137,000 miles per hour (220,480 km/h) and will pass within a safe distance of 170 million miles from Earth on December 19, 2023. While it won’t be visible to the naked eye, it can be observed with a small telescope in the pre-dawn sky until spring 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is currently about 178 million miles (286 million kilometers) from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at approximately 137,000 miles per hour (220,480 km/h).</li>
    <li>It will pass within 170 million miles of Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet has a luminous coma and two distinct tails: one of charged gas and another of dust.</li>
    <li>Hubble's latest observation was on November 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>Data from the European Space Agency’s Juice mission will arrive in February 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2023, marking its entry into the solar system. Observations continued through November, with a significant image captured by Hubble on November 30. The comet approached the Sun, leading to increased activity and observations from the European Space Agency’s Juice mission, which recorded data between November 2 and 25. NASA released new photographs on November 19, revealing details about the comet's structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There are no aliens. There is no threat to life here on Earth,” said Sean Duffy, NASA’s acting administrator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We certainly haven’t seen any technosignatures or anything that would lead us to think it is anything other than a comet,” stated Nicola Fox, Associate Administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. Its detection has sparked public interest and speculation about extraterrestrial life, though NASA has dismissed such theories, emphasizing the comet's natural origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The comet will continue to be monitored as it approaches Earth, with new data expected from the European Space Agency's Juice mission in February 2024. Observers will have the opportunity to track its movement using NASA’s “Eyes on the Solar System” tool.</p>
