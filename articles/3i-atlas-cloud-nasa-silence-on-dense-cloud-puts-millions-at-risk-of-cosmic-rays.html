      <h2>3I/ATLAS Cloud: NASA Silence On Dense Cloud Puts Millions At Risk Of Cosmic Rays</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has raised significant concerns following NASA's press conference on 19 November, where officials reiterated that it is a 'natural comet' without providing new information about the mile-wide object. The lack of clarity comes as the solar system enters a dense galactic region, increasing the risk of cosmic rays affecting millions of air travellers.</p>

<p>Authorities are now facing pressure to explain the implications of this cosmic shift. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has expressed disappointment in NASA's handling of the situation, emphasizing that the agency has not addressed key anomalies surrounding 3I/ATLAS. The entry into the Local Interstellar Cloud is expected to alter the environment in ways that could have serious health implications for those flying at high altitudes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of NASA press conference: 19 November</li>
    <li>Size of 3I/ATLAS: approximately 1.6 kilometers in diameter</li>
    <li>Mass of 3I/ATLAS: a million times more than 'Oumuamua'</li>
    <li>Trajectory alignment: within 5 degrees of the ecliptic plane</li>
    <li>Cosmic rays are expected to increase due to the solar system's entry into a dense region of interstellar space</li>
    <li>Potential risk to air travellers: increased exposure to cosmic rays at altitudes of 30,000 to 40,000 feet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA held a press conference on 19 November to discuss 3I/ATLAS, but failed to provide significant new information. The agency reiterated that the object is a natural comet and attributed delays in updates to a government shutdown. Meanwhile, research has confirmed that the solar system is entering a dense Local Interstellar Cloud, which is affecting cosmic conditions.</p>
<p>As the solar system transitions into this new region, data from Voyager has indicated changes in heliospheric conditions, such as increased interstellar hydrogen and higher cosmic-ray penetration. This situation has raised alarms regarding the potential health risks for millions of air travellers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA should have emphasized what we do not understand rather than repeat familiar explanations,” said Avi Loeb following the press conference.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The entry into the Local Interstellar Cloud has been tracked through data from Voyager for years, indicating a significant shift in the solar system's cosmic environment. Increased cosmic-ray penetration poses risks to health, particularly for pilots and flight crews, as they are exposed to higher radiation levels at cruising altitudes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ground-based telescopes, along with the Hubble and Webb observatories, are expected to conduct measurements of 3I/ATLAS's jets to determine their composition and speed. This data may provide critical insights into the object's nature and the broader implications of the solar system's current cosmic environment.</p>
