      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Key Facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Current Location:</strong> Between Jupiter and Mars</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Visibility:</strong> Through September 2023, reappears December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 221,000 km/h (60,000 km/s)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Diameter:</strong> Approximately 1 km; up to 46 km according to some claims</li>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Estimated between 7.6 and 14 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) at Río Hurtado, Chile. Observations revealed that it was on an unusual trajectory, suggesting it originated from interstellar space.</p>
<p>In May 2023, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) captured images of 3I/ATLAS, which showed a significant increase in brightness, becoming five times brighter than previously observed. This anomaly raised questions about its composition and origin.</p>
<p>As of now, 3I/ATLAS is expected to come near Mars on October 3, and make its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official Statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is potentially the oldest comet ever seen by man,” said Matthew Hopkins, lead author of a July 2025 study. “If true, it predates the solar system itself.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The lack of iron in the plume of gas around 3I/ATLAS could indicate industrial production of nickel alloys,” stated Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, who has raised concerns about the object's possible artificial origins.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unusual characteristics have sparked extensive interest and debate among astronomers regarding its origins and nature, including speculation about the possibility of it being an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>What’s Next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and Mars. Further analysis is expected to provide more insights into its composition and trajectory, as well as its potential implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>
