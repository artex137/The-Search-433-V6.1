      <h2>'3I/ATLAS is a comet': NASA finally releases new 3I/ATLAS images and addresses alien rumors</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, confirming that it is a natural object and addressing speculation about its origins during a presentation on November 19. The space agency’s announcement comes after a period of silence attributed to the U.S. government shutdown from October 1 to November 12, which coincided with the comet's closest approach to the sun.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever recorded and could potentially be the oldest and most massive of its kind. NASA aims to clarify misconceptions surrounding the comet and to highlight its scientific importance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA released new images on November 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images as the comet passed Mars in early October.</li>
    <li>The comet is believed to be over 3 billion years older than our sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2023. It reached its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2023, entering an active phase. However, during this period, the U.S. government shutdown delayed NASA’s communication regarding the comet. On November 19, NASA officials released new images and confirmed the comet's identity as a natural object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This object is a comet,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya during the presentation. “It looks and behaves like a comet… and all evidence points to it being a comet. But this one came from outside the solar system, which makes it fascinating, exciting and scientifically very important.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    Tom Statler, lead scientist for solar system small bodies at NASA's Planetary Science Division, stated, “The likelihood is it came from a solar system older than our own solar system, which gives me goosebumps to think about frankly, because that means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system; it's a window into the deep past.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has generated significant public interest, partly due to speculation about its potential as an alien spacecraft. This speculation intensified during the government shutdown when NASA was unable to provide updates. The comet's natural origins have now been confirmed, emphasizing its importance for scientific research rather than conspiracy theories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the newly released images of comet 3I/ATLAS, with findings expected to enhance understanding of the comet's composition and origins. Further observations from various spacecraft will provide additional data in the coming months.</p>
