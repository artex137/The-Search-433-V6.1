      <h2>Viktor Hovland uses UFO interest to ease Ryder Cup pressure</h2>

<p>Norwegian golfer Viktor Hovland has turned to an unusual interest in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) to alleviate the pressures of competing in the Ryder Cup, which began on September 29, 2023, in Italy. Hovland's fascination with UFOs has provided him a mental escape from the frustrations of professional golf, he said on Thursday.</p>

<p>This approach matters as Hovland prepares for his third consecutive Ryder Cup appearance, aiming to improve his performance after mixed results in previous tournaments. His teammate Ludvig Aberg recently revealed Hovland's interest in the topic, prompting Hovland to share how this curiosity has helped him focus better on his game.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Ryder Cup 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Italy</li>
    <li>Hovland's world ranking: 12</li>
    <li>Previous Ryder Cup records: 0-3-2 in 2021; 3-1-1 in 2023</li>
    <li>Hovland's best range session: reported as his best in two years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 28, 2023, Hovland discussed his interest in UFOs, which has helped him cope with the pressures of competitive golf. He expressed that this fascination offers him a mental break and has led to valuable insights about himself. The day before, Aberg mentioned Hovland's interest in UFOs during a media interaction.</p>

<p>Hovland's performance at the Ryder Cup has improved since his first appearance in 2021, where he struggled. He reflected on his experiences from both tournaments, noting that previous participation has equipped him better for the current competition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I've always been extremely into my golf, and sometimes you just look at your golf swing and trying to practice hard and you don't really get the results that you want, it can be quite frustrating,” said Hovland. “I think it's been one of those things that I've kind of taken my mind off of golf a little bit.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“And then the more you go into it, you just get more questions,” he added. “It's one of those things that you don't really find any more answers but it's very interesting to go in there and kind of challenge some of your beliefs that you currently hold.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Hovland's previous Ryder Cup experiences have shaped his approach to the current tournament. In 2021, he faced challenges as a rookie on foreign soil, resulting in a winless record. However, his performance improved in 2023, reflecting personal growth and increased confidence.</p>

<p>Many athletes use various methods to manage pressure, and Hovland's unique interest in UFOs highlights the diverse strategies players adopt to maintain focus and mental well-being in high-stakes environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Hovland will compete in the Ryder Cup through October 1, 2023, aiming to continue his positive performance and contribute to the European team's success.</p>
