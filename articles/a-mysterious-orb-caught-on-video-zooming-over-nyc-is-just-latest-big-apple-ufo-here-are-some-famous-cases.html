      <h2>A mysterious orb caught on video zooming over NYC is just latest Big Apple ‘UFO’ — here are some famous cases</h2>

<p>A video showing a mysterious orb zooming over the Hudson River has emerged as the latest UFO incident in New York City. The video, aired earlier this week, captures the orb moving past the lower Manhattan skyline and has sparked interest in unidentified aerial phenomena in the area.</p>

<p>The sighting comes amid a rise in reported UFO incidents in New York, with over 20 cases documented in the past year. Authorities, including the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), are investigating these reports, highlighting a growing concern over unidentified flying objects in populated areas.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The orb was captured in a video aired earlier this week.</li>
    <li>The sighting occurred over the Hudson River, near lower Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Over 20 UFO reports have been made in New York in the past year.</li>
    <li>The AARO received 757 reports of UFO sightings from May 1, 2023, to June 1, 2023.</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 23, 1974, John Lennon reported a UFO sighting from his apartment overlooking the East River. He described the craft as silent, dark, and round, with blinking lights.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a local news station aired a four-second clip that incidentally captured a mysterious blue orb over the Hudson River. The orb was seen zooming past the camera during a report on congestion pricing.</p>

<p>In the past year, the AARO has received numerous reports of unidentified aerial phenomena, including a recent near miss involving a commercial aircraft and a cylindrical object off the coast of New York.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Imagine that: John Lennon reported seeing a UFO in New York on Aug. 23, 1974,” an article stated, referencing the famous musician's sighting.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This is most likely an optical artifact from the helicopter glass in front of the camera,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor, regarding the recent orb sighting.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There is someone in the room,” claimed Linda Napolitano during her hypnotic regression, recalling her alleged abduction experience in 1989.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
