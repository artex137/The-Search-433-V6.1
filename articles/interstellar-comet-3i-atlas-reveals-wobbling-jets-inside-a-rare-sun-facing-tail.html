      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Reveals Wobbling Jets Inside a Rare Sun-Facing Tail</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown unusual, wobbling jet structures within its sun-facing tail, according to recent observations made by astronomers. The findings emerged from a coordinated observing campaign conducted over 37 nights between July 2 and September 5, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it adds a new layer to the study of interstellar visitors and enhances understanding of how material formed around other stars behaves near the Sun. Researchers have linked the jets to the comet's rotation and its interaction with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted over 37 nights, from July 2 to September 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Two-meter Twin Telescope at the Teide Observatory was used for data collection.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus completes a full rotation every 15 hours and 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Wobbling jets within the sun-facing anti-tail were observed with a rhythm of approximately 7 hours and 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in 2025. A coordinated observing campaign began on July 2, 2025, and continued until September 5, 2025. During this period, astronomers tracked the comet's evolving coma as it approached the Sun.</p>
<p>Early images captured during this time revealed a fan-shaped dust structure oriented toward the Sun, which later transitioned into a more conventional tail as solar radiation pressure increased.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of structured, rotating jets in an interstellar comet provides valuable information about the physical properties of material formed in other planetary systems,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed object known to have entered the solar system from interstellar space, following the discoveries of ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each of these objects has exhibited different behaviors, challenging existing models of small-body formation.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS shows a mix of familiar and unexpected traits, particularly with the presence of wobbling jets in its anti-tail, which indicates active outgassing from a pristine body formed outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey outward toward the edge of the solar system, researchers plan to analyze the data collected to enhance understanding of interstellar objects. The comet is expected to leave the solar system permanently, but its observations will influence research in interstellar astronomy for years to come.</p>
