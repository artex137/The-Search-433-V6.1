      <h2>Avi Loeb highlights mystery of antywarkocz on comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is set to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers away. Recent observations have detected a rare structure, known as an antywarkocz, which is directed toward the Sun. This discovery has sparked discussions among astronomers regarding the comet's unusual composition and origin.</p>

<p>The comet, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, is being monitored by astronomers worldwide. Its hyperbolic trajectory and high speed of about 60 km/s confirm its interstellar origin. Authorities state that the comet poses no risk to Earth as it maintains a safe distance during its approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is expected to reach its minimum distance from Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at approximately 60 km/s.</li>
    <li>Its core diameter is estimated to be between 0.3 and 6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet passed perihelion on October 29, 2025, at about 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Recent images show the antywarkocz extending over 500,000 kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers identified the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet passed its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2025. As it continues its journey, it is now approaching Earth and will reach its minimum distance on December 19, 2025.</p>
<p>On December 13, 2025, images captured by telescopes in Thailand revealed the persistent antywarkocz aimed at the Sun. Ongoing observations have recorded this unusual feature since its initial sightings and have generated significant interest in its implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, an astronomer from Harvard, has commented on the unusual characteristics of the comet, stating, "The object exhibits a persistent antywarkocz that challenges conventional explanations."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit and high velocity indicate a trajectory originating from beyond the Solar System. Previous studies of interstellar comets have provided insights into the chemistry and formation of other star systems, making this discovery particularly significant.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor the comet as it approaches Earth, with ongoing studies aimed at understanding its unique features and behavior. Future observations, including those from the Hubble Space Telescope, will help clarify the nature of the antywarkocz and enhance knowledge about interstellar visitors to the Solar System.</p>
