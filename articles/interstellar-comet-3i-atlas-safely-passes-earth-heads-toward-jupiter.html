      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS safely passes Earth, heads toward Jupiter</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has passed Earth on December 19, 2025, as it moves through the solar system, according to NASA. The comet, which was discovered in July 2025, has been a subject of intrigue for scientists and the public alike.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it alleviates concerns regarding potential threats posed by the comet. NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a non-hazardous object, and it is now en route to a close approach to Jupiter, scheduled for March 16, 2026. The comet is expected to pass at a safe distance of approximately 33 million miles from the planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is moving toward Jupiter, with a close flyby planned for March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass approximately 33 million miles from Jupiter.</li>
    <li>It flew around 170 million miles away from Earth's orbit.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile in July 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a potentially hazardous object (PHO) based on its orbit.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass close to Neptune in 2028 and Pluto in April 2029.</li>
    <li>MAVEN, a Mars spacecraft, has been offline since December 4, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, the comet exhibited unusual behavior, leading to widespread speculation. It passed Earth safely on December 19, 2025, before heading towards Jupiter.</p>

<p>On March 16, 2026, the comet will make its closest approach to Jupiter. After passing Jupiter, it is expected to move close to Neptune in 2028 and Pluto in April 2029, before exiting the solar system in the mid-2030s.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "NASA has designated 3I/ATLAS as a potentially hazardous object, but it is not expected to collide with Jupiter," officials said. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is humanity's third-known interstellar visitor, following 1I Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I Borisov in 2019. The comet's journey has sparked interest and speculation about extraterrestrial life, which has now been quelled with its safe passage past Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter and beyond. Future observations will focus on understanding its trajectory and characteristics, particularly as it nears Neptune and Pluto. The status of the MAVEN spacecraft will also be assessed following its loss of contact since the comet's flyby near Mars.</p>
