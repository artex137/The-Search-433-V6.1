      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS makes closest Earth flyby on 19 December, astronomers track rare visitor</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on Friday, 19 December, passing approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 168 million miles, from the planet. The object, first detected on 1 July, has drawn attention from astronomers as it offers a rare opportunity to study an interstellar visitor traveling through the solar system.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the comet's unique origin from interstellar space, making it only the third confirmed interstellar object observed in the solar system. Authorities are utilizing various telescopes worldwide to track its trajectory and gather data before it departs on its long journey through the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest point: 1.8 astronomical units (168 million miles)</li>
    <li>Size estimate: between 440 meters and 3.47 miles wide</li>
    <li>First detected: 1 July 2023 by NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescopes in Chile</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/‘Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>Next significant approach: Closer pass by Jupiter in March 2024, approximately 33 million miles away</li>
    <li>Expected exit from solar system: Mid-2030s</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2023 by the ATLAS survey telescopes in Chile. Subsequent observations confirmed its interstellar origin. As it approaches Earth, astronomers have focused their efforts on tracking the comet's movement and gathering data using various space-based telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

<p>On 19 December 2023, 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth, providing astronomers with a critical opportunity to study its characteristics. Following this, it will pass near Jupiter in March 2024, before continuing its trajectory out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a rare object, and astronomers are keen to gather as much data as possible during its visit,” said Paul Chodas, director of NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS are significant because they originate from outside the solar system, unlike typical comets that form within it. The previous interstellar objects, 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the characteristics of such bodies, but 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity due to its size and trajectory.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun and Earth. They aim to collect extensive data before the comet becomes dimmer and more challenging to observe in the following weeks.</p>
