      <h2>Avi Loeb Slams 'Sluggish Bureaucracy' For 45-Day 3I/ATLAS Photo Delay</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has criticized NASA for a 45-day delay in releasing high-resolution photos of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Loeb made his remarks during an appearance on Newsmax on Thursday, highlighting concerns over the object’s classification as a comet by NASA’s acting Administrator Sean Duffy.</p>

<p>The delay in data release has raised questions within the scientific community. Loeb argues that unresolved anomalies surrounding 3I/ATLAS warrant further investigation, rather than acceptance of conventional explanations. He has called for the immediate release of the delayed photos to help clarify the object’s true nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object currently being studied.</li>
    <li>NASA has not released new images since October 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>The delay in imagery is attributed to 'manpower shortages' during a federal shutdown, according to NASA.</li>
    <li>Loeb has highlighted the presence of seven jets emanating from 3I/ATLAS, suggesting they could indicate more than just a typical comet.</li>
    <li>Loeb has called the bureaucratic processes at NASA 'sluggish,' impacting scientific progress.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2023, a High Resolution Imager (HiRISE) pass was conducted, which was expected to capture key high-resolution photos of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>Since that date, NASA has not released any new images, leading to criticism regarding the agency's response time and processes.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Dr. Avi Loeb expressed his concerns about the delay during an interview on Newsmax, arguing for the need for transparency in scientific data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It just shows you how sluggish this system of bureaucracy is,” Loeb stated. “I don’t necessarily think they’re trying to do something on purpose. It may be just bureaucracy taking over science.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It walks like a comet, talks like a comet, struts like a comet. It’s a comet,” said Duffy, defending the classification of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The foundation of science is the humility to learn, not the arrogance of expertise,” Loeb added, emphasizing the importance of evidence in scientific discourse.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate over 3I/ATLAS highlights ongoing tensions between traditional scientific authorities and emerging perspectives that demand evidence-based conclusions. Loeb's stance calls for a reevaluation of how scientific claims are validated.</p>
<p>This incident follows a trend in the scientific community where the rush to conclusions may overshadow thorough investigation and transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb hopes that new imagery of 3I/ATLAS will be released in the coming days, which may help scientists determine whether the object is a typical comet or something that defies conventional explanations.</p>
