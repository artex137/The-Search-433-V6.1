      <h2>Where is 3I/ATLAS now? When, how to see interstellar comet in December</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. This comet is the third confirmed object from outside our solar system. While it is not visible to the naked eye, observers can view it with a small telescope until spring 2026.</p>

<p>The upcoming approach of 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest among both professional and amateur astronomers. Authorities, including NASA, have provided resources and tools to help the public observe this unique event. They emphasize that while the comet has sparked various theories about its origins, it is not considered a threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
  <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 170 million miles</li>
  <li>Speed when discovered: about 137,000 mph</li>
  <li>Estimated size: 1,400 feet to 3.5 miles wide</li>
  <li>Last close approach to the sun: October 30, 2025, at about 130 million miles</li>
  <li>Visibility: observable with a small telescope until spring 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first confirmed in July 2025 as the third object discovered to originate from outside our solar system. It was detected traveling at a high speed, leading astronomers to conclude that it formed in another star system.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2025, the comet passed within 130 million miles of the sun. NASA has since released images and data from space telescopes that reveal more about the comet's features.</p>
<p>The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, allowing astronomers to observe it in the early morning sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  "No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth," said NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy in a social media exchange. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  "We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet," stated Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has contributed to ongoing discussions about interstellar objects and their implications for our understanding of the universe. Previous objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have also sparked speculation about extraterrestrial life and technology. However, the scientific consensus remains that these objects are natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and characteristics. Observations will be made until spring 2026, and NASA plans to share further updates and images from its ongoing observations.</p>
