      <h2>'That Shouldn't Exist' - New 3I/Atlas Observations Shock Social Media</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has sparked intense discussion on social media following reports of its unusual behaviour, particularly a precise alignment of its sun-facing jet. The object, which is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our Solar System, has drawn the attention of astronomers and conspiracy theorists alike since its perihelion on 29 October 2025.</p>

<p>This phenomenon matters because it challenges current understandings of cometary behaviour. Authorities, including NASA, are investigating the object’s characteristics, which appear inconsistent with typical comet activity. Scientists are calling for further observations to clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our Solar System.</li>
    <li>The object made its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The jet emitted by 3I/ATLAS has shown a narrow, steady alignment with the Sun, deviating by only eight degrees.</li>
    <li>The probability of such an alignment occurring naturally is estimated at 0.0025%.</li>
    <li>The object’s rotation period is approximately 16 hours.</li>
    <li>NASA reports that 3I/ATLAS exhibited a visible coma, dust tail, and green diatomic carbon emissions around perihelion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed as it approached the Solar System. Its perihelion occurred on 29 October 2025, during which astronomers noted the presence of a visible coma and dust tail, typical of active comets.</p>

<p>Following perihelion, researchers observed that the original jet source faded, but a new sun-facing jet appeared from the opposite side of the object, maintaining a precise alignment with the Sun.</p>

<p>This unusual behaviour has led scientists to investigate the mechanics behind the alignment, which remains stable despite expected changes from solar radiation and wind.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS is unusual, but it still displays overall cometary characteristics,” said an astronomer involved in tracking the object.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Further spectroscopic observations are definitely needed to understand this scientific puzzle,” noted a researcher discussing the object’s behaviour.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar visitors have also exhibited strange characteristics, but 3I/ATLAS's behaviour has garnered particular attention due to its precise alignment and stability. Researchers are considering the implications of these observations on our understanding of cometary physics and the formation of such objects beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its composition and behaviour. The ongoing investigation aims to clarify whether its unusual characteristics can be explained within the framework of known physics.</p>
