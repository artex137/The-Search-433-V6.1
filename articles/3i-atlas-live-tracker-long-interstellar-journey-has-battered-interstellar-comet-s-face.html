      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: Long interstellar journey has battered interstellar comet's face</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has been travelling for billions of years, has shown signs of significant alteration due to its long journey through space. Observations indicate that galactic cosmic rays have transformed its outer layers, according to scientists. The comet was first detected on July 1 and is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it provides insight into the effects of cosmic radiation on interstellar objects. NASA and other space agencies continue to study 3I/ATLAS to understand its composition and behaviour as it approaches our planet. Astronomers are preparing for a closer examination when it reaches its proximity to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is between 7 and 14 billion years old.</li>
    <li>First seen on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>It has previously come near Mars, the Sun, and Jupiter.</li>
    <li>Evidence suggests the comet’s surface has been altered by galactic cosmic rays.</li>
    <li>James Webb Space Telescope images indicate high levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) on its surface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been travelling through the galaxy for billions of years, predating our solar system. It was first observed by scientists on July 1, 2023. Over its long journey, the comet has been subjected to intense galactic cosmic rays, which have significantly altered its structure.</p>
<p>As it approached the Sun, there were indications of a potential explosion, although this has not been confirmed. The comet is set to come close to Earth on December 19, 2023, providing a unique opportunity for astronomers to study it further.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The evidence shows that Gyr-scale galactic cosmic rays have altered the outer layers of the nucleus of the interstellar comet,” said a scientist involved in the study.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While some speculate about its origins, NASA maintains that it is a comet, albeit a unique one,” a NASA spokesperson stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its journey and the alterations it has undergone due to cosmic radiation provide valuable data for understanding the nature of interstellar objects and their interactions with other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will conduct detailed observations to study its composition and behaviour. Further research will focus on understanding the implications of its altered state and the effects of cosmic radiation on similar objects.</p>
