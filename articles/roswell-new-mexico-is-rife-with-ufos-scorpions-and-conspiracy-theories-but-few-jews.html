      <h2>Roswell, New Mexico, Remains a Hub for UFO Lore and Conspiracy Theories</h2>

<p>Roswell, New Mexico, has continued to capture public interest with its deep connections to UFO lore and conspiracy theories, dating back to the 1947 incident involving mysterious debris found on a local ranch. The town, home to about 47,000 residents, is known for its UFO-themed attractions but has seen a significant decline in its Jewish population, with the last synagogue relocating to Albuquerque five years ago.</p>

<p>This phenomenon matters because the Roswell incident has shaped the town's identity and contributed to its tourism industry. Despite the lack of evidence supporting alien contact, the narrative persists, attracting visitors and fueling local businesses. Authorities and residents have acknowledged the lasting impact of this event on the community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Roswell, New Mexico</li>
    <li>Population: Approximately 47,000</li>
    <li>Original date of Roswell incident: July 1947</li>
    <li>Closure of Congregation B’nai Israel: five years ago</li>
    <li>Annual Roswell UFO Festival: attracts thousands of visitors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 1947, rancher W.W. “Mac” Brazen discovered unusual debris on his property and reported it to local Sheriff George Wilcox. The Roswell Army Air Field announced on July 9 that it had recovered a “flying disc.” This claim was quickly retracted, with military officials stating the debris was from a weather balloon.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, Stanton T. Friedman revisited the incident, advocating for the existence of extraterrestrial life. His work led to renewed public interest and conspiracy theories surrounding the event. In 1997, the U.S. Air Force released a report claiming the recovered materials were part of Project Mogul, a balloon program designed to monitor Soviet nuclear tests.</p>

<p>Most recently, in 2020, President Donald Trump acknowledged Roswell’s significance in a campaign video, highlighting the ongoing fascination with the incident.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No, I doubt it. This has become a religion to many people. It’s almost a cult.”</blockquote>
<p>- Retired Air Force Col. Richard Weaver, on the persistence of UFO beliefs.</p>

<blockquote>“It is reasonable to imagine the absence of antisemitism in interstellar space.”</blockquote>
<p>- Avi Loeb, Israeli-American physicist, discussing the appeal of space exploration.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Roswell incident has prompted numerous books, documentaries, and conspiracy theories over the decades. The town's identity has become intertwined with this event, despite the absence of credible evidence for alien life. The local Jewish community has dwindled, with the last synagogue closing due to a lack of support, leaving the town largely devoid of Jewish life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UFOs continues, the Pentagon has established an All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office to investigate unidentified aerial phenomena. The annual Roswell UFO Festival will likely continue to draw tourists, further embedding the town's reputation as a center for UFO culture.</p>
