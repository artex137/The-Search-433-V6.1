      <h2>Roswell, New Mexico, UFO Culture and Jewish Community Shrinkage</h2>

<p>Roswell, New Mexico, is known for its UFO culture and conspiracy theories, but it has seen a significant decline in its Jewish population. The only synagogue in the area, Congregation B’Nai Israel, closed and relocated to Albuquerque five years ago, according to former member Leslie Lawner.</p>

<p>This development highlights the paradox of Roswell, a town defined by its famous 1947 UFO incident, yet home to virtually no Jews. Authorities and community members are now reflecting on the cultural impact this has had on the small Jewish community that once existed there.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Population of Roswell: approximately 47,000</li>
    <li>Closure of Congregation B’Nai Israel: five years ago</li>
    <li>Last services held: twice a month on Fridays</li>
    <li>Location of the original synagogue: 8th and Washington, Roswell</li>
    <li>Distance from Roswell to Albuquerque: approximately three hours by car</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, local rancher W.W. "Mac" Brazen discovered unusual debris on his property. He reported this to Sheriff George Wilcox, who then informed the Roswell Army Air Field. On July 9, 1947, the airfield announced the recovery of a “flying disc,” a claim later retracted as a misidentification of a weather balloon.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, Stanton T. Friedman revisited the incident, turning it into a lifelong pursuit to prove the existence of UFOs. His work has inspired numerous books and documentaries about the Roswell incident. The town has since embraced its alien-themed identity, featuring UFO replicas and merchandise.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There was really nothing we could do for them,” said Leslie Lawner, referring to the closure of the synagogue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This has become a religion to many people. It’s almost a cult,” said retired Air Force Col. Richard Weaver regarding the enduring fascination with the Roswell incident.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Roswell incident has long been a focal point for UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists. Despite numerous government reports, including a 1997 Air Force document that classified the debris as part of a top-secret project, the town's identity remains tied to alien lore. The closure of Congregation B’Nai Israel reflects a broader trend of declining Jewish presence in regions with small populations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>With the Jewish community in Roswell virtually non-existent, the focus may shift to preserving the historical significance of the area's past while exploring the cultural implications of its UFO legacy. No further developments regarding the Jewish community have been disclosed. </p>
