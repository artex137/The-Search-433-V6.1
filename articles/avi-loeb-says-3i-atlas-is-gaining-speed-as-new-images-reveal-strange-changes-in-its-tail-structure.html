      <h2>Avi Loeb says 3I/Atlas is gaining speed as new images reveal strange changes in its tail structure</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb has reported that comet 3I/Atlas is gaining speed and has displayed notable changes in its tail structure following its perihelion on October 30, 2025. New images from the Virtual Telescope Project show a brighter coma and a longer ion tail, among other features, since the comet has emerged from solar conjunction.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it has prompted discussions among astronomers about the comet's behavior and its potential implications. NASA has indicated that 3I/Atlas is on a hyperbolic trajectory, and observations are ongoing to better understand the phenomena associated with its speed and tail morphology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas reached perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet accelerated from approximately <strong>137,000 mph</strong> to around <strong>153,000 mph</strong> at perihelion.</li>
    <li>New images show a brighter coma and a longer ion tail.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has suggested the presence of structured jets and a sunward anti-tail.</li>
    <li>The International Asteroid Warning Network is monitoring 3I/Atlas from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet poses no impact risk as it follows an unbound flyby trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Hubble's imaging indicated that 3I/Atlas was shedding dust from its sunward side. This early observation suggested active behavior as it approached perihelion. On October 30, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, accelerating significantly as it passed closest to the Sun. Following this, the comet displayed a brightening and changes in tail structure, which were documented in new images from November 2025.</p>
<p>From August to mid-November 2025, the comet transitioned from a compact, reddish dust-dominated coma to a brighter coma featuring a lengthening ion tail. Observations during this period have contributed to ongoing discussions about the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated in a Medium post dated November 14, 2025, “Technological thrusters which point their exhaust towards the Sun would accelerate away from the Sun.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb further remarked, “The series of collimated jets in post-perihelion images of 3I/ATLAS extend out to a million kilometers towards the Sun and 3 million kilometers away from the Sun.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA’s current FAQ indicates that the speed of 3I/Atlas is rising into perihelion then declining, consistent with the expected arc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Qicheng Zhang clarified, “We don’t have any evidence for the gas coma changing colors,...Our result just showed that the gas coma is likely still around and contributing substantially to the overall brightness.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous observations of comets similar to 3I/Atlas have shown that they typically accelerate toward the Sun due to gravitational forces before slowing down on their way out. The consensus among astronomers currently supports the idea that 3I/Atlas is behaving as an active comet, influenced by solar heating and the solar wind. The ongoing monitoring efforts by NASA and the International Asteroid Warning Network aim to enhance understanding of the comet's behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/Atlas will continue through January 27, 2026, with periodic check-ins scheduled through early February. Astronomers will gather more data to refine their models and understand the comet’s behavior and potential non-gravitational effects.</p>
