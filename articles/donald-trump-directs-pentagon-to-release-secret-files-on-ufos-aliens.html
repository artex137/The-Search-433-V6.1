      <h2>Donald Trump directs Pentagon to release secret files on UFOs, aliens</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to release long-secret government files related to UFOs and possible extraterrestrial life on February 19, 2026. The announcement was made via his Truth Social platform and indicates a potential shift towards transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).</p>

<p>This decision follows Trump's criticism of former President Obama’s remarks on extraterrestrial life and reflects growing interest in the topic. The President has instructed the Department of Defense and other federal agencies to identify and release documents related to unexplained sightings and alleged alien encounters.</p>
