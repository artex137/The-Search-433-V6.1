      <h2>Harvard's Avi Loeb Suggests Possible 'Artificial Connection' Between C/2025 V1 and 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has proposed a controversial theory suggesting a potential artificial connection between the newly discovered comet <strong>C/2025 V1</strong> and the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>. His claims were published in an essay on Medium, where he speculated this connection could involve non-gravitational propulsion, indicating an intelligent origin.</p>

<p>This theory has sparked interest and skepticism within the scientific community. Authorities and researchers are now closely monitoring both objects to assess their trajectories and behavior in the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Dates:</strong> 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (about 270 million kilometres).</li>
    <li><strong>Orbital Separation:</strong> The closest separation between the two objects is 75 million kilometres (0.5 AU).</li>
    <li><strong>Orbital Characteristics:</strong> C/2025 V1 is described as 'nearly interstellar' due to its extreme orbital eccentricity and inclination.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope in Hawaii first detected 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system. Following this, Avi Loeb published his essay on Medium, proposing a potential connection between 3I/ATLAS and C/2025 V1. In this essay, he noted that C/2025 V1 is not related to 3I/ATLAS without non-gravitational propulsion. Currently, astronomers continue to track both objects as 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "One of the fundamental unknowns regarding 3I/ATLAS is whether it represents a technological mothership that released mini-probes into the inner solar system."</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA's Tom Statler dismissed Loeb's claims, saying, "It looks like a comet. It does comet things."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's theory about 3I/ATLAS adds to ongoing discussions about the origins of interstellar objects. Many scientists remain skeptical of claims suggesting technological origins for such celestial bodies. Previous observations of 3I/ATLAS have shown it behaving like a natural comet, with ultraviolet observations detecting hydroxyl emissions typical of water-driven outgassing.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor the trajectories and behaviors of C/2025 V1 and 3I/ATLAS. Observations will focus on any propulsion-like effects as 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, while researchers will explore the uncertain origins of C/2025 V1.</p>
