      <h2>Hera And Europa Clipper Will Pass Through 3I/ATLAS' Tail</h2>

<p>NASA's Hera and Europa Clipper spacecraft will pass through the tail of comet 3I/ATLAS within the next two weeks. Hera is scheduled to have a window from October 25 to November 1, while Europa Clipper will follow from October 30 to November 6. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This opportunity to study the comet's tail is significant for scientists, as it offers a chance to collect data on ions produced by the comet as it approaches the Sun. The spacecraft are not equipped for this specific mission, but researchers are exploring options to utilize them for the unexpected experiment.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object discovered.</li>
    <li>Hera is en route to Didymos-Dimorphos, while Europa Clipper is on its way to study Europa.</li>
    <li>Hera will pass through the comet's tail between October 25 and November 1.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper will pass through the tail from October 30 to November 6.</li>
    <li>The tail has been growing since the comet's discovery in June.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach perihelion on October 29.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early June, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered, and since then, its tail has been growing, releasing water particles and ions. On October 29, the comet is expected to reach perihelion, marking its closest approach to the Sun. Hera and Europa Clipper, both on separate missions, will pass through the tail during their scheduled windows in late October and early November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Sometimes science means doing the best with what you have, and in this case, these two spacecraft are our best bet to study the tail of an interstellar comet.” - Samuel Grand, Finnish Meteorological Institute</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s unclear whether the mission controllers for Hera or Europa Clipper will see the message in time to do anything about their potential journey through the coma.” - Geraint Jones, ESA</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object identified by astronomers, following Oumuamua and Borisov. The study of such objects can provide insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems. Previous attempts to study interstellar comets have been limited by their distance and the technology available at the time.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and assess the feasibility of collecting data from the spacecraft as they pass through its tail. The mission teams for Hera and Europa Clipper will determine if adjustments can be made to enable data collection during the flybys.</p>
