      <h2>John Williams to Score Steven Spielberg’s Untitled UFO Thriller — Set for Release Next Summer</h2>

<p>John Williams, 93, will score Steven Spielberg’s upcoming untitled UFO film, confirmed Damian Woetzel, president of Juilliard. The film is set for release in June 2024. Williams is currently in Los Angeles collaborating with Spielberg in the studio.</p>

<p>This collaboration is significant as it marks the 30th partnership between Williams and Spielberg. Their first film together, “The Sugarland Express,” was released five decades ago. Williams, who had announced his retirement from film composing in January 2023, has returned to work on this project, which has generated excitement among fans and industry insiders.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In January 2023, John Williams announced his retirement from film composing, stating that “The Fabelmans” and “Indiana Jones 5” would be his final films. However, he has returned to work with Spielberg on the UFO film, which quietly wrapped production in June 2023.</p>
<p>Williams and Spielberg have a long history of collaboration, dating back to their first joint project, “The Sugarland Express,” released 50 years ago. This new film will be their 30th partnership.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Yes, it is like a sci-fi... Well, I don’t know. I’m not supposed to say [...] It does harken back to maybe a different tone than [what he’s done lately]. Something he used to do that he hasn’t done for a little bit,” said Josh O’Connor, a cast member, hinting at the film's nostalgic elements.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>John Williams holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for scoring, with 52 nominations, including 17 for Spielberg films such as “Jaws,” “E.T.,” and “Schindler’s List.” Spielberg’s last film, “The Fabelmans,” received positive reviews and won a Toronto audience award, following the success of “West Side Story,” which earned seven Oscar nominations in 2021.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the film approaches its release date, further promotional activities and trailers are expected to be unveiled. Audiences are eager for more details about the film's plot and themes, especially given its connection to Spielberg's earlier works.
