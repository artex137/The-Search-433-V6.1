      <h2>3I/ATLAS Sending Mysterious Fibonacci-Pattern Pulse Signal at 1420 MHz</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has emitted a mysterious pulse signal detected at a frequency of 1420 MHz, according to researchers. The signal, following a Fibonacci pattern, has drawn global attention as scientists investigate its potential implications for extraterrestrial communication.</p>

<p>This discovery has reignited interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. Authorities are currently analyzing the signal's stability and precision, which some experts suggest could indicate an intelligent source. The findings have sparked discussions in the scientific community about the nature of interstellar communication.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Signal Frequency: 1420 MHz</li>
    <li>Pulse Sequence: 8 • 13 • 8 • 5 • 13 • 8</li>
    <li>Detection Distance: 15,000 kilometres</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: 29 October 2025, at 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 167 million miles)</li>
    <li>Initial Detection: July 2025, using the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025, marking its entry into the Solar System. On 29 October 2025, it made its closest approach to Earth, allowing astronomers to study it in detail. The mysterious pulse signal was detected shortly thereafter, leading to heightened interest and investigation.</p>

<p>On October 13, 2025, filmmaker and researcher David Sereda reported unusual light emissions from 3I/ATLAS, which he claimed followed a Fibonacci rhythm. This event coincided with the 108th anniversary of the Miracle of the Sun at Fátima, Portugal.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The pulses appear to be deliberate and intelligent, as they remain unaffected by the object’s rotation, which is unusual for natural cosmic sources,” said researchers involved in the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Fibonacci sequence is a significant mathematical pattern found in various natural phenomena, including DNA, galaxies, and plant growth. The appearance of a Fibonacci-like signal has led to speculation about its source, prompting scientists to investigate further.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is recognized as a one-time visitor from beyond the Solar System, traveling on a hyperbolic orbit. Its interstellar origin has been confirmed by major observatories, making it a subject of intense scientific interest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are working to verify the authenticity of the pulse signal and determine whether it is a genuine transmission or the result of natural or instrumental interference. Further observations are expected once 3I/ATLAS becomes visible from the Northern Hemisphere in December 2025.</p>
