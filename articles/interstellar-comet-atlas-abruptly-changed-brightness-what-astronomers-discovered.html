      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS abruptly changes brightness</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited a significant increase in brightness as it approaches the Sun, according to observations reported by Science Alert. The comet, currently nearly behind the Sun, has been monitored using space technology since mid-September and is expected to be visible from Earth in November and December.</p>

<p>This rapid change in brightness is noteworthy for astronomers as it may indicate unusual processes on the comet's surface. The observations have been conducted by astronomers Kicheng Zhang from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona and Carl Battams from the US Naval Research Laboratory, using data from the STEREO-A, SOHO, and GOES-19 missions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has shown a brightness increase twice as fast as many other comets.</li>
    <li>Distance to the Sun reduced from 2 to 1.36 astronomical units between mid-September and late October.</li>
    <li>Perihelion was reached on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet will be observable from Earth in November and December.</li>
    <li>Significant changes in color from reddish to a bluer hue, indicating active gas emissions.</li>
    <li>Caves similar to those on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko have been discovered on 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In mid-September 2023, observations indicated that comet 3I/ATLAS was nearing the Sun. By the end of October, as the comet approached perihelion on October 29, its brightness increased significantly, raising questions about its surface processes. The comet is now transitioning back into the night sky, making it visible to amateur astronomers in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The rapid change in brightness may be related to the comet's chemical composition or its movement characteristics through interstellar space,” said Kicheng Zhang.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn attention not only for its brightness but also for its unusual behavior. Previous studies of comets have shown that such changes can provide critical insights into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. Observations of this comet may lead to new scientific theories and approaches in space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS to further investigate the reasons behind its rapid brightness change and to uncover more about its physical characteristics and behavior as it travels through the Solar System.</p>
