      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet Live Tracker: Will 3I/ATLAS reappear again? Here's what happens to the comet next</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest pass by the Sun on October 30, 2025, coming within 1.36 astronomical units of the Sun, according to scientists. This interstellar object is only the third known to enter our solar system and is currently not visible from Earth as it is behind the Sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is expected to undergo major changes during its approach to the Sun. Astronomers are monitoring the comet closely, anticipating its reappearance around November 11 in the eastern predawn sky.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>It passed within 1.36 AU of the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet will reappear around November 11, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observers will need a telescope of at least 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter to see it.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS remains invisible to ground-based observers until early November due to the Sun's glare.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. This marked its perihelion, the point at which it is closest to the Sun.</p>
<p>Following this, the comet is expected to reappear in the eastern sky around November 11, 2025, although it will remain faint and require a large telescope for observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a faint but fascinating visitor for astronomers,” said a spokesperson from the observatory monitoring the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system. Its behavior and characteristics are of great interest to scientists studying the composition and dynamics of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches its reappearance, astronomers will continue to observe its changes and track its trajectory, ensuring that skywatchers are informed about the best times and methods to view 3I/ATLAS.</p>
