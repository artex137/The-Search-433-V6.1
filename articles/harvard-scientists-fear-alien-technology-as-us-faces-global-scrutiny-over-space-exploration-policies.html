      <h2>Harvard Scientists Fear Alien Technology as US Faces Global Scrutiny Over Space Exploration Policies</h2>

<p>A recent discovery of an interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has sparked renewed debate about extraterrestrial life. First observed in July 2025, this comet is only the third of its kind identified, and it is currently passing through our solar system. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has significant implications for the scientific community. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet might not be a natural phenomenon but could potentially be an artifact of alien technology. Authorities, including NASA, are considering using the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) for closer observation as the comet approaches Mars in October 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is only the third known interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has proposed that the comet may be an artifact of alien technology.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to approach Mars in October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter may be used to gather data on the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers first observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Since its discovery, discussions have emerged regarding its possible nature, particularly due to claims made by Avi Loeb. As the comet approaches Mars, scheduled for October 2025, NASA has been prompted to consider utilizing the MRO for detailed observation.</p>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “I encouraged the HiRISE team to use their camera during the first week of October 2025 in order to gather new data on 3I/ATLAS. They responded favorably.”</blockquote>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb remarked, “3I/ATLAS could be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy, and the dust emitted from its frontal surface might be from dirt that accumulated on its surface during its interstellar travel.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery follows Loeb's previous controversial claims regarding other interstellar objects, including 1I/ʻOumuamua, which he suggested may have been an alien probe. His theories often attract skepticism but stimulate important discussions about the potential for life beyond Earth. The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS has highlighted the need for more data and rigorous investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As scientists prepare to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS, the upcoming close approach to Mars presents a critical opportunity for observation. The scientific community remains cautious but eager to explore the implications of Loeb's theories regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>
