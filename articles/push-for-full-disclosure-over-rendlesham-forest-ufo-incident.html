      <h2>Push for full disclosure over Rendlesham Forest UFO incident</h2>

<p>A filmmaker has renewed calls for the British government to release the remaining classified UFO files related to the 1980 sighting in Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk. Mark Christopher Lee, who has extensively researched the incident, is urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to order full disclosure, particularly in light of recent moves in the United States to declassify material on unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>This push for transparency is significant as the Rendlesham Forest incident is regarded as one of the most debated UFO sightings in British history. Lee believes that the release of documents could provide clarity on the events that took place during the Christmas weekend of December 1980, when servicemen at nearby US airbases reported seeing strange lights in the forest.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred over the Christmas weekend of December 1980.</li>
    <li>Location: Rendlesham Forest, near RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters.</li>
    <li>Witnesses included trained military personnel from the United States Air Force.</li>
    <li>Charles Halt, then deputy base commander, documented unexplained aerial activity.</li>
    <li>Mark Christopher Lee has produced a documentary titled "The Rendlesham UFO – The British Roswell."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 1980, during the Christmas weekend, multiple servicemen stationed at RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters reported seeing unusual lights in Rendlesham Forest. The incident became notable when a memo from Charles Halt detailed unexplained aerial activity and physical traces at the landing site.</p>

<p>In recent years, Mark Christopher Lee has revisited the case through his documentary, which examines witness testimonies and the possibility of further classified evidence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“With the US leading the way, the rest of the world must now follow. Countries like France, Brazil, and others have already declassified files – the UK cannot lag behind,” said Mark Christopher Lee. “This is the moment to kick-start full transparency here and give witnesses a safe platform.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lee added, “I regularly receive reports from pilots, military personnel, and members of the public who have witnessed or experienced UFO phenomena, but they refuse to go public due to fear of ridicule.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Rendlesham Forest incident has drawn significant attention over the years, with supporters citing the credibility of military witnesses and the existence of official documentation as key factors that distinguish it from other reported sightings. The ongoing debate reflects broader global trends in UFO disclosure, as several countries have moved to declassify their files on unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee is calling for parliamentary hearings and a formal review of all remaining UK UFO files. The outcome of these efforts may influence future government actions regarding transparency in UFO-related matters.</p>
