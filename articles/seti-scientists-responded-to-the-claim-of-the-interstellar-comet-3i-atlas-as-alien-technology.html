      <h2>SETI Scientists Respond to Claim of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS as Alien Technology</h2>

<p>Scientists at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute have responded to claims that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could be alien technology. The comet, discovered in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), has sparked debate among researchers regarding its nature and implications for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention due to a paper co-authored by Harvard astrophysicist Abraham Loeb, suggesting that 3I/ATLAS might be an alien probe. In contrast, SETI scientist A.K.M. Eahsanul Haque has published a new paper challenging that perspective, arguing that the comet's characteristics do not indicate extraterrestrial origins. The discussion reflects broader concerns about how humanity might respond to potential extraterrestrial threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025 by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Co-authored paper by Avi Loeb proposes it could be an alien probe.</li>
    <li>SETI scientist A.K.M. Eahsanul Haque has published a counter-argument.</li>
    <li>Comet will become invisible from Earth until late November/early December 2025.</li>
    <li>Claims of extraterrestrial technology based on comet's orbital characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed by the ATLAS telescope in July 2025. Following its discovery, a paper authored by Loeb and colleagues suggested it might be an alien probe. In response, SETI scientist Haque published a paper disputing these claims, asserting that the comet's peculiarities are typical of interstellar comets. The debate continues as astronomers await the comet's return visibility late in 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The galactic disk, which is where most stars are, is nearly in line with the solar system's ecliptic plane," Haque stated, emphasizing that the unusual trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is expected for interstellar comets.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Loeb described his theory as a "pedagogical exercise" and emphasized the need for preparedness regarding planetary defenses, regardless of its validity.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS is not isolated; it reflects ongoing debates in the scientific community regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life and the implications of discovering such evidence. The "Dark Forest" hypothesis, referenced in relation to the comet, suggests that advanced civilizations might eliminate others to protect themselves, adding urgency to the discourse on planetary defense.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As astronomers prepare for the comet's return visibility in late November or early December 2025, further studies and discussions are expected. Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and assess its trajectory and characteristics to better understand its origins.</p>
