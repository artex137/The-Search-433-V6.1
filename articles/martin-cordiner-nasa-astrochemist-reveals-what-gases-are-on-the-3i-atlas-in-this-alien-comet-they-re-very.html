      <h2>Martin Cordiner, NASA astrochemist, reveals what gases are on the 3I/ATLAS: “In this alien comet they’re very abundant”</h2>

<p>NASA astrochemist Martin Cordiner has announced findings regarding the alien comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on 1 July and is currently moving through our solar system. The comet is significant as it is the third known object from outside our solar system to visit, and its unique chemical composition has captured the attention of scientists and the public alike.</p>

<p>The research conducted by Cordiner and his team at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, utilizing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, has revealed that 3I/ATLAS is rich in carbon-based molecules, particularly methanol and hydrogen cyanide. These compounds are essential to the formation of life, and their abundance in 3I/ATLAS differs markedly from that found in comets originating from our own solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving out of the inner solar system and will be closest to Earth on 19 December 2023.</li>
    <li>At its closest approach, 3I/ATLAS will be approximately 170 million miles (1.8 astronomical units) from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet sheds between 0.25 to 0.5 kilograms of hydrogen cyanide and around 40 kilograms of methanol per second.</li>
    <li>Hydrogen cyanide and methanol comprise approximately 2% and 8% of the total gas vapor emitted by the comet, respectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2023. Since its discovery, astronomers have monitored its trajectory and chemical emissions. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun in late October 2023 and is now on a path that will bring it close to Earth in December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Molecules like hydrogen cyanide and methanol are at trace abundances and not the dominant constituents of our own comets,” said Cordiner. “Here we see that, actually, in this alien comet they’re very abundant,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS contributes to a growing understanding of the composition of comets from outside our solar system. Previous studies have indicated that comets originating from our solar system exhibit different chemical properties. The findings from 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the origins of these celestial bodies and their potential role in the development of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Researchers will analyze the data collected from the comet to further understand its composition and origins.</p>
