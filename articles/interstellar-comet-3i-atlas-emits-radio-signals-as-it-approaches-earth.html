      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS emits radio signals as it approaches Earth</h2>

<p>Terrestrial observatories have recorded radio emissions from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Hawaii. The comet, the first confirmed object of its kind from outside the Solar System, is approaching the Sun and will reach perihelion in December 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as NASA and the UN have classified 3I/ATLAS as a potentially dangerous object due to its trajectory, which crosses Earth's orbital plane. Authorities are closely monitoring the comet's path and emissions, which experts attribute to the interaction of released gases with the solar wind. There is currently no evidence to suggest the emissions are of artificial origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed exceeding 60 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Its minimum distance from Earth is expected in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Nasa and the UN have classified it as a potentially dangerous object.</li>
    <li>Radio emissions were detected by MeerKAT in South Africa and confirmed by global networks.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be tens of kilometers long.</li>
    <li>NASA has activated planetary defense protocols for continuous monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS system in Hawaii discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Observations began shortly after, with the Hubble Space Telescope capturing detailed images when the comet was approximately 445 million kilometers from Earth. By November 2025, MeerKAT in South Africa detected radio emissions, which were confirmed by a global network of radio telescopes.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches the Sun, its activity has increased, leading to the release of gases that interact with solar particles. NASA and international agencies have implemented monitoring protocols to track its trajectory, ensuring that updates are provided daily.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The radio emissions have a pattern compatible with natural sublimation processes,” said a NASA scientist. “We have ruled out any artificial signal after a complete spectral analysis.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been traveling through interstellar space for billions of years, suggesting a formation in a cold environment similar to the Oort cloud. The detection of volatiles such as water, carbon monoxide, and methane indicates its potential for generating a visible coma as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>This phenomenon of increased activity is common among comets as they draw closer to solar heat, which accelerates the sublimation of frozen compounds.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Agencies are preparing to utilize probes to collect data during the comet's closest passage. Plans include potential interception missions for on-site analysis of the comet's internal structure, which will enhance understanding of interstellar objects and improve future defense models.</p>
