      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet 'Path Of Destruction': Is Interstellar Body Causing Today's Numerous Global Earthquakes?</h2>

<p>Scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object detected passing through our Solar System, was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile in July 2025. Despite a surge of social media claims linking the comet to recent global earthquakes, experts state there is no scientific evidence to support these assertions.</p>

<p>The Planetary Society has reported that 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun around 29 October 2025, remaining approximately 1.8 astronomical units (270 million km) from Earth. Authorities, including NASA and geophysicists, continue to emphasize that the comet poses no threat to our planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025 by ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun expected on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest point: approximately 270 million km.</li>
    <li>No scientific evidence linking the comet to recent earthquakes.</li>
    <li>Comet travels at roughly 130,000 mph (about 210,000 km/h).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS as it entered the Solar System. As it gained attention, social media users began creating viral content linking the comet to a rise in global earthquakes. Experts quickly responded, stating there is no scientific basis for these claims.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “From a physical standpoint, 3I/ATLAS is simply too far away to influence Earth,” a representative from the Planetary Society said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Geologists emphasize that earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates, not by external cosmic influences,” stated a NASA spokesperson.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the emergence of 3I/ATLAS, other interstellar objects have been detected, but none have been linked to seismic activity on Earth. The recent surge in social media speculation highlights the ongoing trend of misinformation surrounding astronomical phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, while urging the public to approach social media claims with skepticism. Investigations into the origins of misinformation are ongoing.</p>
