      <h2>NASA adds 3I/Atlas to an official watchlist as a ‘planetary threat’</h2>

<p>NASA has added the comet 3I/Atlas to the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) and described it as a possible “planetary threat” to Earth. The comet was first observed on July 1 and has exhibited unusual behaviour that has raised concerns among scientists.</p>

<p>This designation matters as it prompts global collaboration among astronomers and space agencies to monitor the comet's trajectory and characteristics. IAWN plans to initiate a “comet campaign” from November 27 to January 27, 2026, to refine detection methods and track 3I/Atlas in an effort to defend Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas first spotted on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet exhibits “anti-tail” behaviour, spraying particles towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>Releases nickel, unlike typical comets which usually release iron.</li>
    <li>Travelling at a speed of 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>IAWN's comet campaign scheduled from November 27, 2023, to January 27, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers first detected 3I/Atlas. Since then, scientists have noted its unusual behaviour, including the release of particles towards the Sun instead of away from it. This has led to increased scrutiny and the decision to add it to the IAWN watchlist.</p>
<p>IAWN announced plans for a comet campaign to enhance detection methods and track 3I/Atlas. The campaign will run from late November 2023 to late January 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The alloy has previously been witnessed only in human manufacturing,” said Professor Avi Loeb, highlighting the comet's unusual composition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“To prepare for the campaign, we will hold a workshop on techniques to correctly measure comet astrometry,” IAWN stated regarding their upcoming efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the first interstellar object formally enrolled in a planetary defense-level observation campaign. Previous incidents involving comets have not prompted such extensive global monitoring efforts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/Atlas closely during the IAWN campaign, assessing its trajectory and characteristics to determine any potential risks to Earth.</p>
