      <h2>Insurance Industry Faces Silence on 3I/ATLAS While Astronomers Track Asteroids and Comets That Could Alter Risk Models</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has temporarily disappeared from view, obscured by the sun's glare, leaving the insurance industry to grapple with potential risks associated with space-related events. Astronomers expect to resume monitoring of the object once it reemerges, but insurance companies appear to be pausing their risk modeling and preparations during this lull, according to reports.</p>

<p>This situation raises concerns about the industry's ability to manage risks that could impact policyholders and shareholders. Experts warn that without proactive measures, the insurance sector may be ill-equipped to handle catastrophic events caused by asteroids or comets, which remain largely untested scenarios for insurers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has disappeared from view due to solar glare.</li>
    <li>Insurers have paused risk modeling and preparations during this time.</li>
    <li>Experts highlight that a lack of transparency in space-risk modeling poses a threat to policyholders.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) track potentially hazardous asteroids and comets.</li>
    <li>Significant events like the Chicxulub impact are millions of years in the past.</li>
    <li>Potential impacts could raise questions about insurance coverage and claims handling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, one of the strangest interstellar objects recorded, has been under observation by astronomers. Its visibility has been obstructed by the sun, prompting a temporary halt in direct monitoring. Insurance companies have responded by pausing their risk assessments, a move that experts warn could have serious implications for the industry.</p>

<p>As astronomers anticipate the object's reemergence, the need for insurance companies to address potential risks related to space events remains critical. The absence of established risk models for such events presents a significant challenge for insurers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The industry’s lack of transparency in answering questions about space-event risks is tantamount to dereliction,” said an industry expert. “Policyholders deserve clear answers about how their coverage would respond to catastrophic events from space.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, the insurance industry has managed risks associated with natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. However, space-related events are unprecedented, and the lack of recent benchmarks makes it difficult for insurers to prepare adequately. With the increasing discovery of hazardous asteroids, experts argue that ignoring these risks is no longer defensible.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As astronomers continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and other potential threats, the insurance industry faces pressure to develop comprehensive risk models for space-related events. Industry stakeholders are calling for increased transparency and proactive measures to ensure policyholders are protected against unforeseen catastrophes.</p>
