      <h2>The space mystery of the year: why is this interstellar object entering our Solar System?</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/Atlas has entered our solar system, sparking intrigue among astronomers since its discovery in early July 2025. The object is currently traveling at approximately 220,000 kilometers per hour (about 137,000 mph) and is on a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it is not bound to our solar system. NASA has confirmed that 3I/Atlas poses no threat to Earth, as it will not come closer than 270 million kilometers (about 168 million miles) from our planet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it offers scientists a unique opportunity to study an interstellar object and gain insights into the formation of planetary systems outside our own. Observations of 3I/Atlas have already revealed its cometary nature, with a coma that has been growing as it approaches the Sun. Astronomers are using various space telescopes to gather data on this intriguing visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: 220,000 kilometers per hour (137,000 mph)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 270 million kilometers (168 million miles)</li>
    <li>Closest point to the Sun: Approximately 210 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Notable emissions: CO₂, cyanide, nickel</li>
    <li>Estimated age: Formed around 7 billion years ago</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in early July 2025 as part of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. Initial observations confirmed its cometary nature and detected a reddish halo around the object. By late October 2025, it will reach its closest point to the Sun, just inside Mars’s orbit.</p>

<p>In August 2025, NASA's SPHEREx mission captured observations of 3I/Atlas, contributing valuable data to the study of the comet. The Hubble Space Telescope later provided additional images, revealing the size of the comet's core to be between 0.32 and 5.6 kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/Atlas gives astronomers a rare look into how planetary systems form outside our own,” said a NASA spokesperson. “It’s an exciting opportunity to compare its building blocks with what we know about our solar system’s history.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each discovery has provided astronomers with valuable data on the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Upcoming observations from NASA's Psyche mission and other probes will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it exits the solar system. The Hubble Space Telescope will analyze gas emissions in November, while the James Webb Space Telescope is expected to observe the comet again in December 2025.</p>
