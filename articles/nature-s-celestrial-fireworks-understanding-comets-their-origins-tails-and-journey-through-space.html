      <h2>Comet 3I ATLAS: A Celestial Journey</h2>
<p>Hyderabad: Comet 3I ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has been observed passing through the solar system, providing a unique opportunity for astronomers to study its characteristics. The comet is currently visible from Earth, with no reported injuries or fatalities associated with its passage.</p>

<p>This event is significant for the scientific community as it allows researchers to gain insights into the origins and composition of comets. Authorities, including NASA, are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and encouraging the public to observe this rare celestial phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS is an interstellar comet currently passing through the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet is visible from Earth, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</li>
    <li>NASA is monitoring the comet's trajectory and providing updates to the public.</li>
    <li>Comets are believed to be remnants from the solar system's formation 4.6 billion years ago.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS offers valuable data about the building blocks of life, such as water and organic compounds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS has been making its way through the solar system, drawing attention from astronomers and the public alike. Its trajectory has been tracked since its discovery, offering insights into its origins and behavior.</p>

<p>As comets approach the Sun, they undergo significant changes due to the heat, which causes their icy components to vaporize and form a coma and tail. This process has been observed in Comet 3I ATLAS, as it displays a bright atmosphere and distinctive tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comets like 3I ATLAS provide crucial information about the early solar system and the materials that may have contributed to the development of life on Earth,” said a NASA official.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are classified into two main categories: short-period comets, which orbit the Sun in less than 200 years, and long-period comets, which can take millions of years to complete an orbit. Comet 3I ATLAS is a long-period comet, likely originating from the Oort Cloud, a distant region of icy bodies.</p>

<p>This comet's passage through the solar system marks a rare event, as long-period comets are less predictable and appear infrequently. The study of such comets helps enhance our understanding of the solar system's formation and evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will conduct further observations to gather data on its composition and behavior. NASA will provide updates on its trajectory and visibility as it moves through the inner solar system.</p>
