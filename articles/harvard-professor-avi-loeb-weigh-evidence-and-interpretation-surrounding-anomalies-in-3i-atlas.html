      <h2>Harvard Professor Avi Loeb Weighs Evidence and Interpretation Surrounding Anomalies in 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard Professor Avi Loeb has discussed the anomalies associated with the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which was first reported by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025. The comet has drawn attention due to its unusual trajectory and physical properties, which differ from typical solar system comets. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the nature of interstellar objects and their behaviors. Loeb emphasizes the importance of examining the anomalies without prior expectations, highlighting that they represent measurable deviations from previously observed cometary behavior. Authorities, including NASA, have been actively observing 3I/ATLAS using various telescopes to gather data on its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Pre-discovery observations date back to June 14, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is approximately 1.8 astronomical units from Earth at its closest approach.</li>
    <li>It will reach perihelion around October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers in size.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of the comet's nucleus on July 21, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was reported to the Minor Planet Center by the ATLAS survey telescope on July 1, 2025. Pre-discovery observations were identified in archives of other ATLAS telescopes and Caltech’s Zwicky Transient Facility, extending back to June 14, 2025. NASA's ongoing observations have included multiple instruments to analyze the comet's trajectory and physical characteristics.</p>

<p>On July 21, 2025, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of the comet's nucleus, which was surrounded by a dust cocoon. This observation contributed to the understanding of the comet's unusual speed and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Anomalies are by definition unexpected, and their relevance does not depend on whether they were predicted,” said Loeb, emphasizing the need for systematic observation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb noted that “unexpected deviations in physical or chemical behavior should be documented regardless of prior forecasting,” highlighting the importance of empirical evidence.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects is a growing field in astronomy, with 3I/ATLAS being the third known interstellar object. Previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, have also sparked significant scientific discussion and debate regarding their origins and characteristics.</p>

<p>Loeb's approach to the anomalies of 3I/ATLAS aligns with the scientific principle of observing unexpected phenomena without imposing interpretations or predictions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue as scientists aim to confirm or refute potential explanations for its anomalies. Further data collection is expected as the comet approaches perihelion in late October 2025.</p>
