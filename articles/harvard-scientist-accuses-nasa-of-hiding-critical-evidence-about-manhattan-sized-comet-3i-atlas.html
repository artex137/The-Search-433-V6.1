      <h2>Harvard scientist accuses NASA of ‘hiding’ critical evidence about Manhattan-sized comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has accused NASA of withholding crucial information regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience. Loeb alleged that a significant image of the comet, captured by NASA’s HiRISE camera on October 2, 2025, has not been released to the public. He claimed the image was taken when 3I/ATLAS came within 30 million kilometres of Mars.</p>

<p>This accusation raises concerns about transparency in scientific data related to space exploration. NASA has not confirmed the existence of the photograph or any claims of withholding information. The Post has reached out to NASA for comment.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Image Capture:</strong> October 2, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> 30 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Scientist Involved:</strong> Avi Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Event Location:</strong> Joe Rogan Experience</li>
    <li><strong>NASA Mission:</strong> Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, Avi Loeb discussed 3I/ATLAS on the Joe Rogan Experience, highlighting unusual characteristics of the comet. He mentioned that the comet exhibited a jet-like emission pointing towards the sun, contrary to typical comet behaviour, and stated that he did not observe a cometary tail.</p>
<p>Loeb revealed that the best image of 3I/ATLAS was taken on October 2, 2025, and expressed frustration over NASA’s lack of response to his request for data from the HiRISE camera. He emphasized that the image's release could have countered NASA's claims about the comet's behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “I wrote to the principal investigator of HiRISE, asking, ‘Can I get the data? I’m a scientist,’” adding he received “no response.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb later remarked, “It’s much more likely not to be related to extraterrestrial intelligence, but to terrestrial stupidity.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to enter the solar system. Loeb has previously suggested that its unusual features could indicate extraterrestrial origins. He noted that the comet was releasing a plume of four grams of nickel per second without evidence of iron, which is atypical for comets. NASA’s official stance is that 3I/ATLAS does not pose a threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>From November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) will conduct a “comet campaign” to improve methods for tracking comets, including 3I/ATLAS. The coalition will also hold a workshop focused on comet astrometry techniques.</p>
