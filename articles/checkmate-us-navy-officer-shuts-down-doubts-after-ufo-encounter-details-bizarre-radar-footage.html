      <h2>'Checkmate': US Navy Officer Shuts Down Doubts After UFO Encounter, Details Bizarre Radar Footage</h2>

<p>A US Navy officer has confirmed the sighting of four Tic-Tac-shaped UFOs off the coast of California while aboard the USS Jackson on February 15, 2023. Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins reported that he observed the first unidentified object emerging from the ocean, leading to a notable exchange with a skeptical radar official.</p>

<p>This incident highlights ongoing concerns about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the Navy's commitment to transparency in investigating such encounters. Wiggins' testimony, along with radar footage released in April, has attracted attention and sparked discussions on the nature of these unidentified objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: February 15, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of California</li>
    <li>Vessel: USS Jackson</li>
    <li>Witness: Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins</li>
    <li>Radar footage released: April 2023</li>
    <li>Testified before: House Transparency Task Force</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 15, 2023, Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins witnessed a Tic-Tac-shaped UFO emerge from the ocean while stationed on the USS Jackson. After confirming the sighting on radar, he alerted a tactical officer and observed three additional objects in the vicinity. In April, video footage showing the radar tracking the event was released on the Weaponized podcast by George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell.</p>

<p>During the radar analysis, a commercial aircraft was detected, which had a distinct shape compared to the unidentified objects. This led Wiggins to assert the reality of the UFOs, marking a significant moment of validation for his observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What am I seeing? From my observations, it did in fact come from the water,” Wiggins explained during an interview with The NewYork Post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It was kind of like ‘Checkmate,’ and he sat back down,” Wiggins noted, referring to the radar operator’s change in demeanor after the commercial aircraft was identified.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Even if I were to second-guess myself before, I no longer could,” Wiggins added, emphasizing his confidence in the sighting.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting is part of a broader pattern of UAP encounters reported by military personnel. The U.S. government has increased efforts to investigate these phenomena, leading to hearings and discussions aimed at transparency and understanding of aerial threats. Wiggins’ testimony contributes to the growing body of evidence surrounding UAP incidents.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The House Transparency Task Force is expected to continue its investigations into UAP sightings, with further testimonies and analysis planned to enhance understanding of these encounters.</p>
