      <h2>James Webb Telescope reveals 15-20 meter irradiated crust on interstellar comet 3I/Atlas by cosmic rays</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has identified a radiating crust 15 to 20 meters deep on interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which was observed in November 2025 as it moved away from perihelion, its closest point to the Sun. The comet, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile, is the third interstellar object confirmed in the Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the comet's long journey through the Milky Way and its exposure to galactic cosmic rays. Astronomers are now analyzing the chemical composition of the comet to understand its evolution and characteristics better.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The crust formation has resulted from billions of years of exposure to cosmic rays.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma has a carbon dioxide to water ratio of 7.6, one of the highest recorded.</li>
    <li>Current speed of the comet is more than 80 km/s as it heads towards the exit of the Solar System.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was first discovered in July 2025. It exhibited cometary activity in May 2025, as noted by the TESS satellite. The James Webb Telescope captured spectroscopic data between October 17 and 20, 2025, near perihelion. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, and has been moving away since. It passed Mars at 0.19 astronomical units in October 2025 and is expected to approach Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The crust acts as an insulator, suppressing the sublimation of water compared to CO2,” said a spokesperson for the James Webb project, highlighting the unique characteristics of 3I/Atlas.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery aligns with previous findings about interstellar objects. Comet 3I/Atlas shows significant differences from Solar System comets, which typically maintain primitive compositions. The study of such objects is crucial to understanding the diversity and evolution of comets and their origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/Atlas to gather more data on its composition and trajectory. Ongoing studies will help calibrate models for future interstellar visitors and enhance our understanding of cosmic radiation's effects on chemical evolution.</p>
