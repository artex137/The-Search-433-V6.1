      <h2>Probes race to study mysterious 3I/Atlas, a Manhattan-sized space object passing through our solar system</h2>

<p>Scientists are urgently studying a large space object named 3I/Atlas, which is currently traversing our solar system. The object, approximately the size of Manhattan, is moving at high speeds and may originate from outside our solar system, according to astronomers from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawaii.</p>

<p>This investigation is significant because 3I/Atlas could be only the third known interstellar visitor, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. NASA and other space agencies are assessing whether any existing spacecraft can be redirected to observe 3I/Atlas closely before it becomes too faint to study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately the size of Manhattan</li>
    <li>Origin: Potentially from outside our solar system</li>
    <li>Discovery: Found by ATLAS in Hawaii</li>
    <li>Speed: Moving faster than most bodies in the solar system</li>
    <li>Significance: Could provide insights into solar system formation and extraterrestrial materials</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>2017: Astronomers discover ‘Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object.</p>
<p>2019: Comet Borisov, another interstellar visitor, is detected and studied.</p>
<p>2023: 3I/Atlas is discovered, prompting immediate investigation by NASA and other agencies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If scientists can capture even a few close-up images or readings, it would be a big win,” a NASA spokesperson said. “It could show what the object is made of, how it moves, and whether it has a tail, like a comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first encounter with interstellar objects. The discovery of ‘Oumuamua sparked various theories about its nature, while Comet Borisov allowed for some degree of study, confirming that interstellar comets can carry similar materials to those found in our solar system. Scientists are now eager to avoid missing another opportunity to study an interstellar object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies are working quickly to determine if any missions can be adjusted to observe 3I/Atlas before it moves beyond a detectable distance. Ground-based telescopes are also monitoring the object to gather as much data as possible while it remains within range.</p>
