      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS approaching Sun soon: Here’s what to expect</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to approach the Sun around October 29 and October 30, 2025. It is predicted to pass at a distance of approximately 1.4 astronomical units (au), or 210 million kilometers, just within Mars' orbit. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This approach is significant for astronomers and scientists, who are studying the comet's size and physical properties. According to a NASA official from the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), the comet originated beyond our solar system, making it a rare subject of study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach the Sun on October 29 and 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass at a distance of 1.4 au (210 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>It was detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object discovered in our solar system.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be about 1.8 au.</li>
    <li>The comet has been visible to ground-based telescopes since September 2025.</li>
    <li>It is currently obscured by the Sun's glare.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Since then, astronomers have monitored its trajectory and physical properties. The comet will make its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, which is anticipated to alter its structure significantly.</p>

<p>As it approaches the Sun, the heat will likely cause its ices to vaporize, creating a coma and a tail that can extend millions of miles. It has been visible to telescopes since September 2025, but it will become too close to the Sun for observation later in October 2025. The comet is expected to re-emerge on the opposite side of the Sun in early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known object from outside our solar system to be discovered passing through our celestial neighborhood,” said a NASA official from CNEOS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is a genuine Black Swan occurrence,” the official added, referring to the rarity and significance of the event.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The term "Black Swan" describes unexpected events with substantial consequences. Comet 3I/ATLAS joins a select group of interstellar objects that have been detected, providing valuable insights into the behavior of comets originating from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its approach to the Sun, scientists will continue to study 3I/ATLAS once it becomes visible again in early December 2025, allowing for further observations and analysis of its characteristics.</p>
