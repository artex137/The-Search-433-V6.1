      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS emits radio signal and activates NASA Planetary Defense monitoring</h2>

<p>NASA's Planetary Defense team has mobilized in response to the detection of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, first identified by the ATLAS telescope in RÃ­o Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025. The comet, which is the third known to originate outside the Solar System, has been emitting radio waves and is following a hyperbolic trajectory at approximately 100,000 km/h relative to the Sun.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it marks a unique passage of an interstellar object through the Solar System. Authorities are closely monitoring the comet due to its atypical behavior, which has raised concerns about its potential impact on Earth, although calculations indicate there is no risk of collision.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Initial detection: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in RÃ­o Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Comet speed: Approximately 100,000 km/h relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Core diameter: Between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Minimum approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million km.</li>
    <li>Radio signal detected: October 24, 2025, at 1.6 GHz by the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>No risk of impact confirmed by NASA and ESA calculations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope detected 3I/ATLAS, identifying it as a potential threat. NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office convened experts in August 2025 to establish monitoring protocols. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT telescope captured a radio signal from the comet, confirming its active status as a comet rather than an asteroid. Ongoing observations have continued to assess the comet's composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The emission reinforces classification as an active comet, ruling out an asteroid,” said a representative from NASA’s Planetary Defense team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as a fragment expelled from another star system millions of years ago. Its stability differs from other interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, which exhibited intense outgassing. The ongoing studies aim to enrich knowledge about debris ejection in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS with global radio telescopes, analyzing variations in its composition and activity as it approaches Earth.</p>
