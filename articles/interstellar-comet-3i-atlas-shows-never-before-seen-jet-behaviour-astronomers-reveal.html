      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows never-before-seen jet behaviour, astronomers reveal</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected a narrow jet of material emerging from the sunlit side of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, following its close pass by Earth on December 19, 2025. This jet exhibits unique oscillating behaviour, marking a milestone in the study of interstellar comets.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it provides new insights into the rotation and composition of a comet originating from outside the Solar System. Researchers are utilizing this information to better understand comet formation across the galaxy. The observations were made using the Two-metre Twin Telescope (TTT) at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, highlighting the comet's dynamic nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS early-warning system.</li>
    <li>Close pass by Earth occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted over nearly 40 nights between July and September 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus completes one rotation every 14 to 17 hours.</li>
    <li>Jets have been studied for decades in Solar System comets, but this is the first observation of such a jet in an interstellar comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers first detected interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approached the inner Solar System. Observations continued for nearly 40 nights until September 2025. On December 19, 2025, the comet made a close pass by Earth, during which researchers noted the presence of a narrow jet of gas and dust.</p>

<p>Throughout this observing campaign, scientists documented the comet's unique oscillating jet behaviour, which rotates around the comet's axis, resembling a "dancing" motion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By comparing its activity with that of Solar System comets, astronomers can better understand whether comet formation follows similar rules across the galaxy,” one of the study's authors stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Analyzing jets on an interstellar comet like 3I/ATLAS helps scientists understand the physical processes shaping bodies formed in completely different planetary systems,” the author added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previously, jets have been common features of comets within the Solar System, but the observation of such behaviour in an interstellar comet is unprecedented. This discovery allows researchers to study interstellar visitors as dynamic objects rather than merely brief curiosities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study the behaviour and composition of 3I/ATLAS to gain further insights into its internal structure and history, contributing to the understanding of comet formation in various planetary systems.</p>
