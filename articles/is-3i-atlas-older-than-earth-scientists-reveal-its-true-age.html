      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS Older Than Earth? Scientists Reveal Its True Age</h2>

<p>Scientists have discovered that the comet 3I/ATLAS may be significantly older than Earth, as it travels through space at an extraordinary speed. The comet was detected on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Its journey through the Milky Way could span billions of years longer than the history of our solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery has sparked discussions among astronomers regarding the age and origin of 3I/ATLAS. Current research aims to determine whether the comet predates Earth itself and to better understand its composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected on July 1, 2025, at 61 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Located approximately 4.51 AU from the Sun at the time of discovery.</li>
    <li>Officially named 3I/ATLAS on July 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus diameter of less than 1-5.6 km.</li>
    <li>Brightened to magnitude 9.7 by November 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached at 1.356 AU on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Potential age estimated between 3-11 billion years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS's journey began with its detection on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Initial observations confirmed its cometary nature, leading to its official naming on July 2, 2025. Precovery images extended its observation arc back to May 2025, and follow-up studies have revealed details about its composition and trajectory.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun. By November 8, 2025, a visible tail was observed as the comet brightened. Ongoing studies using various telescopes aim to gather more data about its properties and potentially confirm its age.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the chemistry of ancient stars and the conditions that led to the formation of our solar system,” said a lead researcher from the project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its potential age raises questions about the formation of celestial bodies and the timeline of star formation in the Milky Way. Understanding its origins could shed light on the early universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations are planned using the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope, particularly post-perihelion in December 2025. These studies aim to further investigate the comet's composition and confirm its age, contributing to ongoing debates in the scientific community.</p>
