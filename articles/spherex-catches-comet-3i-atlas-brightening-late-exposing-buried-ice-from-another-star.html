      <h2>SPHEREx catches comet 3I/ATLAS brightening late, exposing buried ice from another star</h2>

<p>NASA's SPHEREx spacecraft has observed comet 3I/ATLAS brightening unexpectedly, revealing buried ice from a distant star. The observation took place in late October 2023, as the comet approached the inner solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the composition of comets and the materials present in the early solar system. NASA scientists have stated that the findings could enhance understanding of the origins of water and other essential elements on Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed in late October 2023</li>
    <li>SPHEREx spacecraft operated by NASA</li>
    <li>Discovery includes buried ice from another star</li>
    <li>Potential implications for understanding Earth's water origins</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2023, the SPHEREx spacecraft captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS as it exhibited increased brightness. This event marked a notable moment in the study of comets and their composition.</p>

<p>NASA scientists have analyzed the data collected from the observation, focusing on the comet's ice and other materials. This analysis could lead to further discoveries about the formation of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The brightening of comet 3I/ATLAS provides an exciting opportunity to study the materials that make up these celestial bodies,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader category of comets that scientists study to understand the building blocks of planetary systems. Previous observations of comets have revealed significant information about the early solar system, including the distribution of water and organic compounds.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue analyzing the data from SPHEREx to uncover more about comet 3I/ATLAS and its implications for understanding the solar system's history. Further observations may be scheduled as the comet continues its journey.</p>
