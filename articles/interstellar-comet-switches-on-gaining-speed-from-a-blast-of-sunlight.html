      <h2>Interstellar comet 'switches on,' gaining speed from a blast of sunlight</h2>

<p>On a late August night in Chile, astronomers at the Gemini South telescope observed Comet 3I/ATLAS, marking its transformation into a classic comet. The comet, only the third confirmed interstellar comet, has shown a brighter coma and an extended tail as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study the comet's composition and behavior as it interacts with sunlight. The data collected during this observation will help scientists understand the materials that make up comets from other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed on a late August night in 2023.</li>
    <li>The observations were conducted at the Gemini South telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma has become broader and brighter, with a tail approximately 1/120th of a degree wide.</li>
    <li>Images and spectra were captured using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS).</li>
    <li>The session was part of a live, guided field trip organized by NOIRLab and Shadow the Scientists.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey.</li>
    <li>A follow-up observation is scheduled for November 2023 from Gemini North on Maunakea.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was first flagged by the ATLAS survey. In late August 2023, the Gemini South telescope captured images of the comet as it gained brightness and speed due to sunlight. The observation session included participation from students and the public via Zoom, allowing real-time engagement with the scientific process.</p>

<p>During this session, astronomers aimed to capture precise colors and a spectrum of the comet. The data revealed changes in the tail's structure and provided insights into the comet's chemical composition.</p>

<p>A follow-up observation is planned for November 2023, allowing further examination of the comet as it emerges from the Sun's glare.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We were excited to see the growth of the tail, suggesting a change in the particles from the previous Gemini images, and we got our first glimpse of the chemistry from the spectrum,” said Karen Meech, project lead and astronomer at the University of Hawaiʻi Institute for Astronomy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These observations provide both a breathtaking view and critical scientific data,” said Bryce Bolin of Eureka Scientific. “Every interstellar comet is a messenger from another star system, and by studying their light and color, we can begin to understand the diversity of worlds beyond our own.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of two previous interstellar comets: 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike typical comets that return to the Sun in predictable orbits, 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory, which means it will not return after this pass. The study of interstellar comets is crucial for understanding the chemical makeup of materials from other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the November observation, scientists will analyze the new data to further investigate the comet's composition and behavior. This research contributes to a better understanding of the origins of comets and the chemistry of planet-forming disks around other stars.</p>
