      <h2>Manhattan-Sized 3I/ATLAS Accelerates, Shows Potential Signs Of Having Alien ‘Engine’ After Turning Blue</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object the size of Manhattan, has shown signs of non-gravitational acceleration as it approaches the Sun, according to NASA. The object has been observed to be “bluer than the Sun,” raising questions about its composition and origin.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it could indicate the presence of an alien craft or engine, according to Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb. NASA has recorded the object’s acceleration, which suggests substantial outgassing typical of comets. This phenomenon could lead to 3I/ATLAS losing half of its mass in the coming months and producing a large stream of debris.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: Comparable to Manhattan</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: Closest approach at 172 million miles</li>
    <li>Anticipated closest Earth passing: December 19, approximately 167 million miles away</li>
    <li>Recorded by: NASA and multiple crafts orbiting the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has exhibited non-gravitational acceleration and a distinct blue color as it nears the Sun. NASA observed these changes, which are typically associated with cometary outgassing. Avi Loeb's analysis of the object has suggested that its characteristics may indicate it is not just a comet but possibly an artificial craft.</p>
<p>As the object continues its trajectory, astronomers are preparing for its closest approach to Earth in December, which will provide a crucial opportunity to study its nature further.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Alternatively, the non-gravitational acceleration might be the technological signature of an internal engine.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb added, “It could potentially be explained by a hot engine or source of artificial light.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS are part of ongoing research into interstellar objects. Previous studies have indicated a variety of colors and characteristics, with 3I/ATLAS previously appearing red before transitioning to green. The current blue observation is unexpected and may change the understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, researchers plan to utilize telescopes and other instruments to gather data that may clarify whether the object is a comet or an artificial craft. The upcoming closest approach on December 19 will be pivotal in this investigation.</p>
