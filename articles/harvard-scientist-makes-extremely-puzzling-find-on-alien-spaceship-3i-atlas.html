      <h2>Harvard scientist makes 'extremely puzzling' find on 'alien spaceship' 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A Harvard scientist has proposed a theory about comet 3I/ATLAS following its closest approach to Earth at around 6 a.m. (UK time) on 19 December. Physicist Avi Loeb has speculated that 3I/ATLAS could represent a "potentially hostile alien threat" as it travels through space at an estimated speed of 246,000 km/h.</p>

<p>This theory has gained attention as NASA continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS, which has been classified as a comet. Loeb's claims challenge the prevailing scientific view, leading to discussions about the nature of the object and its composition. The findings could impact our understanding of comets and their origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Close approach occurred on 19 December at 6 a.m. (UK time).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is travelling at approximately 246,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Closest distance to Earth was about 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Due to pass Jupiter in early 2026.</li>
    <li>Expected to cross the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune by 2028.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as a comet and has been under observation by NASA. On 19 December, it made its closest approach to Earth, sparking new theories about its composition.</p>
<p>In October, Avi Loeb noted anomalies in the comet's coma, including the presence of nickel and iron atoms, which he argues should not exist at the observed temperatures. This led to his speculation about the comet's potential origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The presence of nickel and iron atoms in cometary coma is extremely puzzling,” said Avi Loeb. “Being honest about what we do not know would motivate us to seek answers.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things,” said NASA scientist Tom Statler. “The evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It’s a comet.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate around 3I/ATLAS highlights ongoing discussions in the scientific community about the nature of celestial objects. Previous findings of unusual properties in comets have raised questions about their formation and composition.</p>
<p>NASA's monitoring of comets has provided valuable insights into the early solar system, and discoveries like 3I/ATLAS contribute to our understanding of these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from Earth. Further research may help clarify the anomalies observed by Loeb and contribute to our understanding of the comet's origins and behavior.</p>
