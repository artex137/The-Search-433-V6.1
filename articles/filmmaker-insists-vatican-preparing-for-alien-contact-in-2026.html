      <h2>Filmmaker insists Vatican preparing for alien contact in 2026</h2>

<p>A British filmmaker has claimed that the Vatican may be preparing for the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life, with the Pope possibly addressing "first contact" in 2026. Mark Christopher Lee, a UFO researcher, stated he has received "rare access" to the Vatican's confidential archives to investigate historical accounts of mysterious phenomena, according to reports from the Daily Star.</p>

<p>This assertion raises questions about the Catholic Church's readiness to confront the implications of extraterrestrial existence. Lee believes the Church is already considering the theological and spiritual ramifications of such a discovery.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee has accessed the Vatican's confidential archives.</li>
<li>Lee is investigating historical references related to unexplained phenomena.</li>
<li>He produced a documentary titled "God Vs Aliens."</li>
<li>Father Gabriel Funes has previously suggested that extraterrestrial life would not conflict with belief in God.</li>
<li>Pope Leo XIV's astronomer expressed willingness to baptise an alien.</li>
<li>Father Richard D'Souza leads the Vatican Observatory and has commented on the need for theological reimagining.</li>
<li>The year 2026 is suggested as pivotal for potential confirmation of intelligent life beyond Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee has recently gained access to the Vatican's archives, where he is conducting research on historical accounts of mysterious phenomena. This follows previous statements by Vatican astronomers regarding the compatibility of belief in God with the existence of extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<p>In 2008, Father Gabriel Funes articulated that intelligent beings created by God could exist in outer space, suggesting that such a belief does not contradict Catholic faith. Earlier this year, Father Richard D'Souza indicated the need for the Church to rethink its theology should contact with intelligent life occur.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<strong>Mark Christopher Lee:</strong> "I've been given rare access to the Vatican's secret archives. I'll be looking for any historical references to unexplained phenomena, spiritual encounters, or anything that could shed light on humanity's possible contact with intelligent life beyond Earth."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Mark Christopher Lee:</strong> "The new Pope could become the first spiritual leader in history to address First Contact - and I intend to find out how prepared the Church really is."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Father Gabriel Funes:</strong> "Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures over the earth, so there could be other beings, even intelligent (beings), created by God. This is not in contradiction with our faith."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Father Richard D'Souza:</strong> "They are all part of God's creation. The question would be how to reach them or how they would reach us."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Vatican has previously explored the intersection of faith and extraterrestrial life. In 2008, Father Gabriel Funes's comments indicated a progressive stance on the existence of aliens. The Church's openness to the possibility of intelligent beings has evolved, with recent statements from Father Richard D'Souza emphasizing the need for theological adaptation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee plans to continue his research into the Vatican archives and investigate what the Church may reveal regarding potential contact with extraterrestrial life. Further developments may emerge as the year 2026 approaches.</p>
