      <h2>Avi Loeb calculates risks of cyanide from comet 3I/Atlas reaching Earth after passage</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas reached its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 269 million kilometers. Astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University has assessed the potential risks associated with materials released by the comet, including cyanide, and found no threat to Earth's safety.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it addresses concerns about the dispersion of toxic gases from the comet. Authorities have been monitoring the comet's passage closely using both terrestrial and space observatories to ensure public safety.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Minimum distance to Earth: 269 million km</li>
    <li>Comet detected: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Comet speed: Exceeds 60 km/s</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Dominant composition: Carbon dioxide (CO2), with traces of cyanide and nickel</li>
    <li>Estimated number of large solid particles released: Fewer than one million</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile. After a series of observations, it reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun. The comet approached Earth on December 19, 2025, without any risk of collision, maintaining a minimum separation of 1.8 astronomical units.</p>
<p>During its approach, telescopes including Hubble and James Webb observed changes in the comet's coma, which shifted from reddish to green tones due to gas release. Continuous monitoring has confirmed that the dispersion of materials, including cyanide, has not posed a danger to the atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Calculations confirm negligible probability of solid impact. The release of material remains low for relevant risk.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb emphasized, “Cyanide does not reach dangerous levels near Earth. Orbital distances provide additional protection.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Previous studies of interstellar comets have provided insights into their origins and compositions, contributing to our understanding of celestial bodies from beyond the Solar System. The monitoring of such objects is crucial for assessing any potential risks they may pose to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Continuous monitoring of comet 3I/Atlas and similar objects will remain a priority for ESA and NASA. Further observations will help scientists learn more about the formation of interstellar bodies and their interactions with the Solar System.</p>
