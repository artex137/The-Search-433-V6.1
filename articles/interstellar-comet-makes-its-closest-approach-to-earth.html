      <h2>Interstellar comet makes its closest approach to Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet known as 3I/Atlas is set to pass within 269 million kilometres of Earth on Friday, marking its closest approach during its journey through the solar system. Discovered on July 1, the comet is estimated to be between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres in size. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers and space enthusiasts, as NASA continues to monitor the comet with its space telescopes. The comet is currently fading as it moves away from Earth, making this week an ideal time for backyard astronomers to observe it in the night sky. Paul Chodas, director of NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies, noted that the comet will come closer to Jupiter in March, passing within 53 million kilometres.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will pass Earth at a distance of 269 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>It is estimated to be between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres in size.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on July 1.</li>
    <li>NASA's Atlas telescope in Chile detected the comet while searching for asteroids.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will reach interstellar space in the mid-2030s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first discovered on July 1. NASA's Atlas telescope detected the comet while surveying for potentially hazardous asteroids. This week, the comet is making its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 269 million kilometres. It is expected to pass closer to Jupiter in March, at a distance of 53 million kilometres.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is fading as it exits, so now is the time for backyard astronomers to catch it in the night sky with their telescopes,” said Paul Chodas, director of NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is notable as the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system. The first confirmed interstellar visitor was discovered in 2017, followed by another in 2019, spotted by a Crimean amateur astronomer. Interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas originate from star systems outside our own, unlike comets such as Halley's, which form in the icy regions of the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach to Earth, 3I/Atlas will continue its journey toward interstellar space, where it is expected to reach by the mid-2030s. No further observations or actions are planned after this week, as the comet will not return.</p>
