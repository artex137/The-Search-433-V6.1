      <h2>3I/ATLAS Alignment: Earth Prepares For Rare View of 13-Billion-Year-Old Mystery on January 22</h2>

<p>On January 22, 2026, Earth will align with the sun and the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS at 13:00 UTC, providing a unique opportunity to study this cosmic visitor. Discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed object from another star system, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>This alignment is significant as it may shed light on the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, which has perplexed astronomers since its discovery. The alignment will allow scientists to observe the object’s unique features, including its strong 'anti-tail' and a system of three 'mini-jets.' NASA and other astronomical agencies are preparing to gather data during this rare event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date of alignment: January 22, 2026</li>
<li>Time of closest alignment: 13:00 UTC</li>
<li>Angle between sun-3I/ATLAS axis and sun-Earth axis: 0.69 degrees</li>
<li>Length of anti-tail: at least 400,000 kilometers</li>
<li>Number of mini-jets: three, arranged at 120-degree angles</li>
<li>Potential age of 3I/ATLAS: approximately 13 billion years</li>
<li>Initial spectroscopic findings: water ice, carbon dioxide, traces of nickel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile discovers 3I/ATLAS. Since then, astronomers have conducted numerous observations, noting its unusual features. The upcoming alignment on January 22, 2026, will allow for a close study of these characteristics.</p>
<p>The alignment will create a phenomenon known as the 'opposition surge,' making the object appear significantly brighter as Earth passes through a two-degree angle with 3I/ATLAS for approximately one week.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This rare alignment is more than a celestial photo opportunity; it is a high-stakes scientific moment that could finally explain why this 'interstellar vagabond' behaves like nothing ever seen in our own solar system,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system. Its predecessors, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, exhibited different characteristics and behaviors. The unusual features of 3I/ATLAS have sparked debates about whether it is a natural comet or a product of active technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the alignment, scientists will analyze data collected during this event to better understand the composition and origin of 3I/ATLAS. This may be the only opportunity to gather evidence of its long journey through space.</p>
