      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Lights Up: New Hubble Images, JUICE Teaser and the Mystery of Its ‘Heartbeat’ Jets</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has illuminated the night sky, with new images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope and a teaser from the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission, as of December 5, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event marks a significant moment for astronomers and space agencies, who are closely monitoring the comet's unique characteristics, including its unusual 'heartbeat' jets. The European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA have both emphasized the importance of studying the comet to understand its composition and behavior in the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently visible from Earth.</li>
    <li>New images have been taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>The JUICE mission is set to explore Jupiter's moons.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits 'heartbeat' jets, which are of particular interest to researchers.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the comet's visibility.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in the early 2020s. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory and behavior. On December 5, 2025, new images from Hubble have provided clearer insights into its structure and activity. The JUICE mission, which launched earlier this year, aims to gather more data on the comet as part of its broader exploration of the Jovian system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new images from Hubble are a game changer for our understanding of interstellar objects,” said an ESA spokesperson. “We are excited to see how JUICE will further enhance our knowledge of comet 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar objects to enter the solar system, following the notable visits of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. These occurrences have spurred interest in the study of such celestial bodies, leading to advancements in observational technology and mission planning.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Upcoming observations from the JUICE mission are expected to provide additional data that may clarify the comet's origins and composition.</p>
