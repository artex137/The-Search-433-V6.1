      <h2>New 3I/ATLAS picture from ESA’s Juice probe reveals the comet looking extremely active on November 4</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has released a new image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, taken by its Juice probe on November 4, 2023. The photograph shows the comet in a highly active state following its recent closest approach to the Sun, which occurred just a week earlier.</p>

<p>This image is significant as it offers insights into the behavior of comets when they approach the Sun. ESA has indicated that while the Juice probe has collected extensive data, only a small portion of one photo has been shared at this time. The full image is scheduled for release in February 2024.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Image date: November 4, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from comet to Juice probe: approximately 66 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: one week prior to image capture</li>
    <li>Image type: one-fourth of a Navigation Camera (NavCam) image</li>
    <li>Full image release expected: February 2024</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 28, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to the Sun, which typically increases its activity. The Juice probe captured the image on November 4, 2023, showcasing the comet's bright coma and two faint tails.</p>
<p>As the probe continues its journey towards Jupiter, it employs its large antenna for protection against solar radiation, using a smaller antenna to transmit images back to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The picture shows two types of tails. One is a plasma tail, made of electrically charged gas, and the second is a dust tail, composed of tiny solid particles,” ESA explained.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Both tails are faint, but they confirm that the comet is releasing material as it travels,” ESA added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it originates from outside our solar system. The activity observed in the latest image provides researchers with valuable data on the characteristics and behavior of interstellar comets.</p>
<p>Previous observations of comets have shown that they often become more active when nearing the Sun, making this image timely for ongoing scientific studies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA plans to release the full image of comet 3I/ATLAS in February 2024, which will provide additional insights into the comet's activity and characteristics.</p>
