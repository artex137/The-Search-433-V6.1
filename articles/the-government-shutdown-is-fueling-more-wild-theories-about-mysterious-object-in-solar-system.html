      <h2>Government Shutdown Fuels Speculation Around Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The mysterious interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has been moving through the Solar System during the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which began on October 1, 2023. As a result, NASA has not updated its website, leading to increased speculation about the object’s nature and origin.</p>

<p>This situation has drawn attention from scientists and conspiracy theorists alike. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has noted that the media blackout surrounding 3I/ATLAS is due to the shutdown. He has emphasized that delays in scientific reporting are typical and not indicative of extraterrestrial intelligence. As the object continues its journey, it has sparked wild theories about its potential alien origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The object made a flyby of Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's website updates have been suspended due to the government shutdown.</li>
    <li>A navigation camera on the Mars Perseverance rover captured imagery of 3I/ATLAS, located approximately 38 million kilometers from Mars.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified entering the Solar System.</li>
    <li>It will fly toward Jupiter in November 2025 before exiting the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023. On October 3, 2025, it made its closest approach to Mars, where images were captured by the Perseverance rover. The U.S. government shutdown began on October 1, 2023, affecting NASA's ability to release updates and information about the object.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has responded to inquiries about the apparent media blackout, explaining that the delays are due to the shutdown and not related to extraterrestrial phenomena. He has also provided insights into the imaging process that resulted in the observations of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Long delays are not a signature of extraterrestrial alien intelligence but rather of terrestrial human stupidity,” said Avi Loeb in a recent Medium post.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The object 3I/ATLAS follows the interstellar visitor Oumuamua, which has been the subject of speculation regarding possible alien technology. Loeb has gained notoriety for his theories about interstellar objects potentially being probes from extraterrestrial civilizations.</p>

<p>The government shutdown has added an unusual layer to the study of 3I/ATLAS, as it limits access to NASA's resources and updates. This has led to an increase in online speculation and conspiracy theories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter in November 2025, scientists hope to gather more data. The government shutdown's duration remains uncertain, but it has already impacted the dissemination of scientific information related to the object.</p>
