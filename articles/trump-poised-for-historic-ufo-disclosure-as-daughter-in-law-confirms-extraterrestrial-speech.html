      <h2>Trump poised for historic UFO disclosure as daughter-in-law confirms extraterrestrial speech</h2>

<p>Former President Donald Trump may be preparing to announce a significant disclosure about UFOs, according to comments made by his daughter-in-law, Laura Trump, during a recent podcast. She indicated that Trump has a speech ready that could address the existence of extraterrestrial life. The speculation follows a report claiming that an advisor to Trump has stated he has received authorization from world leaders to make this announcement.</p>

<p>This potential disclosure is noteworthy as it could mark the first official acknowledgment of extraterrestrial life by a world leader. The White House has not commented on the matter, but Laura Trump has suggested that the timing of the announcement could coincide with the 79th anniversary of the Roswell incident on July 8, 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of podcast:</strong> February 18, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Location of speculation:</strong> Pod Force One podcast</li>
    <li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Laura Trump</li>
    <li><strong>Initial planned announcement:</strong> United Nations General Assembly, September 2026 (moved to July 8)</li>
    <li><strong>Key incidents discussed:</strong> 2004 USS Nimitz Tic Tac encounter, 2015 USS Roosevelt GoFast and Gimbal incidents, 1947 Roswell event</li>
    <li><strong>Reported source of insider information:</strong> Mark Christopher Lee, UK-based director and ufologist</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, speculation has increased regarding a possible UFO disclosure speech by Donald Trump. Laura Trump first hinted at this during a podcast on February 18, 2026. She stated that Trump has a prepared speech that may address extraterrestrial life and mentioned that the announcement could be made on July 8, coinciding with the anniversary of the Roswell event.</p>

<p>Mark Christopher Lee, a ufologist, claimed that an advisor to Trump informed him that world leaders have authorized the former president to make this significant announcement. The speech was reportedly initially scheduled for the United Nations General Assembly in September but has since been moved up due to what Lee described as "new intelligence developments."</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He played a little coy with us. And so that, of course, led us to believe... Eric and I were like, 'Oh my gosh, if he won't even fully tell us, maybe there's more to it,'” Laura Trump said regarding her conversation with her husband and Trump.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“He will confirm that forensic analysis of recovered off-world vehicles and non-human biologics has established their extraterrestrial origin, marking the first official acknowledgment of this reality by any world leader,” Lee claimed.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UFOs has gained traction in recent years, particularly following incidents involving military personnel. In 2015, pilots and radar operators aboard the USS Roosevelt reported high-speed UFO encounters. Trump has previously expressed a cautious interest in UFOs, acknowledging that while he is skeptical, he has met credible individuals who have reported strange aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Laura Trump’s comments about her father-in-law's potential speech reflect ongoing public curiosity about UFOs and the government's transparency regarding this issue.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the date for the potential announcement approaches, further developments are expected. The White House has remained silent on the matter, and it remains to be seen whether Trump will indeed address the topic of extraterrestrial life in July.</p>
