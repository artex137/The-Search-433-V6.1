      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS reaches close proximity to Earth in December, raising chemical questions</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers, according to scientists from NASA and ESA. This event has prompted an intense observation campaign to study the comet’s unusual chemical composition, which includes an elevated presence of nickel.</p>

<p>This approach is significant as it provides a unique opportunity for astronomers to gather data on 3I/ATLAS, classified as the third interstellar object to visit our solar system. The comet was first detected in July 2025 in Chile and is expected to yield insights that challenge current models of cometary formation and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed: 61 km/s</li>
    <li>Detected by: NASA-funded Telescópio ATLAS in July 2025</li>
    <li>Mass loss: 2 million tons due to solar radiation</li>
    <li>International campaign duration: November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026</li>
    <li>Notable features: Elevated nickel-to-iron ratios, presence of organic molecules</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 2025 at the Telescópio ATLAS in Río Hurtado, Chile. Preliminary images revealed a large coma of gas and dust. By October, the comet passed 28 million kilometers from Mars without posing any risks. A significant observation occurred on November 30, 2025, when the Hubble Space Telescope captured early activity, confirming the presence of carbon dioxide and organic compounds.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Following this, it will continue its trajectory out of the solar system, with a definitive departure planned for early 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The characteristics of 3I/ATLAS challenge conventional cometary models,” said astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Universidade of Estudos. “Its elevated nickel presence and unexpected light emission raise new questions about its formation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the interstellar objects ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have also provided insights into the characteristics of materials originating from outside our solar system. Its unique composition suggests a different formation environment, potentially influenced by cosmic events billions of years ago.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue their observation efforts through the IAWN campaign until January 27, 2026, to maximize data collection on 3I/ATLAS. This will aid in understanding the comet's chemical anomalies and its implications for future studies of similar interstellar objects.</p>
