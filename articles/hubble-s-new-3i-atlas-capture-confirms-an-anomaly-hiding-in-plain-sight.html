      <h2>Hubble’s New 3I/ATLAS Capture Confirms An Anomaly Hiding In Plain Sight</h2>

<p>NASA and the Space Telescope Science Institute have released a new image of comet 3I/ATLAS, taken on November 30, 2025, which reveals an unusual feature called an anti-tail, extending toward the Sun. The image shows a smooth, spherical glow nearly 40,000 kilometers in all directions, with a narrow extension pointing sunward. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing comet models. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, suggests that the comet's behavior indicates it is shedding solid fragments rather than just dust. As December 19, 2025, approaches, astronomers are preparing for the comet's close approach to Earth, which will allow for further observation and analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date of image capture: November 30, 2025</li>
<li>Distance of anti-tail extension: approximately 60,000 kilometers</li>
<li>Key date for close approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
<li>Researcher: Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
<li>Image taken using: F350LP filter aboard Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 30, 2025, NASA and the Space Telescope Science Institute released a new image of comet 3I/ATLAS. The image revealed a previously unnoticed anti-tail feature extending toward the Sun, which contradicts traditional comet behavior. This observation has prompted further scientific investigation as the comet approaches Earth.</p>

<p>As December 19, 2025, draws near, astronomers are preparing for enhanced observations of the comet during its close approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anomaly was never subtle. It was always there, hiding in plain sight,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the significance of the new observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies of comets have mainly focused on their dust and gas emissions, which typically create tails that extend away from the Sun. The discovery of the anti-tail in 3I/ATLAS suggests that interstellar objects may exhibit behaviors not yet understood by current scientific models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As December 19 approaches, astronomers will closely monitor 3I/ATLAS for further insights into its behavior and structure, particularly regarding the anti-tail and the nucleus of the comet.</p>
