      <h2>Unexplained Disappearances and UFO Attacks in Brazil</h2>

<p>David Paulides, the author and filmmaker known for the Missing 411 series, has discussed unexplained disappearances in national parks and the government's response to these cases during a recent interview. The conversation included insights from Thiago Ticchetti, editor of UFO magazine and National Director of MUFON in Brazil, who addressed UFO attacks in Colares, Pará, Brazil, during 1977 and 1978, as well as ongoing incidents in the area.</p>

<p>This discussion highlights ongoing concerns regarding unexplained phenomena and the lack of transparency from authorities. The revelations about past and current UFO encounters in Brazil have prompted calls for comprehensive investigations and public discourse on the subject.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1977 and 1978, a series of UFO attacks occurred in Colares, Pará, Brazil. These incidents have been documented by Thiago Ticchetti, who has expressed concern over the lack of governmental response and investigation into these occurrences.

<p>During a recent public hearing in Brasilia, officials discussed the implications of these phenomena and the need for transparency in governmental investigations. The hearing reflects ongoing public interest and concern regarding both disappearances and UFO incidents.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The government has not been forthcoming about these cases, leaving many questions unanswered,” said David Paulides during the interview.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The incidents in Colares were extraordinary and deserve further examination,” emphasized Thiago Ticchetti.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discussion is part of a broader trend of increasing public interest in unexplained phenomena, particularly in relation to national parks and UFO sightings. Past incidents, such as the Colares attacks, have raised questions about governmental accountability and the handling of such cases.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating the recent UFO sightings and the historical context of the Colares incidents. Public discourse around these topics is likely to grow, especially following the recent hearing in Brasilia.</p>
