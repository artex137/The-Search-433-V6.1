      <h2>Leaked video of US military missile ‘bouncing’ off speeding UFO shown to congress</h2>

<p>A leaked video has shown a US military Hellfire missile appearing to “bounce” off a shiny object off the coast of Yemen on 30 October 2024. The footage was presented to Congress for the first time on Tuesday, 9 September 2024, during a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it raises further questions about the government's transparency regarding UFO sightings and incidents. Military whistleblowers have testified under oath that they have encountered UFOs and accused the government of covering up information related to these phenomena.</p>
