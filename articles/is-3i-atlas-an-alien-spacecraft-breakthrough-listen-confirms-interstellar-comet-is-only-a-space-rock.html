      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS An Alien Spacecraft? Breakthrough Listen Confirms Interstellar Comet Is Only a 'Space Rock'</h2>

<p>Researchers have confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS is not an alien spacecraft, but a natural icy body, as it approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in Chile, was initially a subject of speculation regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it helps clarify the nature of interstellar objects and the ongoing search for signs of extraterrestrial technology. The investigation involved an extensive search for 'technosignatures' from the comet using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2025, at approximately 167 million miles (1.7 AU).</li>
    <li>Comet travels at a speed of 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 kilometres per hour).</li>
    <li>Research led by Benjamin Jacobson-Bell from the University of California, Berkeley.</li>
    <li>Search for technosignatures conducted on December 18, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nine signals initially identified, all traced back to human-made sources.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS estimated to be between 8 and 14 billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted by the ATLAS survey in Chile. Following its discovery, scientists began a global investigation into its characteristics. On December 18, 2025, researchers conducted a search for potential technosignatures using the Green Bank Telescope. The next day, on December 19, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Past work has shown that 3I/ATLAS looks like a comet and behaves like a comet, and our observations show that, like a comet, 3I/ATLAS is not a source of technological signals,” said Benjamin Jacobson-Bell.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If we don't look, we'll never know,” Jacobson-Bell added, emphasizing the importance of continued exploration.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its discovery has prompted discussions about the potential for finding signs of extraterrestrial life in the cosmos. The scientific community aims to further refine detection techniques to enhance future searches for unusual cosmic objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves back into interstellar space, researchers will continue to develop methods for detecting interstellar objects. The recently completed Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile is expected to significantly increase the discovery rate of such objects, potentially identifying up to 70 new visitors each year.</p>
