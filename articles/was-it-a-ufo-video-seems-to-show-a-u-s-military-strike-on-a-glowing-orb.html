      <h2>Was it a UFO? Video seems to show a U.S. military strike on a glowing orb</h2>

<p>A video presented during a Congressional hearing this week appears to show a U.S. military Hellfire missile attempting to strike a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. The missile, launched from a U.S. Reaper drone, did not seem to hit the target, which continued to fly as the missile followed its own trajectory. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident has drawn attention to the ongoing investigations into Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) by the military and Congress. The video was made public for the first time during a House Oversight hearing, highlighting the military's interest in these unexplained objects. The Pentagon has not commented on the video.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Type of missile: Hellfire missile from MQ-9 Reaper drone</li>
    <li>Reported UAP sightings: More than 750 between May 2023 and June 2024</li>
    <li>Investigated UAPs: 21 deemed worthy of further investigation</li>
    <li>Congressional hearings: Third in three years regarding UAPs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a U.S. Reaper drone tracked a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen. The drone was given the green light to engage the target. A second Reaper drone fired a Hellfire missile at the orb, which reportedly swerved away from the missile, leading to questions about the missile's effectiveness.</p>

<p>During a House Oversight hearing on UAPs, Representative Eric Burlison, R-Missouri, shared the video, which was provided anonymously by a whistleblower. This marked the first public display of the footage.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’ve never seen a Hellfire missile hit a target and bounce off,” said Lue Elizondo, a former senior intelligence official with the Pentagon, in an interview with CBS News.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has reported over 750 UAP sightings in the last year and a half, with 21 of those cases warranting further investigation. Despite ongoing interest, the Pentagon has consistently stated that there is no evidence linking UAPs to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the video and the incident are expected to continue, as Congress remains focused on understanding UAPs and the military's encounters with them. Further hearings may be scheduled to discuss findings and implications for national security.</p>
