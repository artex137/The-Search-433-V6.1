      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Looks Different Than Before: New NASA Photograph</h2>

<p>NASA has released a new photograph of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, a comet discovered in early July 2023, which is now approaching its closest point to Earth, expected on December 19. The latest image was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope on November 30, when 3I/ATLAS was approximately 286 million kilometers from Earth. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to the object.</p>

<p>The new image of 3I/ATLAS is clearer than previous photographs and shows the comet against a backdrop of stars, which appear as streaks of light. NASA has not disclosed detailed observations from this latest capture, but scientists continue to monitor the object as it travels through the Solar System. 3I/ATLAS is moving at a speed of over 200,000 km/h and is expected to approach Jupiter in March 2024.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: July 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023, at approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at latest photograph: 286 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed of 3I/ATLAS: over 200,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Estimated size of nucleus: possibly over 5 kilometers</li>
    <li>Expected approach to Jupiter: March 2024, at about 50 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in early July 2023, and the Hubble Space Telescope captured its initial photograph shortly thereafter. The latest image was taken on November 30, 2023, when the comet was 286 million kilometers away from Earth. The object is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<p>Following its close approach to Earth, 3I/ATLAS will travel towards Jupiter, where it is expected to pass at a distance of about 50 million kilometers in March 2024. After this, the comet will exit the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new image of 3I/ATLAS is one of the best ahead of the comet's upcoming approach to our planet,” NASA stated in a release.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object identified in history. Some astronomers speculate that the comet may have originated in another star system 7-10 billion years ago, suggesting it has traveled through the Milky Way galaxy long before the formation of our Solar System. There are also theories proposing that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft, though this remains unverified.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ground-based and space telescopes will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and Jupiter. NASA has not disclosed any future plans or upcoming observations beyond the current monitoring efforts.</p>
