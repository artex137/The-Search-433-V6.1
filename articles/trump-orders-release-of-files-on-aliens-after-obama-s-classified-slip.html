      <h2>Trump orders release of files on aliens after Obama's 'classified' slip</h2>

<p>US President Donald Trump has directed federal agencies to identify and release government files related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life, following comments made by former President Barack Obama. Trump announced this decision on Thursday, February 20, 2026, via the Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>This order comes amid renewed government interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and follows Obama's remarks on a podcast where he stated that "aliens are real." Trump emphasized the importance of these files, stating they should include all information connected to the topic.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump announced the directive on February 20, 2026.</li>
    <li>The announcement was made on the Truth Social platform.</li>
    <li>Obama's comments on extraterrestrial life were made on a podcast earlier the same day.</li>
    <li>Trump did not specify if classified documents would be included in the release.</li>
    <li>Interest in UFOs has increased due to recent government investigations into aerial phenomena.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 20, 2026, Barack Obama appeared on a podcast and stated that aliens are real, indicating that he had not seen them and that they were not stored at Area 51. Later that day, Trump responded by directing federal agencies to identify and release files about UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Trump claimed that Obama had disclosed classified information during the podcast. He later clarified his own views on the existence of aliens, stating he did not know if they were real.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify," Trump wrote in a statement on Instagram.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds were good there was life out there. But the distances between solar systems were so great that the chances we had been visited by aliens were low." 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UFOs and UAP has surged in recent years, with the US government investigating reports of unusual aerial sightings. In March 2024, the Pentagon released a report stating it had found no proof of UAP alien technology, attributing many sightings to weather balloons and other conventional activities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Federal agencies are expected to begin the process of identifying and releasing relevant files on UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Further updates on the status of these files and any potential public disclosures have not been disclosed.</p>
