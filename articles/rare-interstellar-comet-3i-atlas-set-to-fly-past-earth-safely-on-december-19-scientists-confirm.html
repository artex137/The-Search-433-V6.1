      <h2>Rare interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS set to fly past Earth safely on December 19, scientists confirm</h2>

<p>A rare comet from outside our solar system, called 3I/ATLAS, will pass by Earth on December 19, 2023. Scientists have confirmed there is no danger as the comet will remain approximately 170 million miles away, more than twice the distance between Earth and the Sun.</p>

<p>This close pass presents a significant opportunity for astronomers to study 3I/ATLAS. The comet's proximity allows scientists to gather valuable data before it exits our solar system again.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS to pass Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
  <li>Distance during flyby: approximately 170 million miles.</li>
  <li>Comet first discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
  <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured images from about 277 million miles away.</li>
  <li>Comet size estimated between 1,400 feet to 3.5 miles wide.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers first discovered 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2023. Following its discovery, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope took a clear photo of the comet from approximately 277 million miles away. This image revealed a small icy core surrounded by a teardrop-shaped cloud of dust.</p>

<p>By September 2023, the comet became too close to the Sun for telescopes to observe. However, in early October, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), MAVEN, and Perseverance spacecraft spotted the comet again. The HiRISE camera provided the clearest image, showing 3I/ATLAS as a tiny bright puff in space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This close pass will give astronomers one of their best chances to study the comet before it leaves our solar system again,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object identified passing through our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Unlike ‘Oumuamua, which exhibited unusual behavior, 3I/ATLAS appears to act more like a typical comet. However, some of its movements have raised questions among scientists.</p>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that certain movements of the comet might indicate it could be something other than a natural comet. Most scientists, however, maintain that 3I/ATLAS is a natural object originating from another star system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its flyby on December 19, 3I/ATLAS will continue its trajectory outward and will pass near Jupiter in spring 2026, providing another opportunity for observation. Following this, the comet will exit our solar system and return to deep space, where it has traveled for billions of years.</p>
