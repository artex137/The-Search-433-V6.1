      <h2>Pic shows interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after 1st encounter with Sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has returned to view after making its closest approach to the Sun, with astronomer Qicheng Zhang capturing what is believed to be the first optical post-perihelion image of the comet at Arizona's Lowell Observatory on Friday. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it marks the comet's emergence after coming within approximately <strong>203 million kilometres</strong> of the Sun. Authorities at the Lowell Observatory are now monitoring the comet's trajectory and potential visibility across much of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: approximately 203 million kilometres</li>
    <li>First post-perihelion image captured: Friday</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Lowell Observatory, Arizona</li>
    <li>Astronomer: Qicheng Zhang</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Friday, astronomer Qicheng Zhang captured the first optical image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after it made its closest approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>The comet approached the Sun, coming within about 203 million kilometres, before returning to view, which has sparked interest among astronomers and skywatchers alike.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a remarkable opportunity for us to observe an interstellar object as it passes through our solar system,” said Qicheng Zhang.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the few interstellar comets observed, with its trajectory providing valuable data for scientists studying celestial bodies from outside our solar system. This event follows previous notable sightings of interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, which was detected in 2017.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers at the Lowell Observatory will continue to monitor the comet's trajectory as it becomes visible across the Northern Hemisphere, providing updates on its status and any potential viewing opportunities for the public.</p>
