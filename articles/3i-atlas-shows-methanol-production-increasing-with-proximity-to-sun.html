      <h2>3I/ATLAS shows methanol production increasing with proximity to Sun</h2>

<p>Observations of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in 2025 have revealed measurable production of methanol and hydrogen cyanide as the object approaches the Sun. Methanol was detected on August 28, September 18 and 22, and October 1, while hydrogen cyanide was detected on September 12 and 15.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances the understanding of chemical processes in interstellar objects. Authorities in the scientific community, including Harvard professor Avi Loeb, have noted that the findings could provide insights into the formation of complex organic molecules in space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observatory: Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA)</li>
    <li>Methanol detection dates: August 28, September 18, September 22, October 1</li>
    <li>Hydrogen cyanide detection dates: September 12, September 15</li>
    <li>Pre-perihelion distances: 2.6 to 1.7 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Significant ratio: 3I/ATLAS has one of the highest methanol-to-hydrogen-cyanide ratios observed in comets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2025, ALMA conducted observations of 3I/ATLAS as it approached the Sun. Methanol was first detected on August 28, followed by additional detections on September 18, September 22, and October 1. Hydrogen cyanide was detected earlier, on September 12 and September 15. The observations indicated that methanol production increased as the object neared the Sun, with a notable power-law dependence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The production rates of methanol increased with decreasing heliocentric distance.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous observations have detected methanol in various astronomical environments. In 2006, methanol was identified in a large cloud near a newly formed star by the MERLIN array at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. In 2016, ALMA detected methanol in a planet-forming disk around the young star TW Hydrae. The findings regarding 3I/ATLAS contribute to a growing body of knowledge about the chemical composition of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further research will continue to explore the chemical processes in 3I/ATLAS and other similar objects. Scientists aim to analyze the implications of these findings for our understanding of organic molecule formation in space.</p>
