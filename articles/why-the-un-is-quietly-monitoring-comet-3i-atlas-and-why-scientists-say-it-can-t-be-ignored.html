      <h2>Why The UN Is Quietly Monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A global network of observatories, led by the United Nations-endorsed International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), has mobilised to track the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS since its detection on 1 July 2025. The coordinated effort aims to refine planetary defence protocols and gather unprecedented data on the comet, which is moving fast enough to escape our Solar System and will never return.</p>

<p>This monitoring campaign underscores the scientific and strategic importance of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities are actively refining techniques for tracking extended cometary bodies as part of a dedicated observing campaign that runs from 27 November 2025 through 27 January 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Period:</strong> 27 November 2025 - 27 January 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Operating Agencies:</strong> IAWN, NASA, European Space Agency (ESA)</li>
    <li><strong>Observatories Involved:</strong> Over 80 worldwide</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> 29 October 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on 1 July 2025. The system, designed to scan the entire sky every 24 hours, confirmed the object's interstellar origin due to its hyperbolic trajectory.</p>

<p>On 27 November 2025, the IAWN initiated a dedicated observing campaign, enlisting observatories to improve astrometric measurements of 3I/ATLAS. The campaign will conclude on 27 January 2026, with the aim of refining techniques for tracking such celestial objects.</p>

<p>During its closest point to the Sun on 29 October 2025, 3I/ATLAS passed inside the orbit of Mars before re-emerging on the opposite side of the Sun, prompting renewed observations from Earth-based telescopes in late November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa and ESA publicly state that 3I/ATLAS shows typical cometary behaviour and poses no threat to Earth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The scientific community sees transparency and data sharing as essential.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network was established under the recommendation of the United Nations to coordinate the detection, monitoring, and characterisation of asteroids and comets that could pose hazards to Earth. This latest campaign reflects the rarity of interstellar visitors and the technical challenges they present to astronomers.</p>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has become the subject of speculation and misinformation online. Some commentators have claimed that space agencies are withholding data or that unusual behaviour suggests non-natural origins. Such claims lack substantiation from official sources.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN’s current campaign serves as a proof of concept for tracking future interstellar visitors. The data gathered will inform both immediate scientific goals and future planetary defence strategies capable of addressing potential Earth-impact risks.</p>
