      <h2>ESA’s Mars orbiters record interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in once-in-a-lifetime encounter</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s (ESA) ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express spacecraft have captured images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a close encounter on October 3, 2025, from approximately 30 million km (18.6 million miles) away. This event marks the closest observation of the comet by any spacecraft to date.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant as it represents a rare opportunity to study an object that originates from outside our Solar System. Astronomers are keen to analyze the comet's composition, which could provide insights into the materials that formed around other stars billions of years ago. The ESA has deployed both orbiters to gather data on this ancient celestial body.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: approximately 30 million km (18.6 million miles)</li>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First spotted: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar comets: 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile first identified comet 3I/ATLAS. Calculations confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not native to the Solar System. Between October 1 and 7, 2025, both the ExoMars TGO and Mars Express shifted their instruments to observe the comet, with the closest approach occurring on October 3. Mars Express utilized its Visual Monitoring Camera to capture images, while TGO employed its Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) to take high-resolution photographs of the comet.</p>

<p>Post-encounter, researchers began processing the collected data to search for chemical signatures, with the goal of understanding the comet's composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target,” said Nick Thomas, Principal Investigator of CaSSIS, highlighting the challenge faced in imaging such a distant object.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    ESA scientist Colin Wilson noted, “While the Mars orbiters are designed primarily for Martian research, it is exciting to see them adapt to completely new opportunities like this.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar visitors, with only two other such comets observed in the past: 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The detection of these objects suggests that interstellar debris may be more prevalent than previously thought. If confirmed, the age of 3I/ATLAS, estimated to be over 7 billion years, could provide a glimpse into the early formation of planetary systems in the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA plans to observe 3I/ATLAS again with the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) in November 2025, shortly after its closest approach to the Sun. Scientists expect the comet to become more active and potentially display a visible tail. Data from this observation will reach Earth around February 2026, allowing further analysis of the comet’s evolution as it travels through the inner Solar System.</p>
