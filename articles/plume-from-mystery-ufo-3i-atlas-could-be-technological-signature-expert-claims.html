      <h2>Plume from 'mystery UFO' 3I/Atlas 'could be technological signature', expert claims</h2>

<p>A mystery object known as 3I/Atlas, traveling through space at approximately 209,000 km/h, may be emitting a "technological signature" as it approaches Earth, according to Harvard professor Avi Loeb. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the object.</p>

<p>This claim has gained attention as NASA attempted to dismiss suggestions that the interstellar visitor could be an alien spacecraft. Loeb argues that recent images show a glowing plume in the direction of the object's motion, raising questions about its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/Atlas.</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 209,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Expert: Avi Loeb, Harvard professor.</li>
    <li>NASA's position: Dismissed claims of alien origin.</li>
    <li>Upcoming observations: Large ground-based telescopes, Hubble, and Webb telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, discussions surrounding 3I/Atlas have intensified as new images emerged showing a plume associated with the object. On Wednesday, NASA issued a statement to quell speculation about the object's extraterrestrial origins. Loeb has since published his observations and theories regarding the plume's potential implications.</p>

<p>Loeb has noted that the plume appears to extend ahead of the object, contrary to previous interpretations that suggested it was merely a result of solar illumination. He anticipates that data from upcoming telescope observations will clarify the nature of the jets emitted by 3I/Atlas.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "It is easy to explain a plume of gas and dust extended towards the Sun as a result of the illumination of pockets of ice by sunlight... But it is much more difficult to account for a plume extended perpendicular to the direction of the Sun and ahead of the object," said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "For now, we can only hope that the mysteries of 3I/ATLAS will be cleared by data in the next few weeks," Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The object 3I/Atlas has puzzled astronomers since its discovery, with most experts identifying it as a comet. However, Loeb's claims have drawn attention due to his suggestion that it could be an alien "mothership" on a reconnaissance mission. He has previously outlined 12 anomalies related to the space rock that support his hypothesis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations from large ground-based telescopes, as well as the Hubble and Webb telescopes, are expected in the coming weeks. These observations aim to measure the composition, speed, and mass loading rate of the jets emitted by 3I/Atlas, which may provide insights into the object's true nature.</p>
