      <h2>Final chance to see Comet 3I/ATLAS as it leaves the Solar System this weekend: How and when to watch</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is making its final appearance this weekend as it exits the solar system, providing skywatchers with one last opportunity to observe the interstellar object. The comet, first discovered on 1 July 2025 from a telescope in northern Chile, is not expected to return after this pass.</p>

<p>This rare comet, only the third known interstellar object observed, has drawn significant scientific interest due to its hyperbolic orbit. Authorities and astronomers have confirmed that it behaves like a typical comet, despite previous speculation regarding its nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is currently observable in pre-dawn skies.</li>
    <li>Observers require a telescope of at least 8 inches to detect it.</li>
    <li>A final livestream observation is scheduled for 16 January 2026 at 21:00 UTC.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project will host the livestream from Manciano, Italy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025 during observations from a remote telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Initially labeled A11pl3Z, it was later renamed C/2025 N1 ATLAS after astronomers confirmed its behavior as a comet. Its unusual motion prompted further investigation, leading to its classification as 3I/ATLAS, marking it as an interstellar object.</p>

<p>Since its discovery, scientists have tracked its trajectory, noting that it will not return after exiting the solar system. The comet is now moving rapidly away from the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Data confirms the object behaves like a comet. Observations from NASA and ESA supported this view.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no mystery threat. It likely originated near the Milky Way’s centre.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object observed, following the detection of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. The interest surrounding these objects has grown significantly, particularly with the rise of speculation regarding their origins and nature.</p>

<p>Previous claims, including those from Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggesting extraterrestrial origins, have been strongly rejected by the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The comet is expected to continue moving away from the solar system, with the final livestream event providing one last chance for observers to engage with this rare celestial phenomenon before it disappears forever.</p>
