      <h2>Alien or Anomaly? Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Races Toward Jupiter With Unexplained Energy</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is racing toward Jupiter, exhibiting behaviour that challenges conventional cometary physics. The object, classified as a comet by NASA, was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile on 1 July 2025. It is expected to make its closest approach to Jupiter on 16 March 2026.</p>

<p>Scientists are closely examining 3I/ATLAS as it displays unusual activity and chemical signatures. The object’s unique characteristics have sparked intense debate among researchers about its origins and implications for stellar science. As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, it presents a significant opportunity for researchers to study its interactions with the giant planet's gravity and environment.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July 2025, in Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter: 16 March 2026</li>
    <li>Speed: Exceeds 130,000 miles (209,000 kilometres) per hour</li>
    <li>Unique chemical signatures: High CO2 to water vapour ratio, emissions of nickel and cyanide</li>
    <li>Data collected from: NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, ESA's JUICE mission, James Webb Space Telescope, and ground-based telescopes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by ATLAS in Chile, marking it as the third confirmed interstellar object. Subsequent observations from various space agencies have revealed its unique characteristics, including a high speed and unusual chemical makeup. By December 2025, new images from the Hubble Space Telescope indicated complex jet structures and dynamic behaviour as the comet approached Jupiter's orbit.</p>

<p>Researchers have recorded observations of the object between July and September 2025, noting its outgassing activity and the presence of rare chemical signatures. As the comet continues its journey, it will provide further opportunities for study by NASA’s Juno spacecraft and other observatories.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS presents an unparalleled chance to study material formed outside our own star system,” said Tom Statler, lead scientist for small bodies at NASA, during a briefing on images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and ESA's JUICE mission.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its discovery has prompted discussions regarding the nature of interstellar visitors and their implications for our understanding of cometary behaviour. While most research continues to support a natural origin for the object, alternative theories have emerged, including those proposed by notable astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who has raised questions about certain characteristics of the comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, researchers plan to utilize instruments on NASA's Juno spacecraft and additional Earth-based telescopes for further observations. The data collected during this phase will help clarify the comet's structure and behaviour, contributing to the understanding of planetary formation and the composition of distant star systems.</p>
