      <h2>Scientists in shock - 3I/Atlas changes again, now with a color never seen before in the solar system</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has undergone a remarkable color transformation, now displaying shades of blue never seen before in our solar system, according to astronomers. The comet, which is on a hyperbolic trajectory and is not bound by the sun's gravity, is currently traveling at over 210,000 km/h as it approaches perihelion on October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing notions about comets and provides insights into the chemical composition of interstellar objects. Scientists are closely monitoring the comet's active coma, which consists of gas and dust surrounding its nucleus, to better understand its unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object recorded in human history.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be over 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>It is currently traveling at more than 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the sun (perihelion) will occur on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Its tail has changed colors from red to green to blue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has undergone multiple color changes since its discovery, starting with red, then transitioning to green, and finally to blue. The blue hue is attributed to the emission of ionized gases rather than the reflection of dust.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches the sun, its nucleus, which contains ice, heats up and becomes increasingly active. This activity has resulted in a bright and dynamic display visible from telescopes around the globe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS is breaking all the rules and notions we had about comets until now,” said an astronomer involved in the study. “The rapid transition of colors suggests that the nucleus is not homogeneous, but rather made up of layers of ice with different volatilities.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS differs significantly from comets originating in our solar system, which typically come from the Oort cloud or the Kuiper belt. The composition of these native comets is influenced by the conditions of our sun, whereas 3I/ATLAS formed in a different solar system with unique metallicity and temperature conditions.</p>

<p>This comet provides scientists with a rare opportunity to analyze a chemical sample from another star system, which has proven to be highly valuable for contemporary astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion in 2025, gathering more data on its chemical composition and behavior. This ongoing research aims to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and the formation of comets.</p>
