      <h2>NASA releases detailed image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS near Mars</h2>

<p>NASA has released new observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed closest to Mars on October 4, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>This latest data is significant for researchers studying interstellar objects. The team from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission has mapped hydrogen and hydroxyl around the comet, enhancing the understanding of its composition and behavior. Observations from the Perseverance rover also contributed to the findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to Mars on October 4, 2023.</li>
    <li>It is currently about 190 million miles (305 million kilometres) from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach its closest point to Earth in mid-December at 167 million miles (268 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>MAVEN's deputy principal investigator is Justin Deighan.</li>
    <li>Perseverance attempted observations of the comet during its closest approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 4, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars. During this time, the MAVEN team successfully mapped hydrogen and hydroxyl around the comet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Perseverance rover conducted its own observation using a long exposure technique to capture the comet's movement against the backdrop of stars.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to continue moving deeper into the inner solar system before returning to interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every measurement we make of this comet helps to open up a new understanding of interstellar objects,” said Justin Deighan, MAVEN’s deputy principal investigator.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is one of the few known interstellar objects that have been observed passing through our solar system. Previous studies of interstellar comets have provided insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers on Earth will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth in December and prepares to return to interstellar space.</p>
