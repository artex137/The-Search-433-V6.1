      <h2>NASA intensifies surveillance of comet 3I/ATLAS after detection of mysterious radio signals</h2>

<p>The international astronomical community is on high alert following the detection of unusual radio signals from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, first identified on July 1, 2025. NASA has intensified its planetary defense protocols to monitor the comet, which poses no risk of collision with Earth.</p>

<p>This heightened surveillance is significant because it presents a rare scientific opportunity to study the comet’s composition and origin. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its high-speed trajectory and radio emissions, have prompted collaboration among global space agencies to gather data throughout its journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It travels at an estimated speed of over 100,000 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 27 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>NASA's planetary defense protocols have been activated in response to the radio signals detected.</li>
    <li>The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected the signals on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>The signals were found to be consistent with hydrogen emissions.</li>
    <li>The comet's core measures between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, NASA activated its planetary defense protocols due to the comet's unique characteristics. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected unusual radio signals from 3I/ATLAS, raising interest among researchers. The closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The interaction of the comet’s material with the solar wind is generating these emissions,” said a NASA spokesperson. “However, the strength of the signal suggests a composition or state of activity much more intense than expected.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed by humanity, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet's unique properties and its passage through our solar system provide critical insights into the formation of planetary systems. Its study will contribute to a better understanding of similar objects and enhance planetary defense strategies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS with advanced telescopes and instruments to gather more data. A press conference is scheduled for August 2025 to present findings and outline the next steps in the observation campaign.</p>
