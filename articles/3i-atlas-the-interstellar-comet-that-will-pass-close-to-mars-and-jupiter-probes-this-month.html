      <h2>3I/ATLAS: The Interstellar Comet That Will Pass Close to Mars and Jupiter Probes This Month</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently passing through our solar system and will come close to Mars and several NASA and ESA spacecraft in early October 2025. The comet, first detected in July 2025, is the third known interstellar object to traverse our solar system and presents a unique opportunity for scientific study.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it allows scientists to gather real-time data about the comet's composition and behavior as it approaches the Sun. The European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA missions are preparing to collect critical observations that could enhance our understanding of interstellar comets and their formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest distance between the comet and Mars will be approximately 30 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet speed is estimated at 130,000 mph (219,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will observe the comet.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Psyche mission will also observe 3I/ATLAS during its journey.</li>
    <li>JUICE will study the comet during its perihelion, when it is closest to the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile in July 2025. As it nears the Sun in October 2025, ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will begin observations from October 1 to 7. The closest approach occurs on October 3, when the comet will be approximately 30 million kilometers from Mars.</p>

<p>During this time, the European Space Agency’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will gather data as the comet reaches its perihelion, creating a tail of gas and dust due to solar heating.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Between 1 and 7 October, our Mars orbiters Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will observe the comet as it passes close to Mars,” said ESA in a statement. “The closest distance between the spacecraft and the comet being 30 million km on 3 October.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“JUICE will be in the best position for the important period around the 3I/ATLAS perihelion, when observations from Earth will be the hardest,” stated T. Marshall Eubanks, Chief Scientist at Space Initiatives Inc.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS carry valuable information about the conditions in other star systems. Their unique trajectories challenge existing theories of comet formation and evolution. Previous encounters with interstellar objects have provided limited data, making this observation a significant advancement in space science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the close approach, scientists will analyze the data collected by the Mars orbiters and JUICE to better understand the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS. This analysis will contribute to ongoing research into the origins of comets and their role in the solar system.</p>
