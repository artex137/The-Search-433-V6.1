      <h2>What Barack Obama said about UFO files that made Donald Trump say 'he made a big mistake'</h2>

<p>Unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have returned to the forefront of American discourse following recent statements from former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump. In a podcast earlier this week, Obama acknowledged the existence of UFOs, while Trump announced plans to release government files related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This renewed interest in UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) has prompted the U.S. government to consider transparency regarding its investigations. Authorities are now focused on addressing public curiosity and potential national security concerns surrounding these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Obama spoke about UFOs in a podcast hosted by Brian Tyler Cohen.</li>
<li>Trump announced his directive to release UFO-related data on social media.</li>
<li>The Pentagon confirmed an 18-page unclassified report on UAPs in June 2024.</li>
<li>Service members reported 485 cases of unidentified phenomena in one year.</li>
<li>118 of these cases were identified as prosaic objects, such as balloons and birds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2024, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released an unclassified report confirming the reality of UAPs but stating there is no evidence linking them to extraterrestrial life. Later, in a podcast, Obama remarked on the existence of UFOs, stating, "They're real, but I haven't seen them." Following this, Trump announced his intention to release files related to UFOs, citing "tremendous interest" from the public.</p>

<p>Trump criticized Obama for allegedly sharing classified information, saying, "he made a big mistake," although he did not specify which remarks were classified. Obama later clarified that he had not seen evidence of contact with aliens but acknowledged the possibility of extraterrestrial life given the vastness of the universe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life,” Trump stated in his social media post.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Obama said, “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Trump remarked, “He [Obama] gave reporters classified information, he is not supposed to be doing that.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFOs have been a topic of congressional discussion for years, primarily due to bipartisan concerns regarding transparency and national security. A series of hearings took place from 2022 to 2024 to investigate UAPs. The Pentagon has consistently stated there is no evidence of alien technology or secret programs related to UAPs.</p>

<p>Past investigations have revealed that many sightings from the 1950s and '60s were likely caused by tests of advanced U.S. spy planes. The government has aimed to publicize its studies of UAPs to address public interest and potential security implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations into UAPs continue, the government will work to identify and release the relevant files as directed by Trump. The timeline for the release of these documents remains unclear.</p>
