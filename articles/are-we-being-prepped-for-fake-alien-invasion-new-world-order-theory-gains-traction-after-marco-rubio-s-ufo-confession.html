      <h2>Are We Being Prepped for 'Fake' Alien Invasion? New World Order Theory Gains Traction After Marco Rubio's UFO Confession</h2>

<p>A new conspiracy theory regarding a potential fake alien invasion has gained traction following recent admissions from U.S. officials about encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). The documentary, <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, set to stream on Prime Video on 21 November, claims to expose an 80-year cover-up of non-human intelligent life.</p>

<p>This revelation raises questions about the motivations behind such disclosures. Analysts suggest that these admissions may align with a broader shift towards authoritarian governance, potentially using a staged alien threat to consolidate power and control over the population.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> will be available on Prime Video on 21 November.</li>
    <li>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has confirmed incidents of unidentified objects over restricted nuclear facilities.</li>
    <li>Congressman André Carson has stated that these objects display otherworldly manoeuvres.</li>
    <li>Jay Stratton, former head of the UAP Task Force, claims to have seen non-human craft and beings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent discussions about UAPs have intensified, with officials making public statements regarding their encounters.</p>
<p>The documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> is set for release on 21 November, aiming to bring the topic into mainstream conversation.</p>
<p>Officials like Marco Rubio and André Carson have provided significant testimonies that challenge the long-held secrecy surrounding these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We’ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities—and it’s not ours.” 
    <strong>— Marco Rubio, U.S. Secretary of State</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “These are otherworldly things that are performing manoeuvres that haven’t been seen.” 
    <strong>— André Carson, Congressman</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings.” 
    <strong>— Jay Stratton, former head of UAP Task Force</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussions surrounding UAPs have evolved from fringe theories to mainstream dialogue, particularly as political climates shift globally. Analysts argue that the rise of far-right parties and the erosion of democratic norms may be setting the stage for more authoritarian governance.</p>
<p>The concept of a staged alien invasion as a means of consolidating power is not new, but recent disclosures have prompted renewed interest in this theory.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the documentary approaches its release date, further investigations into UAPs and official responses are expected. The implications of these revelations on public perception and policy are yet to be fully understood.</p>
