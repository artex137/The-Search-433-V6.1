      <h2>Elon Musk warns of potential comet impact</h2>
<p>Elon Musk has stated that the comet 3I/ATLAS could cause catastrophic damage if it were to collide with Earth, during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Musk emphasized that this scenario is hypothetical, as the comet is not currently on a collision course with our planet.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>Despite not posing an immediate threat, Musk's comments have sparked discussions among astronomers and enthusiasts about the implications of such an impact. The comet, discovered earlier this year, is significant due to its size and unusual composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third-largest interstellar object observed from Earth.</li>
    <li>It was detected in Chile by the ATLAS observation system.</li>
    <li>The comet passed its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at a distance of approximately <strong>210 million kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>Its next closest approach will be on December 19, 2025, at about <strong>270 million kilometers</strong> from Earth.</li>
    <li>The size of 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between <strong>400 meters</strong> and over <strong>5 kilometers</strong> in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The following key events outline the discovery and trajectory of comet 3I/ATLAS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Early 2023: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered.</li>
    <li>October 30, 2025: The comet reaches its closest point to the Sun at approximately <strong>210 million kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>December 19, 2025: The comet will pass Earth at about <strong>270 million kilometers</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “An object like that could wipe out a continent or cause catastrophic damage,” Musk stated during the podcast.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We still do not know its total size, and it is not on a collision course with our planet,” Musk clarified, aiming to ease concerns.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the notable interstellar objects ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Its unusual high concentration of nickel has led to speculation about its origins. Scientists are studying its composition to gain insights into materials that form beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to study the composition of 3I/ATLAS during its passage. Researchers view this as a unique opportunity to learn more about the universe and the potential hazards it may pose to Earth.</p>
