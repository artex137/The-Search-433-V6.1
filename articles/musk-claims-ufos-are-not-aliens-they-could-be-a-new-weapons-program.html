      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-12 11:28 UTC</p>

      <h2>Musk Claims UFOs Are Not Aliens: They Could Be A 'New Weapons Program'</h2>

<p>Elon Musk has stated that he does not believe UFOs are evidence of extraterrestrial life, suggesting instead that they may be advanced military technology developed by governments. Musk made these comments during a recent appearance on Katie Miller's podcast, where he discussed the implications of UFO sightings on Earth.</p>

<p>This statement is significant as Musk is a leading figure in space exploration, heading SpaceX, which has conducted more civilian space launches than any other company. His insights could influence public perception and understanding of UFOs and their potential origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Elon Musk appeared on Katie Miller's podcast recently.</li>
    <li>Musk has claimed he has seen no evidence of aliens.</li>
    <li>He questioned SpaceX senior staff about evidence of extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>Musk suggested UFOs may be advanced military prototypes, not alien spacecraft.</li>
    <li>He aims to establish a self-sustaining city on Mars within 20 to 30 years.</li>
    <li>The timeline for an unmanned Starship mission to Mars is targeted for 2028.</li>
    <li>Human missions to Mars are projected to start around 2030, subject to engineering challenges.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During his podcast appearance, Musk reiterated his long-standing belief that there is no credible evidence of alien life. He has previously made similar claims in interviews, including one with Joe Rogan, where he promised to disclose any evidence of aliens if it came to him. Musk has also focused on developing Mars as a viable second home for humanity, with ambitious timelines for manned missions.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Musk stated that a self-sustaining city on Mars could be established in two decades, and he has outlined a cautious approach to the timelines for SpaceX's missions to the Red Planet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I have seen no evidence of aliens,” Musk told Miller, emphasizing that his team at SpaceX has also found no evidence of extraterrestrial life.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “UFOs... it could be like a new weapons programme... or hypersonic missiles. It's just basically a weapons prototype. It's not aliens,” he added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Musk's skepticism about alien life contrasts with the growing interest in UFOs, especially following recent government disclosures regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. Despite public fascination with the idea of extraterrestrial visitors, Musk's focus remains on human expansion into space and the potential risks associated with remaining solely on Earth.</p>

<p>His plans for Mars colonization have sparked debate within the scientific community, with concerns raised about the potential consequences for human evolution in a Martian environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Musk continues to push forward with plans for Mars colonization while maintaining a clear stance against the belief in extraterrestrial life. Upcoming missions and technological advancements will be closely monitored as SpaceX works towards its ambitious goals in space exploration.</p>
