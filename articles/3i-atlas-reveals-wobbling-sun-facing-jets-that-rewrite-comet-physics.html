      <h2>3I/ATLAS Reveals Wobbling Sun-Facing Jets That Rewrite Comet Physics</h2>

<p>Researchers have discovered unusual jet-like structures in the comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels toward the Sun, with observations made at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife between July 2 and September 5, 2025. The findings challenge existing theories about comet behavior, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it could change how scientists classify interstellar objects. 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed entering the solar system, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Authorities, including NASA and ESA, are now reviewing the data for implications on planetary defense strategies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently approaching perihelion.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted over thirty-seven nights from July 2 to September 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>Jets formed within the comet's sun-facing anti-tail extend nearly one million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The jets oscillate every seven hours and forty-five minutes.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA, ESA, and JPL are involved in monitoring and analyzing the comet's behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 2, 2025, researchers began a multi-night observational campaign of 3I/ATLAS at the Teide Observatory. By August 3, distinct jet formations were observed, which continued to develop through August 29. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and is now on its outbound trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“In reviewing the image sequences, the most striking feature is the persistence of structure,” said a team researcher. “What is seen here instead is directional stability combined with rhythmic motion.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the interstellar objects ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov presented unique challenges to existing astronomical models. Each object exhibited behaviors that differed from typical solar system bodies, prompting a reevaluation of comet classification.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS to better understand its structure and behavior. The findings may inform future studies of interstellar objects and their potential impact on solar system dynamics.</p>
