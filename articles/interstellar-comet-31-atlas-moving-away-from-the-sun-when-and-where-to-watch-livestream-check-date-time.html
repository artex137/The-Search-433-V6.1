      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS moving away from the Sun: When and where to watch livestream? Check date, time</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed moving away from the Sun and will be livestreamed tonight at 11:15 pm ET. The comet, which is approximately the size of Manhattan, is currently travelling through the constellation Virgo, according to reports from Space.com.</p>

<p>This event has generated significant interest among scientists and the public. The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a real-time view of the comet, which is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. NASA is also expected to release high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS within days, following a delay caused by a recent government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Livestream Start Time:</strong> 11:15 pm ET, tonight</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> +10.9 (not visible to the naked eye)</li>
    <li><strong>Image Release:</strong> Expected within days from NASA</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> Occurred last month</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered four months ago. Since then, various theories about its nature have emerged, particularly following its close approach to several planets, including Jupiter, Venus, and Mars.</p>
<p>In early October, images of the comet were captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera. However, their release was delayed due to a government shutdown that ended last week.</p>
<p>Tonight, the Virtual Telescope Project will begin its livestream of the comet at 11:15 pm ET, allowing viewers from around the world to observe this cosmic event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Science should have been prioritized over bureaucracy,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, commenting on the delay of the image release.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to enter our solar system, following Oumuamua and Borisov. Its discovery has prompted considerable speculation about its origin and nature, with some, including Elon Musk, expressing concerns about its potential impact on Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is set to release the high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS as early as next week. The livestream event tonight will provide an opportunity for the public to engage with this astronomical phenomenon while awaiting further scientific data.</p>
