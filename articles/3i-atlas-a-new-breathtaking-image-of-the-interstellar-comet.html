      <h2>3i/Atlas: A New Breathtaking Image of the Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>A group of astronomers and students has captured a new image of the interstellar comet 3i/Atlas at the Gemini South telescope in Chile on August 27, 2025. The image reveals a prominent tail and a bright hair, features that had never been observed before.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides valuable scientific data on the composition of this rare cosmic visitor. The observations were part of a special National Science Foundation (NSF) Noirlab program designed to engage the public in astronomical research. Students from Hawaii, La Serena, and various locations worldwide participated via Zoom, interacting with scientists and learning about the science of comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of observation:</strong> August 27, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Gemini South telescope, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Altitude:</strong> 2,722 meters above sea level</li>
    <li><strong>Participants:</strong> Astronomers and students from various regions</li>
    <li><strong>Next observation:</strong> Scheduled for November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Comet's closest point to the sun:</strong> October 29-30, 2025, at about 1.4 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 2025, at 270 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3i/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Atlas surveillance system. The recent observations on August 27 marked a milestone as astronomers and students witnessed the comet's tail live, indicating its entry into a more active phase.</p>
<p>A second public observation is planned for November 2025 when 3i/Atlas re-emerges from behind the sun, with the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii set to lead the observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The purpose of observation was to analyze the colors of the comet and obtain ghosts for a direct measurement of chemistry,” said astronomer Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii. “We were excited to see the growth of the tail together with the students, which indicates a change in the particles issued with respect to the previous images and we had our first taste of its chemistry.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Scientist Bryce Bolin from Eureka Scientific noted, “Each interstellar comet is a messenger of another star system. Studying light and color, we begin to understand the diversity of worlds beyond ours.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3i/Atlas is only the third interstellar object identified, following ʻoumuamua in 2017 and 2i/Borisov in 2019. Unlike local comets, its hyperbolic orbit will return it to interstellar space, marking a unique scientific opportunity.</p>
<p>Previous observations have revealed that 3i/Atlas has a high carbon dioxide to water ratio, significant water production, and a unique chemical composition compared to other comets in our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The comet will reach its closest point to the sun on October 29-30, 2025. The public will have another opportunity to observe 3i/Atlas in November 2025 as it re-emerges from behind the sun, providing further insights into its characteristics and behavior.</p>
