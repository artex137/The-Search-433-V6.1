      <h2>3I/ATLAS Data 'Hidden' Since October? NASA to Finally Brief Rep. Anna Paulina Luna</h2>

<p>A mysterious comet, 3I/ATLAS, has prompted a formal inquiry from US Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) regarding unreleased data from NASA. The request follows unusual characteristics exhibited by the comet as it passed through the solar system. Luna's letter to NASA's acting administrator Sean Duffy has escalated the issue to Capitol Hill, where the agency is expected to provide a briefing on the matter.</p>

<p>This inquiry highlights ongoing concerns about NASA's transparency regarding interstellar objects. As the comet's peculiar behavior raises questions, Luna has emphasized the importance of the data in understanding such celestial visitors and their interactions with our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object in question: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Representative: Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL)</li>
    <li>NASA's acting administrator: Sean Duffy</li>
    <li>Date of inquiry: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Request for data: HiRISE images from 2-3 October</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: Approximately 30 million kilometers (18.6 million miles)</li>
    <li>Current status: NASA has agreed to a formal briefing for Rep. Luna</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual behavior, including signs of 'non-gravitational acceleration' and a color 'bluer than the sun.' These observations led scientist Avi Loeb to suggest that the comet might be propelled by an alien craft, which has sparked public interest and skepticism among scientists.</p>

<p>On 2 October, the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS. However, these images have not been publicly released, prompting Luna's formal request for transparency.</p>

<p>Following Luna's inquiry, NASA has confirmed plans for a briefing to address the concerns raised by the congresswoman and the scientific community. A date for the briefing has not yet been set.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I write to request the release of specific observational data related to 3I/ATLAS... This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system.”</blockquote> 
<blockquote>“Great question! @NASA's observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth.”</blockquote> 
<blockquote>“We all owe a debt of deep gratitude for the visionary support displayed by Representative Luna to frontier science through her letter.”</blockquote> 

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The inquiry into 3I/ATLAS reflects broader concerns about NASA's handling of data related to interstellar objects. Previous incidents have raised questions about transparency and the agency's communication with both the public and scientific community.</p>

<p>The public interest in 3I/ATLAS has been heightened by speculation regarding its origins and characteristics, leading to calls for more open dialogue between NASA and lawmakers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to hold a formal briefing for Rep. Luna and her staff regarding the data and images related to 3I/ATLAS. The date for this briefing has not been announced, but it aims to address the concerns surrounding the unreleased images and the comet's unusual behavior.</p>
