      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS intrigues NASA with inverted tail and unprecedented chemical composition in 2025</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention from astronomers after an anomaly was detected on November 5, 2025. The comet, which travels through the Solar System, exhibited a rare antitail structure before transitioning to a conventional ion tail, prompting investigations by observatories worldwide.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it challenges existing models of celestial bodies originating from other stars. NASA and other space agencies are conducting continuous observations and analyses to understand the comet's unique characteristics and behavior, which deviate from typical cometary patterns.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass at a safe distance of 270 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of 58 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>The comet contains a unique chemical composition, dominated by carbon dioxide over water.</li>
    <li>It will approach Jupiter at a distance of 50 million kilometers in March 2026.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS lost about 13% of its mass during its perihelion passage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025. Observations began immediately, revealing a sharp hyperbolic trajectory indicating its interstellar origin. On October 29, the comet reached perihelion, where it exhibited a unique antitail structure. This structure disappeared on November 5, giving way to a conventional ion tail.</p>
<p>Between September and October, probes SOHO and STEREO-A recorded significant data about the comet's behavior. By November 11, the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands captured intense bluish tones from the comet.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to approach Jupiter in March 2026, which could significantly alter its trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is extremely difficult to model with current theories,” said Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University. “This forces research teams to rethink hypotheses about the ejection of objects from their home stellar systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS add to the ongoing study of interstellar objects, following the previous encounters with ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The extreme polarization of light reflected by the comet's dust suggests a unique alignment of particles that has not been observed in other comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026. This encounter is anticipated to provide further insights into the comet's trajectory and chemical composition.</p>
