      <h2>Hubble Detects 3I/ATLAS Nucleus With Km Cross-Section, Revealing Cometary Size</h2>

<p>Scientists have directly detected the nucleus of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS using the Hubble Space Telescope, revealing its effective radius to be approximately one kilometre. The observations were made by a team including Man-To Hui from the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and David Jewitt from UCLA, among others, and were published recently. This marks the first time researchers have identified the solid core of such a rare cosmic object.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides new insights into the composition and behaviour of interstellar objects, which are infrequently observed. The findings may suggest that many similar objects exist within our solar system, potentially undetected. The team’s research has overcome previous challenges that obscured the nucleus from earlier observations, offering a clearer understanding of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Nucleus Effective Radius:</strong> Approximately 1 km</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Date:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Research Team:</strong> Man-To Hui, David Jewitt, Max J. Mutchler, Jessica Agarwal, Yoonyoung Kim et al.</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Observations:</strong> Hubble Space Telescope (HST)</li>
    <li><strong>Publication:</strong> Recent publication detailing findings</li>
    <li><strong>Activity Index:</strong> 4.5 ±0.3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The research team utilized the Hubble Space Telescope to observe 3I/ATLAS, focusing on its nucleus and post-perihelion activity. They collected multiple exposures while tracking the object’s position, applying rigorous data reduction techniques to ensure accurate measurements. The team successfully isolated the nucleus, revealing its size and shape, and conducted analyses that suggest the object may be more common than previously believed.</p>

<p>Through their observations, the team identified distinct photometric variations that indicate the nucleus is likely aspherical, with a rotation period exceeding one hour. They also noted that 3I/ATLAS faded more rapidly after its perihelion, further supporting the idea of a change in outgassing behaviour as it moved away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This discovery establishes that multiple interstellar objects resembling 3I/ATLAS likely went undetected even before the discovery of 1I/‘Oumuamua,” said David Jewitt from UCLA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects. Prior to this, the only known interstellar object was 1I/‘Oumuamua, discovered in 2017. The findings from 3I/ATLAS suggest that there may be a larger population of these cosmic wanderers in our solar system than previously thought.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue investigating the characteristics and behaviour of 3I/ATLAS and similar objects to enhance understanding of their origins and prevalence in the solar system. Future observations may further clarify the dynamics of these interstellar visitors.</p>
