      <h2>Watch interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS make its closest approach to Earth in free livestream on Dec. 18</h2>

<p>Skywatchers can observe interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it makes its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023. The Virtual Telescope Project will host a free livestream of the event starting at 11 p.m. EST on December 18 (0400 GMT on December 19) from Manciano, Italy, weather permitting.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system. Astronomers are keen to study its composition and behavior, which may provide insights into the formation of planetary systems around other stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date and Time:</strong> Livestream starts at 11 p.m. EST on December 18 (0400 GMT on December 19).</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS will be closest to Earth at 1 a.m. EST on December 19 (0600 GMT).</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) from Earth.</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey.</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> The comet is too faint for the naked eye and requires a telescope of 8 inches or larger to view.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey. It has since become a focal point for astronomers and the public alike. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth at 1 a.m. EST on December 19, 2023.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2023, at 11 p.m. EST, the Virtual Telescope Project will begin its livestream, allowing viewers to watch the comet in real-time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Researchers are especially interested in its composition and behavior, which could offer rare clues about how planetary systems form around other stars,” said a representative from the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object in our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its discovery has reignited interest in the study of interstellar objects and their potential to inform our understanding of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers can expect to see the comet during its closest approach, with opportunities for further study and analysis following the event. The livestream will provide a unique chance for those unable to observe the comet in person to participate in this rare cosmic encounter.</p>
