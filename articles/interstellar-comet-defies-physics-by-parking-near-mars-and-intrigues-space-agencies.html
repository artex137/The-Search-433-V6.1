      <h2>Interstellar comet defies physics by parking near Mars and intrigues space agencies</h2>

<p>Space agencies worldwide are investigating unusual orbital behavior of the interstellar object 3I/Atlas, which interrupted its movement near Mars in October 2025. The comet, traveling at an average speed of 210,000 kilometers per hour, became static relative to background stars, a phenomenon that challenges existing celestial mechanics.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it requires a reevaluation of orbital simulation software and theories regarding the movement of celestial bodies. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are analyzing data collected during this period to understand the implications of such behavior on future astronomical studies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Initial identification: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars during anomaly: approximately 27 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed prior to immobility: 210,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Estimated core size: between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Next close approach: Jupiter on March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: more than 260 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/Atlas was first detected on July 1, 2025, by telescopes in Chile, confirming its interstellar origin. The following day, observatories in Arizona and Hawaii corroborated its trajectory.</p>
<p>In October 2025, during its approach to Mars, the comet exhibited a unique behavior by becoming temporarily stationary, prompting immediate investigations by NASA and ESA.</p>
<p>After resuming its trajectory, 3I/Atlas is projected to pass Jupiter on March 16, 2026, where further observations will take place.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The immobility of 3I/Atlas required an immediate overhaul of our orbital simulation models,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This unprecedented behavior challenges our understanding of celestial mechanics.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unusual behavior has prompted astronomers to consider non-gravitational forces in their predictive models, a significant shift in how such celestial bodies are understood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the unique properties of 3I/Atlas will continue, particularly regarding its interaction with solar magnetic fields and gaseous emissions. Upcoming missions, including ESA’s Juice, will monitor the comet during its passage near Jupiter.</p>
