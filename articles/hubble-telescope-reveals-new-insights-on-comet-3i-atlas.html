      <h2>Hubble Telescope Reveals New Insights on Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has provided new insights into the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is nearing Earth this December. The comet is traveling at a speed of 220,000 kilometres per hour and was first detected in July 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for scientists as it marks 3I/ATLAS as the third object confirmed to originate outside Earth’s solar system. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are actively monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics as it approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First observed: July 2025</li>
    <li>Latest observation: November 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during latest observation: 178 million miles (286 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Speed: 220,000 kilometres per hour</li>
    <li>Projected closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated size of icy nucleus: between 427 metres and 1,100 metres in width</li>
    <li>ESA's Juice orbiter observed the comet from November 2 to 25, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. It gained recognition as an interstellar object shortly thereafter. The Hubble Space Telescope conducted its latest observations on November 30, 2025, when the comet was 178 million miles away from Earth. The ESA's Juice orbiter captured images of the comet between November 2 and 25, 2025, during a period of increased activity following its close approach to the sun on October 30.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no evidence of extraterrestrial life associated with 3I/ATLAS. It is simply a comet,” said NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is noteworthy as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system. Its appearance has sparked various conspiracy theories regarding its nature, including claims that it may be an alien spacecraft. However, experts have largely dismissed these theories in favor of its natural origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists expect to receive further observations from the Juice orbiter by February 2026, enhancing understanding of interstellar objects and their implications for our solar system.</p>
