      <h2>Are Aliens Real? Barack Obama Says ‘Yes’, But Denies Area 51 Secrets</h2>

<p>Former US president Barack Obama has stated that he believes extraterrestrial life exists, but he has no evidence to support this claim. In a podcast interview released on Saturday with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cowen, Obama addressed the existence of aliens, saying, “They’re real.” However, he clarified that he has never personally seen any evidence of aliens.</p>

<p>Obama also discussed popular conspiracy theories surrounding Area 51, a highly classified US Air Force base in Groom Lake, Nevada. He stated, “But I haven’t seen them. They’re not being kept at Area 51,” suggesting that if such evidence existed, it would not be concealed from the President of the United States. His remarks have reignited public interest in the topic of extraterrestrial life and government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
