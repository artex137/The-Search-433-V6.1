      <h2>Trajectory models show 3I/ATLAS nearing Jupiter’s irregular moon Eupheme in March 2026</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is on track to pass close to Jupiter’s irregular moon Eupheme on March 17, 2026, after flying past Earth in December 2025, according to trajectory models. The comet will be approximately 30.46 million kilometers from Eupheme at its closest approach.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant as it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study the gravitational interactions between the comet and Jupiter. Researchers are particularly interested in the potential for smaller fragments of the comet to be captured into Jupiter’s orbit due to the planet's strong gravitational pull.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Closest approach to Eupheme: March 17, 2026</li>
  <li>Distance from Eupheme during closest approach: 30.46 million kilometers</li>
  <li>Distance from Jupiter on March 16, 2026: 53.61 million kilometers</li>
  <li>Speed at closest approach: approximately 66 kilometers per second</li>
  <li>Eupheme's orbital period: 588 days</li>
  <li>Discovery of Eupheme: 2003</li>
  <li>Estimated size of Eupheme: approximately 2 kilometers wide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has traveled through the Oort Cloud for 8,000 years and is now on its outbound journey from the Sun. It is expected to make its closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, before nearing Eupheme the following day. Eupheme will reach its farthest point from Jupiter on January 23, 2026, at a distance of 27.7 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, noted, “These small objects can become gravitationally bound to Jupiter as long as they receive a kick that cancels the relative motion between 3I/ATLAS and Jupiter.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb added, “This is because a break-up of a natural astrophysical object which is much less massive than Jupiter cannot result in a velocity kick as high as 66 kilometers per second.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Eupheme is part of the Ananke group of moons that orbit Jupiter and is believed to have formed from a larger object that collided with another. These moons follow elliptical orbits that are not aligned with Jupiter's equator, indicating they originated from an external source rather than formed from Jupiter itself.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Juno spacecraft will monitor the close encounter between 3I/ATLAS and Jupiter, and researchers will analyze data from the event to gain insights into the comet’s origin and the dynamics of celestial interactions.</p>
