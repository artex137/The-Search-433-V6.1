      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Erupts with Cryovolcanoes</h2>
<p>A series of cryovolcanoes have erupted on the surface of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, according to a preliminary study led by Josep Trigo-Rodríguez at the Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC/IEEC) in Spain. The study suggests that these eruptions may be linked to the corrosion of material within the comet's core. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the comet's structure and behavior. The findings, which have not yet been peer-reviewed, indicate that comet 3I/ATLAS may share characteristics with icy trans-Neptunian objects, which include dwarf planets and other celestial bodies in the outer solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently approaching the sun.</li>
    <li>Research led by Josep Trigo-Rodríguez at the Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC/IEEC) in Spain.</li>
    <li>Cryovolcano eruptions have been observed on the comet's surface.</li>
    <li>The study's findings have not yet been peer-reviewed.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS may be covered in multiple cryovolcanoes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent observations have revealed the activity of cryovolcanoes on comet 3I/ATLAS. Josep Trigo-Rodríguez and his team have conducted a preliminary study, indicating that these eruptions are likely caused by the corrosion of material within the comet's core. The study underscores the comet's potential similarity to icy trans-Neptunian objects.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches the sun, researchers continue to monitor its behavior and gather data to better understand its structure and activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This preliminary research suggests that comet 3I/ATLAS is similar to icy trans-Neptunian objects,” said Josep Trigo-Rodríguez, the leading researcher in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of cryovolcanoes on comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing body of research into the characteristics of comets and their behavior as they approach the sun. Previous studies have often focused on the composition and structure of these celestial bodies, but the identification of cryovolcanoes adds a new dimension to our understanding of cometary activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further observations and analyses to confirm their findings and explore the implications for our understanding of cometary behavior and the solar system. The study will undergo peer review to validate the results and expand on the preliminary findings.</p>
