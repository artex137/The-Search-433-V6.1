      <h2>Nasa’s Parker Solar Probe Sees Beyond the Sun to Capture Rare Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Nasa’s Parker Solar Probe has captured unprecedented images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, an object from outside our solar system, between October 18 and November 5, 2025. The probe's observations provide a unique opportunity to study a comet that could not be viewed from Earth due to its proximity to the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances our understanding of interstellar phenomena. According to NASA, the findings from the Parker Solar Probe’s observations could shed light on the composition, trajectory, and behavior of interstellar comets, enriching the field of heliophysics and interstellar research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The Parker Solar Probe captured around 10 images of the comet each day during its observations.</li>
    <li>At the time of observation, the comet was approximately 130 million miles from the Sun, just beyond Mars' orbit.</li>
    <li>Other NASA missions, including PUNCH, STEREO, and SOHO, also tracked Comet 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The observations were conducted using the WISPR instrument aboard the Parker Solar Probe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, the Parker Solar Probe conducted observations of the comet from October 18 to November 5, 2025. These observations provided critical data during a key period when the comet was near its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>The Parker Solar Probe, during its 25th solar flyby, utilized its unique orbit to capture images that would have been impossible to obtain from Earth, as the comet was aligned with the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The innovative use of the Parker Solar Probe for this purpose is a significant achievement in the field of heliophysics,” according to NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. The study of such interstellar visitors provides insights into the materials and conditions present in other star systems, which may differ from those in our own solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the data from the Parker Solar Probe is processed, researchers will continue to analyze the comet's features and behavior, refining models of interstellar comets and their interactions with the Sun and solar wind.</p>
