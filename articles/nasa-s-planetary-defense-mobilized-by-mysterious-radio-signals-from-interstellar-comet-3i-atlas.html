      <h2>NASA’s planetary defense mobilized by mysterious radio signals from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The global scientific community has heightened its alert status following the detection of anomalous radio signals from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS astronomical survey system in Havaí, the comet is currently being monitored by NASA, which has activated its planetary defense protocols to observe its trajectory and emissions.</p>

<p>This situation is significant because it marks the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system and the first to emit unexplained radio signals. NASA’s Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária (PDCO) has classified the event as high priority, although 3I/ATLAS does not currently pose a threat to Earth. Authorities aim to study the comet while ensuring that any potential deviations in its course are detected early.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, at Havaí.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at a speed exceeding 100,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has an estimated diameter between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Radio signals were detected on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT radio telescope in África do Sul.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>No risk of impact with Earth has been reported by NASA officials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS astronomical survey system. Following its detection, scientists calculated its hyperbolic trajectory and monitored its rapid movement through the solar system.</p>

<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected anomalous radio signals from the comet, prompting NASA to initiate an extensive observation campaign. This included coordination with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the use of advanced instruments like the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile and the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

<p>The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, with ongoing monitoring to refine predictions of its trajectory and study its emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unusual nature of the signals requires a maximum level of vigilance,” said a NASA official, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This event serves as a real-time test for the international planetary defense network,” stated another representative, highlighting the collaboration between NASA, ESA, and global observatories.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, two other interstellar objects, ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have been identified. However, these objects did not exhibit the same enigmatic behavior as 3I/ATLAS. The peculiar radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS have led scientists to explore various hypotheses regarding its origin and composition.</p>

<p>This discovery has prompted a reevaluation of what is known about cometary activity, particularly those from extrasolar sources, and has opened new avenues for research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue their coordinated observation efforts to gather data on 3I/ATLAS. Researchers aim to analyze its composition and track any changes in its trajectory as it approaches the Sun.</p>
