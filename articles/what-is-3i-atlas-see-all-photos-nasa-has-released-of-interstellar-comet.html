      <h2>NASA Releases New Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS, originating from outside our solar system, is passing through our cosmic neighborhood. NASA has released new images of the comet, which is being studied by astronomers worldwide. The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing at a safe distance of about 170 million miles (274 million kilometers) away.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its rarity as only the third comet confirmed to have originated from outside the solar system. Astronomers and space agencies are racing to study the comet, which is composed of planetary material formed from another star. The recent release of images by NASA has generated considerable interest in the scientific community and among the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 170 million miles (274 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Speed at discovery: 137,000 miles per hour (220,000 kilometers per hour)</li>
    <li>Estimated size: 1,400 feet to 3.5 miles (approximately 427 meters to 5.6 kilometers)</li>
    <li>Initial discovery: July 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025, when it was confirmed to be the third object identified as originating from outside Earth's solar system. At the time, it was traveling at approximately 137,000 miles per hour (220,000 kilometers per hour). Since its discovery, astronomers have been monitoring its trajectory and speed, confirming its interstellar origin.</p>

<p>NASA released a new batch of images of the comet on November 19, 2025, unveiling new characteristics of this interstellar object. The release of these images has been highly anticipated by astronomers and space enthusiasts alike.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is a remarkable object that has traveled through space for potentially billions of years before arriving in our solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it joins the ranks of only two other comets confirmed to have originated from outside the solar system. Its journey from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius highlights the vastness of interstellar space and the dynamics of celestial bodies. The comet's hyperbolic orbit indicates that it will eventually exit our solar system and continue its journey through interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to study the comet using ground telescopes and instruments in space. Further analysis of its composition and characteristics is expected to provide insights into the formation of celestial bodies in other star systems.</p>
