      <h2>Over 2,000 UFO sightings reported in first half of 2025</h2>

<p>More than 2,000 UFO sightings have been reported in the first half of 2025, according to data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). The organization has recorded a total of 2,174 sightings from January to June this year.</p>

<p>This significant increase in reports highlights ongoing public interest in unidentified flying objects. NUFORC has noted that many reports stem from years or decades prior, due to the stigma surrounding UFO sightings. The organization aims to investigate these cases, which include reports from citizens, air traffic controllers, police, and military personnel.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2,174 UFO sightings reported from January to June 2025.</li>
    <li>1,492 sightings logged during the same period in 2024.</li>
    <li>2,077 sightings recorded in the first half of 2023.</li>
    <li>NUFORC collected over 3,000 reports during the first six months of 2025.</li>
    <li>Approximately 5 percent of actual sightings are reported, according to NUFORC.</li>
    <li>Reports range from detailed descriptions to brief notes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, public interest in UFOs has surged, particularly following whistleblower David Grusch's allegations in 2023 about a secret UFO-retrieval program operated by the Pentagon. His testimony led to congressional hearings and a renewed focus on unexplained sightings.</p>

<p>Since then, additional government insiders have supported Grusch’s claims, asserting that the Defense Department has not been forthcoming about the nature of these sightings. In contrast, the Pentagon has maintained that there is no evidence to suggest that unexplained sightings are extraterrestrial.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There are so many things being seen by so many people. And if it’s a secret block project, you’re not flying it over highly populated neighborhoods where everybody can see it, and even these days, have pictures of it,” said Christian Stepien, NUFORC’s chief technology officer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We get lots of reports of balloons and things like that that we can say that’s clearly a balloon, or that’s a drone, or it’s an airplane or whatever it is,” Stepien added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The increase in reported UFO sightings aligns with a broader trend of heightened scrutiny regarding government transparency on the issue. Lawmakers are advocating for more openness about unexplained aerial phenomena, which they argue could include both human-made and nonhuman technology. Reports have described various shapes of UFOs, including triangles, discs, and orbs, with some exhibiting unusual flight capabilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NUFORC plans to continue its efforts to collect reports of UFO sightings and is advocating for increased transparency from the government regarding data collected through advanced technology. Stepien has emphasized the importance of obtaining high-resolution recordings to further investigate these phenomena.</p>
