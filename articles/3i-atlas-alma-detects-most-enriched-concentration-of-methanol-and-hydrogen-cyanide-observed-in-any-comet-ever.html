      <h2>ALMA Detects Most Enriched Concentration of Methanol and Hydrogen Cyanide in Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) has detected the highest concentrations of methanol (CH₃OH) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) ever observed in a comet, specifically in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The observations were conducted between August 28 and October 1, 2025, according to a report led by Nathan X. Roth and his team.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it adds to the understanding of the chemical composition of comets and their origins. The findings may provide insights into the processes that contribute to the formation of such interstellar objects. Researchers aim to further analyze the implications of these measurements.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observatory: Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA)</li>
    <li>Observation dates: August 28, September 12, 15, 18, 22, and October 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Atacama Desert, Chile</li>
    <li>Lead researcher: Nathan X. Roth</li>
    <li>CH₃OH production rate increased near the inner edge of the H₂O sublimation zone at rH = 2 au</li>
    <li>CH₃OH/HCN ratios: 124 +30 -34 on September 12, and 79 +11 -14 on September 15</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>ALMA conducted a series of observations of comet 3I/ATLAS over several dates in late 2025. The team detected significant concentrations of methanol and hydrogen cyanide, noting a sharp increase in the production rate of methanol from August through October.</p>
<p>On August 28, the initial observations began, followed by further studies on September 12 and 15, where the production rates were measured. Additional observations occurred on September 18, 22, and October 1 to monitor changes in the chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We found in it the most enriched concentrations of CH₃OH and HCN of any comet, second only to C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS),” said the ALMA Observatory in a statement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Methanol is not a definitive biomarker to confirm signs of extraterrestrial life, as it can be a byproduct of abiotic or non-biological processes,” noted Jingcheng Huang and colleagues in their 2022 paper.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery builds on ALMA's previous work in comet studies, which began in 2014, when it released findings on other comets' chemical compositions. The observatory has previously detected other significant compounds, including phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus, which sparked debates about potential biological origins.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object recorded in the solar system, following 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov. The analysis of such objects continues to be a key area of research in astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from the observations of 3I/ATLAS. Further studies may focus on the implications of the detected chemical compositions and their relevance to the understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
