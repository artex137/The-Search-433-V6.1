      <h2>Forget Alien Spacecrafts: Could Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Be A Planet-Forming Seed?</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been identified as a potential planet-forming seed, according to research presented at the Joint Meeting of the Europlanet Science Congress and the American Astronomical Society’s Division for Planetary Science (EPSC-DPS2025) on July 1, 2025. The comet, discovered moving through the Solar System at nearly twice the speed of previous interstellar visitors, has a nucleus estimated at 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) in diameter.</p>

<p>This research may help clarify longstanding mysteries about planet formation in the Solar System. Scientists have suggested that interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS could accelerate the formation of planets, particularly around high-mass stars, by providing ready-made materials that facilitate quicker accretion processes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Nucleus size: Approximately 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles)</li>
    <li>Location: Moving through the Solar System</li>
    <li>Event: Presentation at EPSC-DPS2025</li>
    <li>Researchers: Professor Susanne Pfalzner and Michele Bannister from Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers confirmed the presence of 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar comet moving through the Solar System. The object has garnered attention for its size and speed, surpassing previous interstellar visitors such as ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov.</p>
<p>During the EPSC-DPS2025 meeting, researchers presented findings suggesting that such interstellar objects may contribute to planet formation, addressing challenges in existing models of how planets develop in protoplanetary disks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects may be able to jump start planet formation, in particular around higher-mass stars,” said Professor Susanne Pfalzner during her presentation at EPSC-DPS2025.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Higher-mass stars are more efficient in capturing interstellar objects in their discs,” Pfalzner added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous research has indicated that the formation of large planets poses challenges within the current models of planetary accretion. Issues include the long timescales required for planet formation and the difficulties in the growth of objects larger than one meter (3 feet).</p>
<p>The findings regarding 3I/ATLAS suggest that interstellar objects could provide a solution to these issues, potentially influencing the understanding of gas giants’ rarity around smaller stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further studies on interstellar objects and their role in planetary formation are needed. Researchers aim to incorporate these findings into existing models to better understand the origins of planets in the universe.</p>
