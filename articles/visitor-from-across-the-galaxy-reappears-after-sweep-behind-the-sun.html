      <h2>Visitor from across the galaxy reappears after sweep behind the Sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has reappeared in our solar system after passing behind the Sun, becoming visible from Earth once again. The object, which is only the third known interstellar visitor, was first detected in July 2025 and reached its closest approach to the Sun about a week ago, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>The reappearance of 3I/ATLAS is significant for the scientific community as it provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. The comet is now on a trajectory that will take it back out into the galaxy. Scientists are eager to observe its characteristics and behaviour as it moves further away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025.</li>
  <li>It reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, approximately one week ago.</li>
  <li>Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Lowell Observatory, has been actively observing the comet.</li>
  <li>The comet's coma has become visible again, showing greenish diatomic carbon emission.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. It travelled towards the Sun, reaching its closest approach about a week ago. After this perihelion, the comet has re-emerged from behind the Sun and is now visible from Earth once more.</p>

<p>About five days ago, it became observable again after its passage behind the Sun. Qicheng Zhang shared images captured by the Lowell Observatory, showcasing the comet's coma, which is now visible through small telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object’s coma is once again becoming visible,” said Qicheng Zhang. “We are excited to observe its characteristics as it moves further into the galaxy.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. The previous interstellar visitors have provided valuable insights into the composition and behaviour of such objects, making 3I/ATLAS an important subject for ongoing research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and characteristics. Further observations are expected to provide more data on the comet's composition and behaviour as it travels back into interstellar space.</p>
