      <h2>Dozen such coincidences - Harvard Professor Avi Loeb says 3I/ATLAS and gamma-ray burst alignments are statistically expected</h2>

<p>Harvard Professor Avi Loeb has stated that reported alignments between interstellar object 3I/ATLAS and gamma-ray bursts are statistically expected, based on event rates and the object’s long transit time through the Solar System. His remarks came during a discussion about recent observations of the comet, which took place in 2025.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it sheds light on the nature of astronomical coincidences and the physical conditions of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb’s findings provide a statistical framework for understanding these alignments, which could inform future research in astrophysics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The longest-duration gamma-ray burst, GRB 250702b, was detected on July 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>The angular separation between 3I/ATLAS and GRB 250702b was 17 degrees.</li>
    <li>The probability of this alignment being a chance occurrence is 0.02.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has been traveling through the Solar System for approximately 8,000 years.</li>
    <li>In 2025, about six normal-duration gamma-ray bursts aligned within 17 degrees of 3I/ATLAS's arrival direction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. The following day, the longest-duration gamma-ray burst, GRB 250702b, was detected. Loeb observed that the angular separation between the two was 17 degrees.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2025, post-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS were conducted using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph at the 8.1-meter Gemini North telescope in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The imaging results showed changes in the molecular composition of gas released by 3I/ATLAS as it passed near the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Altogether, there had been a dozen such coincidences while 3I/ATLAS was traveling inside the Solar System over the past 8,000 years and the latest one happened to occur this year,” said Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb referenced the gamma-ray burst GRB 111209A, detected on December 9, 2011, as an example of an unrelated transient event. He noted that it originated from an exploding star at a distance of 13.7 billion light years, establishing its astrophysical origin unrelated to Solar System objects.</p>
<p>These findings highlight the statistical nature of gamma-ray bursts and their distribution across the sky, which helps explain the observed alignments with 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further research is expected to continue examining the alignments and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and gamma-ray bursts, with additional observations planned to deepen understanding of these phenomena.</p>
