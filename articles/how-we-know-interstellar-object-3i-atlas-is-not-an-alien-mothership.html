      <h2>How We Know Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Is Not An Alien Mothership</h2>

<p>On July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) detected a large object traveling through the Solar System, approximately 670 million kilometers from the Sun. The object, designated 3I/ATLAS, has been confirmed as an interstellar object, which means it originated from outside the Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Authorities, including NASA and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), are studying 3I/ATLAS to understand its origins and characteristics, amidst ongoing speculation about its nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of detection: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: 670 million kilometers (410 million miles)</li>
    <li>Eccentricity: Between 6.1 and 6.2</li>
    <li>Confirmed interstellar objects: 3 (1I/ʻOumuamua, 2I/Borisov, 3I/ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: NASA, SETI</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, ATLAS successfully identified 3I/ATLAS as it traveled through the Solar System. Following this, astronomers confirmed its interstellar nature by calculating its trajectory, revealing an eccentricity greater than one, which is characteristic of interstellar objects.</p>
<p>Speculation about the object's origins arose shortly after its discovery, particularly from Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who suggested it could be an alien spacecraft. However, multiple experts have since rejected this notion, emphasizing that the simplest explanation is that 3I/ATLAS is a comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“From telescope observations, astronomers can tell that 3I/ATLAS is active, which means it has an icy nucleus and a coma.”</blockquote>
<p>- NASA</p>

<blockquote>“Once the coma (and tail) became inarguable, he switched gears and said that a spacecraft should have those things after all.”</blockquote>
<p>- Jason Wright, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time there has been speculation about the origins of interstellar objects. Previous claims regarding 1I/ʻOumuamua being an alien craft were also dismissed by the scientific community. The ongoing interest in 3I/ATLAS reflects a broader fascination with interstellar travel and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves beyond its closest approach to the Sun, astronomers will continue to observe it to gather more data. Future studies may reveal additional insights about its composition and the environment from which it originated.</p>
