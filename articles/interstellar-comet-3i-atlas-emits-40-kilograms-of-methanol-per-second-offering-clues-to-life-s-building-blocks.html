      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Emits 40 Kilograms of Methanol Per Second, Offering Clues to Life’s Building Blocks</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is emitting approximately <strong>40 kilograms of methanol per second</strong>, according to NASA researchers. This activity has been observed from the comet as it travels through our solar system, marking a significant event in the study of extraterrestrial chemistry.</p>

<p>This discovery is crucial as it reveals a set of prebiotic molecules that have never been identified in an object from another star system. The findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS may provide new insights into the formation of life-supporting molecules in distant planetary systems. NASA officials are continuing to study the comet's unusual chemical composition to better understand its implications for astrobiology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Methanol Emission:</strong> 40 kilograms per second</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Agency:</strong> NASA</li>
    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Discovery of prebiotic molecules</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Within our solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent observations of 3I/ATLAS have highlighted its unique chemical activity. NASA researchers have conducted ongoing studies of the comet since its discovery, focusing on its emissions and chemical composition.</p>

<p>The comet's unusual characteristics have prompted scientists to consider its implications for the understanding of life beyond Earth. The findings are part of a broader investigation into interstellar objects and their potential to contain the building blocks of life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The levels of methanol emitted by 3I/ATLAS are unprecedented compared to typical solar system comets,” said a NASA researcher. “This discovery could reshape our understanding of how life-supporting molecules form in other planetary systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS is becoming increasingly important as researchers seek to understand the origins of life in the universe. Previous studies of solar system comets have provided insights into organic chemistry, but 3I/ATLAS represents a new frontier in this research.</p>

<p>The ongoing exploration of interstellar objects has the potential to uncover more about the chemical processes that may lead to life beyond Earth, as scientists continue to analyze the unique characteristics of these celestial visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue its research on 3I/ATLAS to further investigate its chemical emissions and the implications for astrobiology. Ongoing studies will focus on understanding the comet's role in the broader context of interstellar chemistry.</p>
