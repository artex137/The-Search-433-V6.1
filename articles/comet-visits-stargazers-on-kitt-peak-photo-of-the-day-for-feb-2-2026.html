      <h2>Comet visits stargazers on Kitt Peak photo of the day for Feb. 2, 2026</h2>

<p>Skywatchers in Arizona have witnessed a stunning display as Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) streaked across the night sky on February 2, 2026, at Kitt Peak National Observatory. The comet's appearance coincided with a beautiful sunset, providing an exceptional opportunity for both amateur astronomers and researchers at the observatory.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights the rare chance for the public to observe a comet, a dynamic object that spends most of its life in the cold outer solar system. The Kitt Peak National Observatory, part of the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab, has a long history of facilitating public engagement with astronomical phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date: February 2, 2026</li>
<li>Location: Kitt Peak National Observatory, Arizona</li>
<li>Comet: C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS)</li>
<li>Telescope used: 3-foot (0.9 meter) SARA telescope</li>
<li>Comet discovered: 2023</li>
<li>Closest pass to the sun: September 2024</li>
<li>Close pass to Earth: October 2024</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) was discovered in 2023 and has since become a focal point for skywatchers. It made its closest approach to the sun in late September 2024, followed by a relatively close pass to Earth in October 2024. The comet's trajectory and brightness changes have captivated observers, making each viewing unique.</p>

<p>On February 2, 2026, the comet was visible from Kitt Peak, where stargazers utilized binoculars and telescopes to observe the icy traveler. The observatory's location in the Sonoran Desert provides ideal conditions for such astronomical events.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comets offer a rare opportunity to observe some of our solar system's most dynamic objects,” said Kenna Hughes-Castleberry, Content Manager at Space.com. “The unpredictability of their behavior is part of the draw for observers.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Kitt Peak National Observatory has a long-standing legacy of promoting public engagement with astronomy. Its dense concentration of telescopes has made it a prime location for observing celestial events. Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is one of the more widely followed comets in recent years, drawing attention from both amateur and professional astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet C/2023 A3 continues its journey through the solar system, astronomers will monitor its trajectory and behavior, providing further opportunities for public observation during future passes.</p>
