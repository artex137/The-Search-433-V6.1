      <h2>The interstellar comet secret NASA kept for 43 days</h2>

<p>NASA has released a collection of images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which flew past Mars in early October 2023. The agency kept these images under wraps for 43 days during a government shutdown. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this event.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as it marks the third confirmed detection of an interstellar object passing through our solar system. NASA aims to provide valuable data about the comet's features and chemical makeup as part of its ongoing research into interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2023, in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet passed within 19 million miles of Mars in early October 2023.</li>
    <li>The core of 3I/ATLAS measures between 1,400 feet and 3.5 miles in diameter.</li>
    <li>NASA used three spacecraft, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, and Perseverance rover, to capture images of the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth around December 19, 2023, passing within approximately 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will continue its journey through the solar system, passing Jupiter in spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS using the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System in Chile. Throughout September and October, multiple NASA spacecraft captured images of the comet as it approached the sun and passed Mars.</p>

<p>In early October, 3I/ATLAS came within 19 million miles of Mars, prompting the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN spacecraft to redirect their instruments to observe the comet. The spacecraft documented the comet’s characteristics and behavior as it interacted with the solar environment.</p>

<p>On November 19, 2023, NASA held a press conference to address conspiracy theories regarding the comet’s origins and to confirm its natural characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, NASA associate administrator, stated, "The object is a comet. It looks and behaves exactly like a comet, with all evidence pointing to a natural origin."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Shawn Domagal-Goldman, NASA’s acting astrophysics division director, noted, "Everyone controlling a telescope wants to look at the comet because it represents such a fascinating and rare opportunity."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system. The first was 1I/’Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, and the second was 2I/Borisov, found in 2019. Each detection offers scientists a rare chance to study materials from beyond our solar system without sending spacecraft across vast distances.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS in the coming weeks, with the James Webb Space Telescope scheduled to observe the comet in December 2023. This observation aims to reveal more details about the comet's composition and structure before it departs our solar system.</p>
