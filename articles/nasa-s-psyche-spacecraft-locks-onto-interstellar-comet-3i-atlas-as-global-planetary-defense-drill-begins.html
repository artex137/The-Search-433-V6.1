      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-03 20:57 UTC</p>

      <h2>NASA’s Psyche Spacecraft Locks Onto Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS as Global Planetary-Defense Drill Begins</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that its Psyche spacecraft has captured detailed observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on December 3, 2025, as part of a United Nations-backed planetary-defense exercise. The comet, which poses no threat to Earth, has been under close scrutiny from various space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it involves a global effort to refine tracking methods for potentially hazardous objects in space. The data collected from Psyche and other missions contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the comet’s trajectory and characteristics, enhancing planetary defense capabilities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of Psyche observations: September 8–9, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance of 3I/ATLAS from Psyche during observations: approximately 53 million km (33 million miles).</li>
    <li>Discovery date of 3I/ATLAS: July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 270 million km (170 million miles).</li>
    <li>Future flyby near Jupiter: March 16, 2026, at a distance of 53 million km (0.36 AU).</li>
    <li>Comet’s nucleus size: between 440 m (1,400 ft) and 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Psyche spacecraft observed comet 3I/ATLAS for eight hours on September 8–9, 2025. During this time, the comet was approximately 33 million miles (53 million km) away. The observations contributed to refining the comet’s trajectory and added to a network of at least a dozen NASA assets monitoring the comet.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2025, ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured long-exposure images of 3I/ATLAS as it passed within 30 million km of Mars. This data was used to improve the predicted trajectory of the comet by a factor of ten.</p>

<p>On December 1, 2025, reports indicated that 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting cryovolcanic activity, with jets of gas and dust being ejected from its surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations from Psyche demonstrate how bonus science from missions en route to other targets can boost planetary-defense capabilities and comet science at the same time,” NASA stated in a blog post.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is actively releasing water, just like solar-system comets,” a team of astronomers noted regarding recent findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet is unique in its accessibility for study, providing insights into the composition of icy bodies from other star systems.</p>

<p>The ongoing planetary-defense exercise, which includes multiple international partners, is a proactive measure to prepare for potential future threats from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and passes Jupiter in March 2026. Further observations and data analysis are expected to enhance understanding of interstellar comets and improve planetary defense strategies.</p>
