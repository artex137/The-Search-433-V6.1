      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: 10 Anomalies Found In Interstellar Comet By Harvard Astrophysicist Prof Avi Loeb Hints Possible Artificial Origin</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Prof. Avi Loeb has reported ten anomalies concerning the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was observed during its passage in July and August 2025. The comet's unusual characteristics have prompted discussions about its possible artificial origin.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it challenges existing scientific understanding of cometary behavior and composition. Authorities and scientists are now examining these anomalies to determine their implications for the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed in July and August 2025.</li>
    <li>The nucleus is approximately a million times more massive than 1I/`Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>It displayed a sunward jet (anti-tail) during its approach.</li>
    <li>Its gas plume contains significantly more nickel than iron.</li>
    <li>It shows extreme negative polarization, unprecedented among known comets.</li>
    <li>It brightened faster than any known comet near perihelion.</li>
    <li>The comet arrived from a direction coincident with the radio “Wow! Signal.”</li>
    <li>It exhibits non-gravitational acceleration, indicating massive evaporation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July and August 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was closely observed as it approached the inner solar system. During this period, it exhibited a sunward jet, a characteristic not typical of known comets. Its unusual gas composition and trajectory raised questions about its origin and nature.</p>

<p>Upon nearing perihelion, the comet brightened at an unprecedented rate, prompting further analysis of its physical properties. Preliminary images taken post-perihelion, however, have not shown evidence of evaporation, despite calculations indicating a loss of at least 13% of its mass.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anomalies observed in Comet 3I/ATLAS present a compelling case for further investigation into its origins,” said Prof. Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have sparked interest in the study of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. The peculiar characteristics of 3I/ATLAS contribute to ongoing discussions about the nature of interstellar travel and the potential for artificial constructs in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from Comet 3I/ATLAS to understand its anomalies better. Further observations and studies are necessary to confirm the comet's origins and the implications of its unusual properties.</p>
