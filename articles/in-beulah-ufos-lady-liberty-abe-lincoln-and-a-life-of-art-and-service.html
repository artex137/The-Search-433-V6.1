<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Dewey Blocksma's artistic journey began after a pivotal moment in an art class when a friend rescued a discarded piece he had created. This led to his recognition as an artist and marked a shift from a career in medicine to one in art. Blocksma has since developed a roadside attraction featuring his sculptures, which has drawn attention from the local community.</p>
<p>His current exhibition, “Roundtable,” opened at the Dennos Museum, showcasing his work and philosophy. Blocksma has incorporated themes of healing and guidance from historical figures like Abraham Lincoln into his art.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I feel like we all need to listen to Lincoln no matter what perspective we have,” said Blocksma. “So I keep trying to listen to him by making sculptures about him.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“In medicine, when you worry about something, you go get a second opinion. Well, I'm depending on Lincoln to give us a second opinion,” Blocksma added regarding a sculpture of Lincoln inside a drone.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Blocksma's transition from medicine to art is notable, as he reflects on his father's influence as a medical missionary and his own experiences in emergency medicine. His artistic creations often blend personal history with broader themes of healing and community. The roadside attraction has become a local landmark, fostering interest in folk art and engaging visitors in unique ways.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the exhibition continues at the Dennos Museum, Dewey Blocksma plans to engage with the community through additional events and discussions about his work and artistic philosophy. The impact of his art on local culture is expected to grow as more visitors come to experience his creations.</p>
