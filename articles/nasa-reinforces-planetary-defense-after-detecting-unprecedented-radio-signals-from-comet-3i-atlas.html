      <h2>NASA reinforces planetary defense after detecting unprecedented radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has raised the alert level of its Planetary Defense program after detecting radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS on January 9, 2026. The comet, which is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, was initially discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawaii.</p>

<p>This detection has prompted NASA to implement intensive monitoring protocols to analyze the comet's composition, trajectory, and nature. Although the comet does not pose a threat to Earth, the unusual signals have led authorities to enhance their understanding of such cosmic visitors. NASA is collaborating with the European Space Agency (ESA) to share data and maximize observation time of the object before it returns to interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on January 9, 2026.</li>
    <li>Initial detection by ATLAS in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>Radio emissions recorded at a frequency of 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for late 2026, approximately 27 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>Collaboration with ESA for enhanced tracking and observation.</li>
    <li>Signals suggest the presence of hydroxyl (OH) molecules.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS astronomical survey in Hawaii. Following this discovery, a global network of radio telescopes, including the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, confirmed the detection of radio signals. These signals have raised the alert level in NASA's Planetary Defense program, leading to intensified observation and analysis protocols.</p>
<p>The comet is confirmed to be on a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it will pass through our solar system without becoming trapped by the Sun's gravity. Its closest approach to Earth is anticipated at the end of 2026, allowing for detailed observations by ground- and space-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of radio signals from 3I/ATLAS provides a rare opportunity to study an object formed in another star system,” said a NASA representative. “This event is not only crucial for scientific understanding but also serves as a practical exercise for our planetary defense protocols.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the earlier interstellar visitors ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS exhibits unique characteristics, including its radio emissions. The study of interstellar objects is critical as they offer insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems, including our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The global astronomical community will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS over the coming months, utilizing various instruments to gather extensive data. This ongoing research will help refine trajectory prediction models and prepare for future potential threats.</p>
