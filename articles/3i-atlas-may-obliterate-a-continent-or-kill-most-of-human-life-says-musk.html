      <h2>3I/ATLAS may 'obliterate a continent' or 'kill most of human life', says Musk</h2>

<p>Elon Musk has stated that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is approaching Earth, could pose a significant threat if it deviates from its predicted trajectory. Musk made these comments during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. The object is expected to come closest to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</p>

<p>This situation has raised concerns among scientists and astronomers, who are closely monitoring the object’s path. Authorities, including those from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, have been tracking 3I/ATLAS since it was first spotted on July 1, 2023. The potential risks associated with this object have led to discussions about its origin and nature, with some suggesting it could be of extraterrestrial origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach Date:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Detection Date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 130,000 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Comment:</strong> Musk stated it could 'obliterate a continent'</li>
    <li><strong>Tracking Agency:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by astronomers on July 1, 2023. Since then, it has been closely monitored by various telescopes worldwide. On October 30, 2023, the object made its closest approach to the Sun, where it exhibited unexpected non-gravitational accelerations and emitted a detected radio signal. Musk’s comments regarding the object’s potential threat were made during a podcast appearance on November 15, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it hit Earth it would like obliterate a continent type of thing... Maybe worse. Probably kill most of human life. If not all of us,”</blockquote>
<p>- Elon Musk, during the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to be detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unusual characteristics have led to extensive speculation about its origin, with some experts suggesting it might have been wandering through space for billions of years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring of 3I/ATLAS will continue as it approaches Earth. Scientists are particularly focused on its trajectory and the possibility of detecting signals or course changes between December 19 and 25, 2023.</p>
