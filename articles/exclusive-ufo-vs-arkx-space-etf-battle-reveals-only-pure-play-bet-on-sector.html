      <h2>Exclusive: UFO Vs. ARKX Space ETF Battle Reveals 'Only Pure Play' Bet on Sector</h2>

<p>The Procure Space ETF (NASDAQ:UFO) has established itself as the only pure-play space ETF in the United States since its launch in 2019, according to Procure Holdings CEO Andrew Chanin. The ETF focuses on companies with direct exposure to the space industry, which may attract more attention if a potential SpaceX IPO occurs in 2026. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this financial sector development.</p>

<p>This distinction matters as it highlights the difference between UFO and other space-themed ETFs, such as the Ark Space & Defense Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX), launched in 2021. Chanin stated that maintaining a pure-play focus is central to the firm’s identity and sets it apart from competitors. Authorities in the financial sector are closely monitoring these developments as investor interest in space-related investments continues to grow.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Procure Space ETF (UFO) launched in 2019.</li>
    <li>Ark Space & Defense Innovation ETF (ARKX) launched in 2021.</li>
    <li>Approximately 80% of companies in UFO derive majority revenue from space-related activities.</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To my knowledge, UFO is the only pure play space ETF out there in the United States,” Chanin said. “That's important to us because it has to be, our fund is called the Procure Space ETF. We have the trademark space ETF.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It's taking into account companies that are actually doing space. They're actually making money from space,” Chanin stated regarding the focus of the Procure Space ETF.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>

With the growing interest in the sector, ETFs that focus on space may experience significant investor demand. The differences in holdings between UFO and ARKX illustrate the variety of investment approaches within the space sector.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
