      <h2>New hypothesis sparking 3I/ATLAS debate: what if it was a mothership?</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has raised questions about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it could be an extraterrestrial mothership. His claims were published on November 26, 2025, in an article on Medium, where he identified a "new extraordinary anomaly" in the comet's behavior.</p>

<p>This hypothesis has reignited discussions within the scientific community regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities in the field are reviewing Loeb's calculations and observations to assess the implications of his claims about the comet's potential technological origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of publication:</strong> November 26, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Object in question:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Proposed distance for technology deposition:</strong> 53.502 million kilometers from Jupiter</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum predicted distance for 3I/ATLAS:</strong> 53.445 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Published by:</strong> Avi Loeb on Medium</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 26, 2025, Avi Loeb published his observations regarding 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may not be a comet but rather an extraterrestrial mothership. He based his hypothesis on astronomical calculations related to Jupiter's gravitational influence, specifically the Hill's radius. This distance will be 53.502 million kilometers on March 16, 2026, closely aligning with the predicted trajectory of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Suppose, hypothetically, that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a mothership designed to seed Jupiter with technological devices. What would be the greatest distance from Jupiter that this interstellar gardener should reach?”</blockquote>
<p>- Avi Loeb</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate over the nature of 3I/ATLAS has been ongoing since its discovery. Previous discussions have focused on its classification as an interstellar object, with Loeb being a prominent advocate for considering alternative explanations regarding its origin and purpose.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts in the field are expected to analyze Loeb's latest calculations and assess their implications for the understanding of 3I/ATLAS. Further studies may be conducted to explore the object's characteristics and trajectory as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
