      <h2>Physicist Avi Loeb Critiques Brian Cox's Theory on Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has publicly criticized British physicist Brian Cox's claims regarding interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which was first observed on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The debate has intensified as both scientists present contrasting views on the object's origins and nature.</p>

<p>The controversy is significant as it highlights differing scientific perspectives on the interpretation of 3I/ATLAS. The discussion has drawn attention from both the scientific community and space enthusiasts, prompting further investigation into the object’s characteristics. Authorities have not disclosed any official findings regarding the interstellar object's classification.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025, in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has published 11 scientific papers on 3I/ATLAS since its discovery.</li>
    <li>Brian Cox described 3I/ATLAS as a comet made of carbon dioxide and water ices.</li>
    <li>Loeb referred to 3I/ATLAS as potentially being a “Trojan Horse” for alien technology.</li>
    <li>Cox posted his theory on X (formerly Twitter) on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb's interview discussing 3I/ATLAS aired on FOX News on October 28, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is first observed by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, scientists begin to debate its nature and origin. On October 28, 2025, Avi Loeb appears in an interview where he discusses the object's unusual characteristics. The next day, on October 29, 2025, Brian Cox shares his perspective on X, asserting that 3I/ATLAS is entirely natural in origin. This exchange has sparked significant discourse within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “I explained that Brian Cox did not write a single scientific paper about 3I/ATLAS. He acts as a science popularizer rather than a researcher who is engaged with the related science concerning 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb added, “Rather than engage in sweeping statements, Brian should be challenged to explain the 9 anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Brian Cox described 3I/ATLAS as “a pristine lump of rock and ices” and emphasized its natural origin.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This debate reflects a broader discussion within the scientific community regarding the classification of interstellar objects. Previous incidents, such as the discovery of the first interstellar object, have raised questions about the origins of these cosmic bodies. The contrasting views of Loeb and Cox illustrate the ongoing exploration of the universe and the implications of potential extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into 3I/ATLAS are expected as scientists continue to analyze its characteristics. The debate between Loeb and Cox may influence future research and discussions regarding interstellar objects.</p>
