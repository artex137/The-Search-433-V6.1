      <h2>X files? Trump says he's ordering release of data on UFOs and aliens</h2>

<p>US President Donald Trump has announced that he is directing federal agencies to begin identifying and releasing government files related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and extraterrestrial life. The announcement was made on Thursday via Trump's Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>This move comes amid a growing public interest in UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Trump stated he will instruct the Secretary of War and other relevant departments to disclose any information connected to these matters. However, he did not specify whether classified documents would be included in the release.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Announcement made by President Donald Trump on October 12, 2023.</li>
    <li>Files to include information on UFOs, UAP, and extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>Trump claimed former President Barack Obama revealed "classified" information in a recent podcast.</li>
    <li>Obama's comments addressed speculation about extraterrestrial life and Area 51.</li>
    <li>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated no prepared speech on extraterrestrial life existed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 12, 2023, President Trump made his announcement regarding the release of UFO-related files. Earlier that day, he commented on remarks made by former President Obama during a podcast, claiming Obama had disclosed classified information. Obama had addressed public curiosity about extraterrestrial life, stating, "They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in... Area 51."</p>

<p>In March 2024, the Pentagon released a report indicating no evidence that UAP were of alien origin, attributing many sightings to conventional objects such as weather balloons and spy planes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs),” said Trump.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“He made a big mistake,” Trump added, referring to Obama’s comments on the podcast.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UFOs and UAP has surged in recent years, particularly following government investigations into reports of unusual aerial activity. Concerns have been raised about potential foreign adversaries testing advanced technologies. Despite this interest, no definitive evidence of intelligent extraterrestrial life has been produced.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The next steps involve the Secretary of War and relevant agencies beginning the process of identifying and releasing the specified files. Further updates on the release timeline and content of the documents have not been disclosed.</p>
