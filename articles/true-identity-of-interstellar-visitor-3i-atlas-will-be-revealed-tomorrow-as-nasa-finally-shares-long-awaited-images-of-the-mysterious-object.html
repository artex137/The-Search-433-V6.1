      <h2>True identity of interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS to be revealed tomorrow</h2>

<p>NASA will unveil the true identity of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS on November 19, 2025, during a press conference at 15:00 EST (20:00 GMT). The announcement comes after more than a month of silence due to a government shutdown that affected communications. The agency will share never-before-seen images of the object, which were collected by its spacecraft and telescopes, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it may clarify the origins of 3I/ATLAS and put to rest speculation about it being an artificial object. Experts have expressed confidence that the new images will confirm the object’s status as a comet from another planetary system. Dr. Matthew Genge from Imperial College London stated, “All the evidence so far is consistent with a comet from another planetary system.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of announcement:</strong> November 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Press conference time:</strong> 15:00 EST (20:00 GMT)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest distance to Mars:</strong> 19 million miles (30 million kilometres) on October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest distance to the sun:</strong> 130 million miles (210 million kilometres) on October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Previous observations:</strong> Images released by the European Space Agency (ESA)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was confirmed as an interstellar object in early June 2025. The comet reached its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, allowing for detailed observations. On October 29, it came closest to the sun, prompting increased activity. Following a government shutdown from October 1 to November 12, NASA has now resumed communications and will share new images tomorrow.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is very little speculation amongst scientists... There is no evidence to suggest 3I/ATLAS is artificial.”</blockquote>
<p>— Dr. Matthew Genge, Imperial College London</p>

<blockquote>“Details of its shape by direct observation would be good.”</blockquote>
<p>— Professor March Burchell, University of Kent</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third object from another solar system detected by scientists. Previous observations have highlighted its unique features, including a highly irradiated surface and an unusual 'anti-tail' that points towards the sun. The government shutdown hindered NASA's ability to communicate findings during a crucial observation period.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will broadcast the press conference live, encouraging public engagement through social media using the hashtag '#AskNASA'. Observatories worldwide will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest pass to Earth next month, at a distance of 170 million miles (273 million kilometres).</p>
