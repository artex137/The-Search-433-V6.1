      <h2>Watch Out! UN on Alert as ‘Alien’ Visitor 3I/ATLAS Set to Brush Past Earth Soon</h2>

<p>A new interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS has drawn global attention as it prepares to pass near Earth on December 19, 2025. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a United Nations-endorsed group, has initiated a special global observing campaign to monitor this comet-like object.</p>

<p>The campaign is significant because it aims to improve our understanding of comets, which are challenging to study due to their glowing gas clouds and tails. IAWN will conduct observations from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026. Astronomers interested in participating must join a workshop before November 7, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Campaign Dates:</strong> November 27, 2025 - January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Workshop Registration Deadline:</strong> November 7, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Size:</strong> More than 33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> 29 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered our Solar System from outside and was detected by scientists worldwide. The IAWN announced its global campaign to observe the object, which will run from late November 2025 to late January 2026. Significant observations will occur when the object passes close to the Sun around October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>Notably, scientists, including Harvard's Avi Loeb, have highlighted the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, suggesting that it may carry unique properties compared to typical comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The odds of 3I/ATLAS's characteristics occurring naturally are incredibly small, about one in ten quadrillion,” said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “We will hopefully get an image with a 30-kilometer pixel size, and examine the brightest pixel to infer how big the object is,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is not the first interstellar object to attract attention; previous visitors include Oumuamua and Borisov. However, 3I/ATLAS has exhibited distinct features that raise questions about its nature and origin.</p>

<p>The campaign led by IAWN is part of a broader effort to enhance our understanding of potential threats from space and the characteristics of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach to the Sun, scientists will monitor 3I/ATLAS for any unusual activity. The Galileo Project team, led by Loeb, is preparing to analyze the data collected and determine whether the object is merely an odd comet or something more significant from beyond our Solar System.</p>
