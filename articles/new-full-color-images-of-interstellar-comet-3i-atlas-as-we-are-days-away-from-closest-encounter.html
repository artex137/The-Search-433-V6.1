      <h2>New Full-Color Images Of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS, As We Are Days Away From Closest Encounter</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has garnered significant attention as it approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023, when it will be approximately 270 million kilometers (168 million miles) from our planet. Observatories, both on Earth and in space, have captured new images and data about the comet, which recently displayed a green hue.</p>

<p>The latest observations have revealed important insights into the comet’s composition and behavior. The findings come as part of public engagement initiatives aimed at increasing transparency in scientific research. This opportunity allows the public to participate in scientific observations using advanced telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 270 million kilometers (168 million miles)</li>
    <li>Recent observations made: November 26 and December 3, 2023</li>
    <li>Notable observation tools: Gemini North telescope, ESA’s XMM-Newton, and XRISM telescope</li>
    <li>Program involved: Shadow the Scientists</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 26, 2023, the Gemini North telescope captured an image of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing its transition to a green hue likely caused by the release of diatomic carbon (C<sub>2</sub>). This observation was made when the comet was about 288 million kilometers (179 million miles) from Earth.</p>

<p>On December 3, 2023, the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton telescope conducted observations of the comet for approximately 20 hours, detecting clear X-ray emissions as the comet was about 282–285 million kilometers (175-177 million miles) from the spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Sharing an observing experience in some of the best conditions available gives the public a truly front-row view of our interstellar visitor,” said Bryce Bolin, a research scientist from Eureka Scientific.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Allowing the public to see what we do as astronomers and how we do it also helps demystify the scientific and data collection process, adding transparency to our study of this fascinating object,” Bolin added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the latest interstellar object to be studied, following the discoveries of 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, which were not detected in X-rays, 3I/ATLAS has shown clear X-ray emissions, potentially providing new insights into the composition of comets from other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its activity and gather data. Observations will help determine the comet’s characteristics and contribute to the understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
