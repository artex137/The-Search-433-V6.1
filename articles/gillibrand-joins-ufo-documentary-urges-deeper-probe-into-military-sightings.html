      <h2>Gillibrand joins UFO documentary, urges deeper probe into military sightings</h2>

<p>U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has participated in a new Amazon Prime documentary titled "Age of Disclosure," which will air next month. The film explores whether the government has concealed information regarding UFOs, now referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). Gillibrand and other congressional members are seeking to enhance the military's investigations into UAP sightings and related incidents.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it relates to national security and public safety. Gillibrand has advocated for transparency regarding military encounters with UAPs, emphasizing the need for thorough investigations. She has worked with bipartisan support to establish the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (ARRO) within the Pentagon to address these concerns.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary "Age of Disclosure" will premiere next month.</li>
    <li>Gillibrand has previously stated that about half of UAP sightings can be explained.</li>
    <li>She mentioned that 50% of sightings remain unidentified, raising concerns.</li>
    <li>ARRO was established to investigate UAP sightings and related testimonies.</li>
    <li>Congress held hearings on UAPs in November 2022.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2022, Congress convened hearings on UAPs, during which former pilots and experts provided testimonies. Gillibrand emphasized her commitment to uncovering facts about these phenomena.</p>

<p>Recently, Gillibrand discussed her involvement in the documentary "Age of Disclosure" and reiterated the importance of understanding the nature of UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "My job as a senator is to get to the bottom and to know facts," Gillibrand told NBC News.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "That means there's 50 percent that are still unidentified and that's a concerning number," she added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "If it is in fact otherworldly, that's very interesting, and I don't think it creates panic," Gillibrand said in response to concerns about public reaction to potential revelations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this initiative, there have been claims of government coverups regarding UAPs. Gillibrand pointed out that some individuals within the Department of Defense signed nondisclosure agreements relating to programs involving alien materials.</p>

<p>These historical claims have fueled ongoing discussions about the military's transparency and accountability concerning UAP investigations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP sightings will continue through the ARRO, with Congress monitoring progress and ensuring that military actions regarding unidentified objects are thoroughly evaluated.</p>
