      <h2>Alleged NASA leak of 3I/ATLAS image and Japanese ‘breathtaking view’ create online frenzy</h2>

<p>A new wave of online chatter has erupted after users claimed that an image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was allegedly leaked from NASA. Reports indicate that the unverified photo shows detailed structures that have sparked curiosity among space enthusiasts. NASA has not confirmed these claims, and the authenticity of the images remains unverified.</p>

<p>The speculation surrounding 3I/ATLAS is significant as it could provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects. Scientists continue to analyze the comet’s composition, path, and origin while verifying the claims circulating online.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025, in Chile by the ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at speeds exceeding 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to the Sun occurred on 30 October 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently about 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 270 million kilometres) from Earth.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency’s JUICE mission is observing the comet from 2 to 25 November 2025.</li>
    <li>Observation data from JUICE are expected by February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered in Chile by the ATLAS telescope. The comet approached the Sun on 30 October 2025. Following this, discussions about alleged leaked images began circulating online. Observers in Japan shared their own visuals of the comet, which they described as breathtaking.</p>
<p>As of now, scientists are verifying the claims about the alleged NASA leak while continuing their study of the comet's features and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If this is real it changes Everything, as this shows clearly a SpaceCraft defined by structures lines covered in a ton of Dust from its travel,” a social media user stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The Japanese strike again with a breathtaking view of 3I ATLAS,” another post claimed.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique as it is an interstellar comet, meaning it originates from outside our solar system. Its hyperbolic trajectory ensures it will not return once it leaves. The study of such comets can provide valuable information about the formation of comets in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to verify the online claims regarding the alleged NASA leak while conducting observations with the JUICE mission. Updates on the findings and any confirmed images are expected in the coming months.</p>
