      <h2>Belgian military to gain right to shoot down drones after UFO incident</h2>

<p>The Belgian military has announced it will receive the authority to shoot down unidentified flying objects (UFOs) following a recent incident involving unexplained aerial phenomena. This decision comes as authorities aim to enhance national security and address growing concerns about airspace safety.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it reflects the increasing need for military readiness in the face of unidentified aerial threats. The Belgian government has recognized the potential risks posed by such incidents and is taking proactive measures to empower the military in response.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, the Belgian military has reported multiple sightings of unidentified flying objects in its airspace. The exact dates of these sightings have not been disclosed, but they have prompted discussions about the safety and security of the nation’s airspace.</p>

<p>Following these incidents, the Belgian government convened to evaluate the military's capabilities and the need for new regulations regarding aerial threats. The decision to grant the military the authority to engage with drones and other unidentified aircraft was made in light of these evaluations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
