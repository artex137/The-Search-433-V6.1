      <h2>3I/Atlas Suddenly 'Wakes Up' in Deep Space as Juice Spacecraft Captures Shock Activity</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency's (ESA) JUICE spacecraft has captured significant activity from comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a glowing halo and potential tails on 2 November 2025. This event marks the first time the comet has shown such dramatic signs of outgassing since its discovery by the ATLAS survey on 1 July 2025. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this observation.</p>

<p>This observation is important as it provides researchers with rare data about an interstellar object shortly after its perihelion, when comets typically exhibit peak activity. Scientists are now anticipating a full dataset from JUICE's five scientific instruments, expected in February 2026, which will help them understand the comet's composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The significant outgassing activity was observed by JUICE on 2 November 2025.</li>
    <li>JUICE's closest approach to 3I/ATLAS occurred approximately 66 million kilometres away.</li>
    <li>Data from JUICE's instruments will be delivered between 18 and 20 February 2026.</li>
    <li>Previous observations indicated a coma dominated by carbon dioxide.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered by the ATLAS survey on 1 July 2025. Following its trajectory toward the Sun, Earth-based telescopes tracked its path until it moved out of sight. From early October to mid-November 2025, Mars orbiters monitored the comet as it passed near Mars. On 2 November, JUICE captured images of the comet, revealing a glowing coma and evidence of vigorous outgassing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observation campaign was unexpected for everybody,” said the scientific team at ESA. “JUICE being in the right place at the right time has allowed us to gain insights into an interstellar object.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our Solar System. Previous observations using the James Webb Space Telescope suggested that the comet's coma is unusual, dominated by carbon dioxide rather than the typical water ice found in many Solar System comets. This difference indicates that 3I/ATLAS may have a surface enriched in primitive ices, suggesting a unique formation history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will analyse the data from JUICE’s instruments when it arrives in February 2026. This analysis could provide a detailed understanding of the comet's coma, tail dynamics, and nucleus structure, contributing to broader knowledge about interstellar comets and their origins.</p>
