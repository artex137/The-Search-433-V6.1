      <h2>New Documentary Claims George HW Bush Knew of Alien Contact</h2>

<p>A new documentary has sparked speculation about former President George HW Bush's knowledge of extraterrestrial contact, as a retired US astrophysicist alleges Bush privately revealed details of a 1964 incident at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. The documentary, titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, claims that Bush described a meeting between US Air Force and CIA personnel and a "non-human entity" during private conversations in 2003. No physical evidence has been provided to support these claims.</p>

<p>This matter has raised significant interest among UFO enthusiasts and lawmakers, who are calling for greater transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. The film claims to document a secret multi-agency operation, referred to as the "Legacy Program," which allegedly involves the CIA, US Air Force, Department of Energy, and unidentified defense contractors. However, the documentary does not present verifiable documentation or corroborating witnesses to support its assertions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> released on Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li>Claims George HW Bush spoke about alien contact in 2003.</li>
    <li>Incident described occurred in 1964 at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.</li>
    <li>Eric Davis, former adviser to the Pentagon’s AATIP, made the allegations.</li>
    <li>Bush died in 2018 and did not publicly address these claims.</li>
    <li>No physical evidence or corroborating witnesses have been provided in the documentary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1964, a reported incident at Holloman Air Force Base involves a landing spacecraft and a non-human entity interacting with US military personnel.</p>
<p>In 2003, George HW Bush allegedly discusses the incident with Eric Davis during private conversations.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> is released on Amazon Prime, reigniting public interest and speculation about UFOs and government transparency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Several different types of ETs have been recovered,” said Hal Puthoff, a physicist and former AATIP member, in reference to the claims made in the documentary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Repeated incidents involving unidentified objects over restricted nuclear sites deserve inquiry,” stated former Senator Marco Rubio, emphasizing national security concerns.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Take me to Roswell… open it up, is not how government works,” Rubio added, challenging the idea that presidents have immediate access to all classified UFO files.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary highlights ongoing national security concerns regarding unexplained aerial activities near military facilities. Previous incidents, such as the Roswell incident, have fueled public interest and speculation about government knowledge of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Despite numerous claims and testimonies, definitive proof of alien contact remains elusive, with many assertions lacking verification or credible evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers continue to demand transparency and inquiry into unidentified aerial phenomena, while the documentary contributes to the ongoing public fascination with UFOs and potential extraterrestrial encounters.</p>
