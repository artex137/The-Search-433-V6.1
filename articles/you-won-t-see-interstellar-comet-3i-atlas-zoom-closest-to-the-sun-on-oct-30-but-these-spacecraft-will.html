      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to Reach Perihelion on October 30</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its perihelion, or closest point to the sun, on October 30, 2023, at a distance of 1.35 astronomical units (125 million miles, or 202 million kilometers) from the sun. The comet is currently not visible from Earth as it is positioned behind the sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers, as perihelion marks the period when the comet is expected to be most active. Despite being hidden from view, various spacecraft in the solar system will observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun. Researchers are particularly interested in the chemical makeup of the comet, which may provide insights into the conditions of the molecular cloud that formed it over seven billion years ago.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 30, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from the sun at perihelion: 1.35 AU (125 million miles or 202 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Current visibility: Not visible from Earth</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2023, at 0.19 AU (17.6 million miles or 28.4 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Spacecraft observing 3I/ATLAS: NASA's Psyche and Lucy missions, European Space Agency's JUICE probe</li>
    <li>Expected magnitude upon re-emergence: 12</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS began its perihelion approach, becoming lost in the sun's glare at the end of September 2023. It will not be visible again from Earth until late November or early December 2023, after it completes its closest approach to the sun.</p>
<p>On October 3, 2023, 3I/ATLAS passed within 0.19 AU of Mars, where several spacecraft were able to observe it. As it reaches perihelion on October 30, it will be closely monitored by missions stationed throughout the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Scientists are most interested in studying the chemistry of the comet at perihelion, because the gases and dust that come off the comet reveal its composition,” said a spokesperson from NASA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet, meaning it is not in orbit around the sun but is passing through the solar system. This is a rare phenomenon, and studying such comets helps scientists understand the origins of our solar system and the conditions that existed in the early universe. Previous observations have indicated that 3I/ATLAS contains more carbon dioxide and nickel than typical comets found within the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After perihelion, 3I/ATLAS is expected to re-emerge from behind the sun in late November or early December 2023. It will continue to be observed by various spacecraft, and astronomers hope to gather more data on its composition and behavior as it moves away from the sun.</p>
