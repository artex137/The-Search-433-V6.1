      <h2>3I/ATLAS spotted by 12 NASA spacecraft: What Mars, asteroid and solar missions saw</h2>

<p>Nasa has released images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS captured by 12 of its spacecraft, including those involved in Mars, solar, and asteroid missions. The images were made public on November 19, following observations made during the comet’s flyby on October 2 and 3.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it showcases the capabilities of NASA’s various missions to study celestial objects. NASA officials have confirmed that the comet is indeed just that—a comet—disputing claims by some scientists that it may be more than a simple icy body from another star system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The best observations were made by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) during the comet's flyby on October 2 and 3.</li>
    <li>The MRO captured images of the comet from about 30 million kilometres away.</li>
    <li>Other NASA missions involved include MAVEN, Perseverance, STEREO, and PUNCH.</li>
    <li>ESA and NASA’s SOHO mission observed the comet from October 15 to 26.</li>
    <li>The Psyche and Lucy spacecraft also captured images of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2023. NASA’s spacecraft began capturing images of the comet shortly after its discovery, with the MRO making significant observations during the flyby on October 2 and 3. The agency continued to gather images from various missions until the public release on November 19.</p>

<p>NASA’s STEREO mission captured images from September 11 to October 2, while the PUNCH mission observed the comet’s tail between September 20 and October 3. Observations by ESA and SOHO occurred from October 15 to 26.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is a comet,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s associate administrator.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” stated Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous claims by Harvard scientist Avi Loeb suggested that 3I/ATLAS might be more than a comet, citing its unusual behaviour. However, NASA has consistently dismissed these assertions, attributing the comet's characteristics to its interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, with opportunities for additional observations by various missions in the future.</p>
