      <h2>Nostradamus Predicted 3I ATLAS Arrival Centuries Ago? Scientists and Prophecy Collide in 2025</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth, with its closest approach expected in mid-December 2025. The discovery has sparked discussions about potential connections to prophecies by Nostradamus. While scientists emphasize there is no danger, public interest in the relationship between prophecy and astronomy is growing.</p>

<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks the third confirmed interstellar object to be observed, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Researchers and historians are examining both the comet's features and Nostradamus' writings to explore any implications of this event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>Closest point to the Sun is around October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nearest approach to Earth will be approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or 168 million miles, in mid-December 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS does not belong to our solar system and will leave it permanently.</li>
    <li>ESA has noted the object features an “anti-tail,” a rare characteristic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS. This interstellar object was identified by the ATLAS survey. In the following months, scientists observed unusual patterns in its light and structure. By October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun.</p>
<p>In mid-December 2025, 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth, but NASA has confirmed there is no risk of collision.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “NASA and ESA confirm the object poses no risk to Earth. Scientists emphasize the importance of observation and data collection,” according to a joint statement from both agencies.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Some historians have linked Nostradamus' quatrains to the arrival of 3I/ATLAS. A notable verse describes a “fireball from the cosmos,” prompting speculation about its significance. Other quatrains mention themes such as wars and plagues, which some interpret in the context of current global events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 2025 progresses, scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS and collect data. The object will permanently leave the solar system after its December approach, and the ongoing interest in its connection to prophecy may inspire further study in both scientific and historical fields.</p>
