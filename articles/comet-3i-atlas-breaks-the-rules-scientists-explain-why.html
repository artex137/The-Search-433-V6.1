      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Breaks the Rules. Scientists Explain Why</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, officially designated as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile, the comet has revealed unusual characteristics that challenge existing astronomical norms.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it enhances our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. Scientists have noted that Comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits unique features, including a hyperbolic orbit and an impressive velocity of approximately 221,000 km/h. Observations during its close approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, have provided unprecedented opportunities for study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li>Close approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 AU (about 270 million km)</li>
    <li>Nucleus size: Ranges from 440 meters to 5.6 km</li>
    <li>Peak escape velocity: 246,000 km/h during perihelion on October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Green glow observed on November 26, 2025</li>
    <li>Anti-tail observed: December 17–21, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. It exhibited a hyperbolic orbit, confirming its interstellar origin. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, peaking in velocity at 246,000 km/h. Observations intensified as it approached Earth on December 19, 2025, allowing for studies using advanced telescopes.</p>

<p>Notable observations included an X-ray halo detected by telescopes such as Hubble and XRISM, revealing interactions with the solar wind. A green glow was noted on November 26, followed by the observation of an anti-tail phenomenon between December 17 and 21, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The X-ray emissions and the green glow of gases like diatomic carbon are remarkable findings that provide insight into the comet's unique properties,” said a lead researcher involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is among a growing list of interstellar objects that have sparked interest in the scientific community. Its characteristics, including a dry composition and the absence of typical water signatures, raise questions about the nature of such celestial bodies. The phenomenon of an anti-tail is particularly rare and highlights the complexities of observing interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from the observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS. Further studies may reveal more about its composition and origins as it journeys back into deep space.</p>
