      <h2>NASA tracks interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS zooming at 61 km/s, says no danger to Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that Comet 3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar visitor, is currently travelling through the solar system at a speed of 61 kilometres per second. The comet, first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, poses no threat to Earth, according to the agency.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua’ in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA continues to monitor the comet's trajectory and speed as it approaches the Sun, ensuring that it remains at a safe distance from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been travelling at approximately 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will come within about 210 million kilometres of the Sun, just inside the orbit of Mars.</li>
    <li>NASA states it will not approach Earth any closer than 1.8 astronomical units, or roughly 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The comet will continue its journey beyond Jupiter by March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. Since then, NASA has tracked its speed and trajectory as it moves towards the Sun. The comet is expected to reach perihelion on October 30, 2025, and will pass behind the Sun later this month before continuing its path out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet will not approach Earth any closer than 1.8 astronomical units, or roughly 270 million kilometres,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar object confirmed by NASA. The previous interstellar visitors, ‘Oumuamua’ and 2I/Borisov, were observed in 2017 and 2019, respectively. These discoveries have expanded our understanding of objects entering our solar system from interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to track Comet 3I/ATLAS using advanced observatories, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, as it continues its journey beyond Jupiter and eventually exits the solar system.</p>
