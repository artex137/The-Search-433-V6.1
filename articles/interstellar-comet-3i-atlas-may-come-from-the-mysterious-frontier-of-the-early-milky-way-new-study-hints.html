      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may come from the mysterious frontier of the early Milky Way, new study hints</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS does not originate from the Milky Way’s familiar regions and may instead serve as a time capsule of the early galaxy, according to a new study. The research suggests that the comet’s trajectory indicates it may have come from a region where the galaxy's oldest and youngest stars converge. 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in late June 2023 and confirmed by NASA in early July.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may help scientists understand the origins and composition of early cosmic bodies. Researchers are currently analyzing data to confirm the comet's trajectory and potential origins, as 3I/ATLAS approaches the sun and continues its journey through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between 4.8 and 11.2 kilometers wide.</li>
    <li>It travels at approximately 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The study utilized data from the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in late June 2023 and confirmed by NASA in early July. The comet has been on a trajectory that takes it through the solar system, with a close approach to Mars recorded on October 3, 2023. It is expected to pass closest to the sun on October 30, 2023, before heading towards interstellar space.</p>
<p>Researchers have traced the comet's path back over the last 4 million years, identifying 62 nearby stars that may have influenced its orbit, although none have significantly altered its trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We have found that none of the stars in the solar neighborhood can explain the trajectory and high velocity of 3I/ATLAS,” said Xabier Pérez-Couto, lead study author and astrophysics postgraduate student at Spain's Universidade da Coruña.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS adds to our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. While previous interstellar objects have been observed, 3I/ATLAS stands out due to its size and speed, prompting interest from astronomers worldwide. Understanding its origins may provide insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its path through the solar system, instruments on Earth, Mars, and in orbit around Jupiter will conduct further studies to analyze the comet's composition and gather more data on its origins.</p>
