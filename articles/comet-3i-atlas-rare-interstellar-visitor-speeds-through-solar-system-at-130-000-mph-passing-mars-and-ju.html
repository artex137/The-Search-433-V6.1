      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-04 04:46 UTC</p>

      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Rare interstellar visitor speeds through solar system at 130,000 mph</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, is currently passing through our solar system at a speed of 130,000 mph (219,000 km/h). The comet, which originated from beyond our Sun, is expected to make its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, and will later pass near Jupiter during its perihelion.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system. Space agencies like the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA are preparing to observe the comet closely, utilizing spacecraft to study its structure and chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 130,000 mph (219,000 km/h)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025, at approximately 30 million kilometers (18.6 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion near Jupiter:</strong> November 2 to 25, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus size:</strong> Less than 1 kilometer wide</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated mass:</strong> Over 33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> Approximately 1.8 AU (170 million miles) in December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers using the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile identified the comet. The discovery confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its interstellar origin. Following this, the comet will make its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, allowing for detailed observations by Mars orbiters.</p>

<p>After passing Mars, 3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion near Jupiter between November 2 and 25, 2025. During this time, ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will monitor the comet as it becomes highly active due to solar heating.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This encounter allows scientists to study the comet up close, as Earth-based observations during this period are limited due to its proximity to the Sun,” said a representative from ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides a unique opportunity to study interstellar chemistry and planetary formation. Previous interstellar objects have offered insights, but 3I/ATLAS is larger and contains a complex mixture of gases, including water ice, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide.</p>

<p>The scientific consensus is that 3I/ATLAS is a natural interstellar comet, despite some speculation about unusual origins. Its characteristics make it a valuable subject for understanding the building blocks of planets in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to prepare for observations of 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the solar system. Scientists aim to analyze the gases and dust in its tail to learn more about the conditions that shape worlds beyond our own.</p>
