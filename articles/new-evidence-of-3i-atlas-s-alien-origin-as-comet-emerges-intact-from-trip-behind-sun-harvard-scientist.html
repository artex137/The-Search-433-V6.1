      <h2>New evidence of 3I/ATLAS’s alien origin as comet emerges intact from trip behind sun: Harvard scientist</h2>

<p>Recent images of comet 3I/ATLAS, captured on November 11 by the Nordic Optical Telescope in Spain’s Canary Islands, show that the comet has remained intact following its close approach to the sun, according to Harvard scientist Avi Loeb. Loeb has suggested that this evidence could indicate the comet is artificial, despite skepticism from other space experts.</p>

<p>The significance of these findings has prompted further investigation into the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Astronomers and scientists are currently analyzing the comet's structural integrity and its unusual jets, which could provide insights into its origins and behavior in space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was photographed on November 11, 2025.</li>
    <li>The images were taken at the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims the comet's jets suggest it is larger than expected for a natural body.</li>
    <li>Loeb's calculations indicate the required surface area for its jets exceeds 1,600 square kilometers.</li>
    <li>Michigan State University professor Darryl Seligman estimates the nucleus size at around 1 km.</li>
    <li>The MeerKAT radio telescope detected the first radio signal from 3I/ATLAS on October 24, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected the first radio signal from 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it is a comet losing water.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2025, the Nordic Optical Telescope captured images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing that it did not disintegrate during its perihelion passage.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb presented his findings and theories about the comet’s artificial nature following these observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The surface area required to account for the mass flow in the large-scale jets... is untenable,” said Avi Loeb. “Given the solar power per unit area, the jets require an object larger than Manhattan Island.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The fact that 3I/ATLAS did not disintegrate is exactly in-line with what I expected to happen,” said Michigan State University astronomy professor Darryl Seligman.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the second interstellar object detected in our solar system. Previous observations have raised questions about its composition and behavior, leading to debates about its origins. The recent detection of radio absorption lines by hydroxyl radicals further supports the hypothesis that it is a natural comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to better understand its characteristics and origins. Further observations and analyses are expected as the comet becomes more visible from Earth.</p>
