      <h2>Rare comet 3I/Atlas approaches Earth, now within 300 million km, sparking new studies and global space updates</h2>

<p>A rare comet named 3I/Atlas is currently approaching Earth, located just over 300 million kilometres away. This comet, which originates from another star system, has garnered attention from scientists worldwide as it moves closer to our planet.</p>

<p>Authorities and space agencies are actively monitoring 3I/Atlas as it provides a unique opportunity for astronomical study. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth at approximately 269 million kilometres in mid-December 2025. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have deployed multiple spacecraft to observe and capture data on the comet, generating new images and updates almost daily.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas is currently over 300 million km from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet will come closest to Earth at about 269 million km in December 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's spacecraft near Mars photographed the comet from 29 million km away.</li>
    <li>ESA satellites are also observing the comet from Mars’ orbit.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres wide.</li>
    <li>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to observe the comet in the coming weeks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been observed by various spacecraft as it approaches Earth. Recently, NASA spacecraft near Mars captured images of the comet from a distance of 29 million kilometres. ESA satellites have also been tracking the comet from Mars’ orbit. The comet will continue to be monitored by both NASA and ESA until it reaches its closest point in December 2025.</p>

<blockquote>“Everyone who has a telescope wants to look at it because it’s a very rare chance,” said NASA’s acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is unique as it is not part of our Solar System. Its origins suggest it may provide insights into the early days of the galaxy. NASA scientists believe studying this comet can enhance our understanding of celestial objects that travel between stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its journey, scientists will maintain close observation. They aim to gather more data and insights, making the most of this rare opportunity to study an interstellar object.</p>
