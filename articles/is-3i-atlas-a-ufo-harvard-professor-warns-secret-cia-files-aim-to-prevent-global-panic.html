      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS a UFO? Harvard Professor Warns Secret CIA Files Aim to Prevent Global Panic</h2>

<p>On July 1, 2025, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS entered our solar system, as observed by the Rio Hurtado observatory in Chile. NASA scientists reported that the comet was traveling at a record-breaking speed of 137,000 miles per hour, the fastest speed ever recorded for a visitor of its kind. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This matter has garnered attention due to the contrasting responses from NASA and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is "definitely a comet of natural origin," while the CIA has remained silent regarding its monitoring of the object, leading to concerns about potential government secrecy and public panic.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS flew into the solar system on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observed by the Rio Hurtado observatory in Chile.</li>
    <li>Traveling at 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Closest point to Earth was on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 167 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed the comet's natural origin on November 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>CIA responded to a FOIA request on December 31, 2025, stating they could neither confirm nor deny records related to 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS entered the solar system. NASA scientists monitored the comet's trajectory and reported its unprecedented speed. On November 19, 2025, NASA confirmed that the object is of natural origin. Following this, on December 31, 2025, the CIA responded to a FOIA request from John Greenewald Jr., stating the existence of records related to 3I/ATLAS is classified.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The simplest interpretation of the CIA response to the FOIA request is that some government officials wished to verify that 3I/ATLAS is not a black swan event, posing a potential threat to society.”</blockquote>
<p>Avi Loeb, Baird Professor of Science at Harvard University, made this comment in an article published on Medium.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CIA's refusal to provide information contrasts sharply with NASA's transparent communication. Loeb has drawn parallels to past intelligence oversights, such as the failures leading up to the events of September 11, 2001, and October 7, 2023. He suggests that the CIA's approach may be aimed at preventing societal unrest and financial instability.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, there are currently no announced investigations or further actions from the CIA regarding the object. NASA will likely continue monitoring its trajectory, while the broader implications of the CIA's secrecy remain a topic of discussion among scientists and intelligence officials.</p>
