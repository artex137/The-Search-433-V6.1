      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is photographed by the Chinese probe Tianwen-1 in an unprecedented feat near Mars</h2>

<p>The Chinese probe Tianwen-1 has captured high-resolution images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS while orbiting Mars in October 2025, marking a significant milestone in space exploration. This event is the first time an interstellar object has been observed and photographed from another planet, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA).</p>

<p>This achievement is notable for planetary science and modern astronomy, as it allows scientists to study the composition and trajectory of celestial visitors from outside the Solar System. Various space agencies have collaborated to gather and analyze data from this rare cosmic object, enhancing our understanding of its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was photographed at approximately 30 million kilometers from Mars.</li>
    <li>The imaging was conducted by the Chinese probe Tianwen-1 in October 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is about 5.6 kilometers wide and travels at a speed of 58 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Multiple space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), collaborated in the observation.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma exhibited a diameter of thousands of kilometers and a tail that extended approximately 56,000 kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, Tianwen-1 successfully captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS. The probe, originally designed to map the surface of Mars, adapted its instruments to track the fast-moving comet. Extensive simulations were conducted to ensure high-quality images were obtained despite the challenges posed by the comet's speed.</p>

<p>The images were processed in Beijing, revealing details about the comet's structure and confirming China's capabilities in deep space tracking operations. Data collected during this observation has been shared with the global scientific community for further analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This successful observation reinforces our understanding of interstellar objects and their significance in studying planetary formation,” said a spokesperson from CNSA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its sharp hyperbolic orbit indicates that it is not bound to our solar system. This observation contributes to ongoing research into the chemistry and physics of celestial bodies from different stellar neighborhoods.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the data collected from the observation is expected to continue, with scientists aiming to refine models of the comet's composition and behavior. Collaborative efforts among international space agencies will likely enhance our understanding of such interstellar objects.</p>
