      <h2>NASA’s Webb Spots a Carbon Dioxide Heavy Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has observed comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object, on August 6, 2025. The comet, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii, exhibits a coma dominated by carbon dioxide, suggesting it formed under different cosmic conditions than typical Solar System comets.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insights into the composition of interstellar objects and the conditions present during their formation. NASA plans to continue monitoring the comet as it approaches the Sun, where additional changes to its chemical composition may occur.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Date:</strong> August 6, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Size:</strong> Less than 2.8 kilometers in radius</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>CO2-to-H2O Ratio:</strong> 8 ± 1</li>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Estimated between 3 to 11 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS survey in Hawaii first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope conducted observations on August 6, 2025, using its Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) to analyze the comet's coma. The exposure lasted 640 seconds, capturing a spectrum between 0.6 and 5.3 microns, revealing a high carbon dioxide-to-water ratio.</p>

<p>As the comet continues its hyperbolic trajectory through the Solar System, further observations will be made to study how its composition changes as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk,” said Martin Cordiner, lead author from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is unique compared to typical comets in the Solar System, which are usually dominated by water. The findings suggest this comet may have originated in a region rich in frozen carbon dioxide or that its surface has been altered over billions of years in interstellar space.</p>

<p>This discovery parallels earlier observations of interstellar objects, such as 1I/’Oumuamua, which also presented puzzling characteristics that challenged existing theories about comet formation and composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will use the Hubble Space Telescope and the new SPHEREx mission to continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. These observations will help determine if the comet's high carbon dioxide content is a permanent feature or if hidden water ice will become evident as it gets closer to the Sun.</p>
