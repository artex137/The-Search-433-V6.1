      <h2>Leaked documents reveal secret US monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS for more than 20 years in planetary defense program</h2>

<p>Leaked documents indicate that the United States has been secretly monitoring the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS for over 20 years as part of a classified planetary defense program known as Cassandra. The comet, publicly discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, has been tracked by advanced satellites since the early 2000s. The comet passed its closest point to the Sun (perihelion) on December 10, 2025, approximately 1.8 astronomical units from the Sun, and is expected to reach its minimum distance from Earth in January 2026.</p>

<p>The monitoring of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it aims to enhance the understanding of interstellar objects and improve planetary defense strategies. NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no risk to Earth, currently remaining more than 270 million kilometers away. The Cassandra program, proposed in 2005, integrates various satellite systems to ensure continuous tracking and analysis of near-Earth objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025 by ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on December 10, 2025.</li>
    <li>Minimum distance from Earth expected in January 2026.</li>
    <li>Current distance from Earth is over 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet travels at approximately 246,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Core diameter estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Program Cassandra has monitored interstellar objects since 2017.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s, the US began monitoring interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as part of the classified Cassandra program. The comet was publicly discovered in July 2025. It passed perihelion on December 10, 2025, and will reach its closest approach to Earth in January 2026. Observations from various satellites and telescopes have captured significant data about the comet's characteristics.</p>

<p>Notably, the comet exhibited unusual geometric patterns in its plasma tail and jets directed towards the Sun. The monitoring has included the use of satellites such as Argus-Vis and Umbra, which provided high-resolution data during perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS does not pose a threat, but serves to improve astrometry techniques on comets with atypical behavior,” NASA stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Cassandra program has prioritized the monitoring of interstellar objects since the passage of Oumuamua in 2017. This initiative aims to prepare for future objects that may pose risks to Earth. The monitoring of 3I/ATLAS contributes to refining planetary defense models and enhancing global collaboration among space agencies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Agencies plan to conduct a full analysis of 3I/ATLAS by February 2026, which will include detailed composition studies and implications for space surveillance efforts. Ground-based and orbital observatories will continue to collect data on the comet's brightness and emissions during its approach.</p>
