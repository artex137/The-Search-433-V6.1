      <h2>3I/ATLAS Is 'Strange Because It Was Forged Under Alien Conditions', Experts Say</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has provided scientists with a unique glimpse into the chemistry of alien worlds since its discovery on July 1, 2025. NASA and its partners confirmed on December 10, 2025, that the comet contains essential organic molecules, which has significant implications for astrobiology. The comet is expected to pass Earth safely on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 1.8 astronomical units, or roughly 170 million miles (270 million km).</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it supports the long-held theory that comets may have delivered vital ingredients for life to young planets, including Earth. As observatories worldwide strive to capture more data before the comet speeds away, researchers hope to analyze the chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS to better understand the origins of life in the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 170 million miles)</li>
    <li>Speed at closest approach: 153,000 mph (246,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Size: Between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres across</li>
    <li>Confirmed organic molecules: Methanol and hydrogen cyanide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has since been on a hyperbolic trajectory through the inner solar system. On December 10, 2025, NASA confirmed the presence of organic molecules in the comet's composition, marking a significant moment for astrobiology. The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>Observatories have employed various instruments to capture data, including Hubble, the Perseverance rover on Mars, and the XRISM X-ray observatory, which detected a faint X-ray glow around the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS carries no life itself, but the data strongly supports the theory that comets may have seeded young planets with the vital organic molecules necessary for life's emergence,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It is simply strange because of where it came from,” added a researcher involved in the study of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed passing through our solar system, following Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. Its chemical composition, particularly its high levels of methanol and hydrogen cyanide, sets it apart from typical solar-system comets, which may provide insights into the formation of other planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, scientists anticipate a massive downlink of data from ESA's Juice spacecraft in February 2026. This data will contribute to a comprehensive analysis of the comet, offering insights into the building blocks of worlds beyond our solar system.</p>
