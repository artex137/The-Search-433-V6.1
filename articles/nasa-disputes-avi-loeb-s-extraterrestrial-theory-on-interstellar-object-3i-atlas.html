      <h2>NASA Disputes Avi Loeb’s Extraterrestrial Theory on Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has challenged the theory proposed by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb regarding the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered in early July 2023. This object is only the third interstellar visitor detected in our solar system, and Loeb has suggested that it could be a deliberate probe sent by an extraterrestrial civilization. However, NASA scientists maintain it is more likely a comet, a body of ice and dust that emits material as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>This debate is significant as it highlights differing views within the scientific community about the nature of interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial life. NASA has emphasized the need for consensus based on observable data while acknowledging the intriguing characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>Only the third interstellar visitor detected in the solar system.</li>
    <li>Tom Statler is NASA's lead scientist for solar system small bodies.</li>
    <li>Loeb has previously suggested that 'Oumuamua may be of alien origin.</li>
    <li>Loeb has recognized the possibility that 3I/ATLAS is a comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July 2023, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS, marking its entry into the solar system. Avi Loeb proposed a theory suggesting that the object could be an extraterrestrial probe. NASA scientists, led by Tom Statler, responded by asserting that the object resembles a comet, citing its behavior and physical properties. Loeb later acknowledged the possibility of 3I/ATLAS being a comet while continuing to advocate for open-mindedness in scientific exploration.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for solar system small bodies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Not only is nature more imaginative than we are, but it also does not care whether we figure it out,” stated Avi Loeb, emphasizing the need for openness in scientific inquiry.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS and 'Oumuamua has sparked ongoing discussions within the scientific community about the nature of such phenomena and the potential for extraterrestrial life. While only three interstellar visitors have been identified to date, Statler believes advancements in technology have improved detection capabilities, suggesting that such objects may not be rare.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to study 3I/ATLAS and its characteristics, contributing to the broader understanding of interstellar objects. Discussions within the scientific community about the implications of these discoveries are expected to evolve as new data becomes available.</p>
