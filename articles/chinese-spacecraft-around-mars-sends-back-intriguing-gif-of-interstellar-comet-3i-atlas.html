      <h2>Chinese Spacecraft Around Mars Sends Back Intriguing Gif Of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>China's Tianwen-1 orbiter has transmitted images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, taken from its orbit around Mars. The images were received after the orbiter successfully captured the comet's features, including its nucleus and coma. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first time Tianwen-1 has photographed such a distant and dim target. Astronomers aim to study the comet's properties to gain insights into the environment from which it originated. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has confirmed that this event enhances our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tianwen-1 orbiter launched in February 2021.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2023, moving at approximately <strong>58 kilometers per second</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following <strong>1I/ʻOumuamua</strong> and <strong>2I/Borisov</strong>.</li>
    <li>Images show the comet's nucleus and its coma, which can reach several thousand kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet was previously out of view from Earth as it traveled behind the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) detected 3I/ATLAS moving through the Solar System. The comet was later obscured from Earth-based telescopes as it passed behind the Sun. During this time, images were captured by the European Space Agency's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter.</p>

<p>Recently, the Tianwen-1 orbiter transmitted its own images of the comet, showcasing its unique features. The images highlight the comet's nucleus and coma, indicating the object’s ongoing activity and changes in its trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was the first attempt to photograph such a distant and relatively dim target (10,000 to 100,000 times dimmer than targets on the Martian surface),” the CNSA stated.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Based on this observational data, researchers are conducting further in-depth studies of ATLAS,” the CNSA added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects that have been observed since the detection of <strong>1I/ʻOumuamua</strong> in 2017. The study of such objects provides valuable insights into the composition and dynamics of celestial bodies from outside our Solar System. The ongoing research into 3I/ATLAS may reveal more about the conditions in which it formed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS is now visible again from Earth, astronomers are refocusing their telescopes on the comet. New observations are expected soon, potentially from the European Space Agency’s JUICE orbiter, which is en route to Jupiter.</p>
