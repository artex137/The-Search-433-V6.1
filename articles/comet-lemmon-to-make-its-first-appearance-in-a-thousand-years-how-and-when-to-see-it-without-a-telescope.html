      <h2>Comet Lemmon to Make Its First Appearance in a Thousand Years</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 A6, known as Comet Lemmon, has started to become visible in the night sky and will reach its peak brightness between October 25 and 31, 2025. The comet will be closest to Earth on October 21, 2025, and is expected to be visible to the naked eye in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>This event marks a rare opportunity for stargazers, as Comet Lemmon has not been seen for a thousand years. Experts encourage the public to take advantage of this spectacle, highlighting the unique experience of observing a comet with minimal equipment.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> C/2025 A6 (Comet Lemmon)</li>
    <li><strong>Peak Visibility:</strong> October 25 to 31, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> October 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Best Viewing Times:</strong> Dusk and one hour after sunset</li>
    <li><strong>Optimal Viewing Conditions:</strong> Dark locations away from city lights</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October 2025, Comet Lemmon began to illuminate the sky. By mid-October, it became bright enough to be visible with the naked eye. The comet will be at its closest to Earth on October 21, followed by its peak brightness from October 25 to 31.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If Comet Lemmon continues its current trend of brightness, it could become a stunning sight to behold with the naked eye in the coming weeks,” experts have said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon represents a once-in-a-millennium event, as it has not passed through the inner solar system for a thousand years. Such occurrences provide valuable opportunities for scientific observation and public engagement with astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
