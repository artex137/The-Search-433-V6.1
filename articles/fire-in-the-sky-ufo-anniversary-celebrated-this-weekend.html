<p>The gathering marks the 50th anniversary of the Travis Walton incident, one of the most famous UFO abduction stories. It aims to bring together believers and skeptics for a day of activities, including lectures, tours, and entertainment.

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 5, 1975, Travis Walton stepped out of a truck in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and approached a strange craft, where he was reportedly struck by a beam of light. His crewmates witnessed the event and later reported Walton missing. He resurfaced on November 10, 1975, after a five-day search.</p>
<p>The incident sparked a national media frenzy and multiple investigations, including polygraph tests for Walton and his crewmates, all of whom reportedly passed. The story has since inspired documentaries, books, and the 1993 film “Fire in the Sky.”</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There’s a lot to look forward to,” says Walton. “People that are personally involved with me and are familiar with my case can mingle and associate with people like that.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Well, if there’s a division, I would say that the naysayers were more outspoken early on, and now they tend to remain silent because the supporters are much more willing to confront them about their doubts,” Walton adds.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Travis Walton incident remains a controversial subject, with skeptics suggesting it could have been fabricated. The small town of Heber has become a notable destination for UFO tourism, with local businesses capitalizing on the event's legacy.</p>
<p>Walton's story has led to ongoing discussions about the nature of UFO sightings and abduction claims, as well as the public's fascination with extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
