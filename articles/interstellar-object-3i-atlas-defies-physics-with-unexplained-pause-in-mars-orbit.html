      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/Atlas defies physics with unexplained pause in Mars’ orbit</h2>

<p>An unprecedented astronomical event has mobilized the global scientific community as the interstellar object 3I/Atlas, the third of its kind identified in the Solar System, performed a maneuver that defies known laws of physics. The object came to an almost complete stop in the vicinity of Mars during October 2025, remaining motionless for several days before resuming its trajectory.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it challenges current understandings of orbital mechanics and has prompted scientists to analyze data collected during the object's pause. Researchers from multiple agencies, including NASA, are working to decipher the forces that could have caused this temporary immobility, a phenomenon never before observed in a body with a hyperbolic trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Object identified as 3I/Atlas.</li>
    <li>Object paused near Mars for several days.</li>
    <li>Confirmed by multiple NASA instruments, including telescopes and probes.</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter of 320 meters to 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Estimated age of 10 billion years, older than the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, 3I/Atlas entered the vicinity of Mars. During this time, scientists observed the object coming to a near-complete stop, a behavior not predicted by existing models of orbital mechanics. The object's immobility lasted for several days, after which it resumed its journey through the Solar System.</p>
<p>Data collection occurred simultaneously, with multiple NASA probes and telescopes capturing high-resolution information during this rare event. The data is currently under analysis by scientific teams worldwide.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The immobility of 3I/Atlas represents a direct challenge to the principles of orbital mechanics,” said a NASA spokesperson. “We are dedicated to analyzing the forces behind this unprecedented behavior.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior interstellar visitors like ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov exhibited subtle accelerations, but 3I/Atlas showed a drastic slowdown. The event highlights gaps in current orbital simulation software, which primarily relies on gravitational interactions. The behavior of 3I/Atlas underscores the need for updates to these models to include complex electromagnetic interactions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientific teams will continue to analyze the data collected during the event. The findings could lead to new discoveries in the understanding of celestial bodies formed in different stellar systems and the fundamental interactions that govern the universe. Projections indicate that 3I/Atlas will reach its perihelion near the Sun on October 29, 2025, before continuing its journey past Venus in November 2025 and Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
