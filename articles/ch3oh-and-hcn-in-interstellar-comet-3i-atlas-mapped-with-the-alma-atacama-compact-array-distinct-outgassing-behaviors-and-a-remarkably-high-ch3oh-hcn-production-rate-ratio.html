      <h2>Headline: CH3OH and HCN in Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Mapped with the ALMA Atacama Compact Array: Distinct Outgassing Behaviors and a Remarkably High CH3OH/HCN Production Rate Ratio</h2>

<p>Researchers have detected methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) on various dates in 2025, including August 28, September 12, 15, and 18, and October 1. The observations took place at heliocentric distances of 2.6 to 1.7 astronomical units (au) from the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it reveals distinct outgassing patterns for the two molecules. According to the report, HCN production is notably depleted in the sunward hemisphere of the comet's coma, while CH<sub>3</sub>OH shows enhanced production in that direction. The findings contribute to understanding the chemical composition and behavior of comets as they approach the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) detected on August 28, September 18, 22, and October 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) detected on September 12 and 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations occurred at heliocentric distances of 2.6 to 1.7 au.</li>
    <li>CH<sub>3</sub>OH/HCN production rate ratios recorded at 124+30−34 (September 12) and 79+11−14 (September 15).</li>
    <li>Research conducted by a team led by Nathan X. Roth and includes multiple co-authors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 28, 2025, researchers began observing comet 3I/ATLAS, focusing on the presence of methanol. They continued their observations on September 12 and 15, detecting hydrogen cyanide. Further observations of methanol occurred on September 18 and 22, as well as October 1.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis indicated that CH<sub>3</sub>OH production originates from coma sources, while HCN appears to result from direct nucleus sublimation. The CH<sub>3</sub>OH production rate exhibited a sharp increase from August through October, particularly near the H<sub>2</sub>O sublimation zone.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The derived CH<sub>3</sub>OH/HCN ratios in 3I/ATLAS are among the most enriched values measured in any comet,” said Nathan X. Roth, one of the lead researchers.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This research builds on previous studies of comets, which have explored their chemical compositions and behaviors. The findings about 3I/ATLAS contribute to a growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar comets and their outgassing behaviors, which can inform theories about the formation of the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations may focus on the implications of these findings for understanding the origins of organic molecules in the solar system. Researchers plan to analyze additional data as comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey.</p>
