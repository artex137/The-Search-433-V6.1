      <h2>U.S. Congress Reveals Video of Missile Striking Unfazed UFO</h2>

<p>During a U.S. Congressional hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) on October 30, 2024, lawmakers presented footage showing an orb-like object off the coast of Yemen that appeared unaffected by a missile strike. The video, recorded by an MQ-9 drone, is part of ongoing investigations into UAPs and has sparked discussions on government transparency.</p>

<p>This revelation has prompted calls for more government accountability regarding UAP-related information. Representative Anna Paulina Luna of Florida highlighted the need to address government cover-ups and deliver answers to the public. The video has raised questions about the extent of undisclosed information within government archives.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, the U.S. Congressional hearing focused on UAPs included the presentation of shocking footage showing a missile striking an orb-like object. The video, filmed by an MQ-9 drone, depicted the missile's impact without any visible effect on the object.</p>
<p>During the hearing, U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins provided a testimony about a 2023 encounter with UAPs, describing an experience that defied conventional understanding of aviation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That’s a hellfire missile smacking into that UFO, and bouncing right off—and it kept going,” said UAP journalist George Knapp, commenting on the video.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It kept going, and it looked like the debris was taken with it,” stated Representative Eric Burlison, who facilitated the video's release.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I am here to provide a firsthand account of what I saw, what our systems recorded, and why it matters for safety, for intelligence, and public confidence,” said Alexandro Wiggins regarding his encounter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The federal government has been hiding information from Americans for decades,” Representative Luna articulated, reflecting a widespread sentiment.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing is part of a broader discussion on the U.S. government's approach to UAPs and the withholding of critical information. Representative Luna's comments echo a bipartisan task force's goal to uncover truths about UAPs and other significant government secrets, including sensitive materials related to past events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress plans to continue its investigations into UAPs, focusing on transparency and accountability. The release of the missile footage is expected to lead to further inquiries into the government's handling of UAP-related information.</p>
