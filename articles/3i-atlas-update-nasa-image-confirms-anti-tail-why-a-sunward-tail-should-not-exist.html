      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: NASA Image Confirms Anti-Tail, Why A Sunward Tail Should Not Exist</h2>

<p>A new image from the Hubble Space Telescope, taken on November 30, 2025, has confirmed the presence of an unexpected feature known as an anti-tail on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. The image reveals a structured plume of debris extending towards the Sun, defying conventional cometary physics, according to NASA officials.</p>

<p>This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of cometary behaviour. The appearance of the anti-tail challenges existing models and raises questions about the composition and movement of interstellar objects. Researchers are now closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with December 19, 2025, marking a key date for further observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of Hubble image: November 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Anti-tail extension: approximately 60,000 kilometres towards the Sun</li>
    <li>Notable researcher: Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li>Close approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed since its discovery, with its closest approach to the Sun occurring prior to November 30, 2025. The Hubble Space Telescope captured the latest image, which has prompted further investigation into the object's unusual characteristics.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the December 19 close approach, astronomers will focus on high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy to gather more data about the object's behaviour as it cools.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The alignment between our predictions and the observations from Hubble is extraordinary. We are witnessing a consistent behaviour that challenges our understanding of interstellar objects."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS is unprecedented compared to typical comets, which usually exhibit chaotic motions and unstable tails. Previous studies have documented anomalies in comet behaviour, but 3I/ATLAS presents a unique case that could reshape theories in astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will conduct detailed observations to determine if the anti-tail continues to behave coherently and to explore the object's composition. The findings could provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects and their interactions with solar forces.</p>
