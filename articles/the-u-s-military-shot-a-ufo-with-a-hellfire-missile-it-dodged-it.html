      <h2>The U.S. Military Shot a UFO With a Hellfire Missile. It Dodged It.</h2>

<p>The U.S. military has attempted to destroy a mysterious flying orb with a Hellfire missile during operations off the coast of Yemen in October 2024, but the missile failed to impact the object, according to a congressional hearing held on September 9. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the incident.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights ongoing congressional interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). Lawmakers are pushing for transparency regarding military engagements with such objects, especially after the missile strike’s ineffectiveness raised questions about the nature of the orb.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in October 2024.</li>
    <li>Location: off the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>Weapon used: Hellfire missile from an MQ-9 Reaper drone.</li>
    <li>Missile strike was part of U.S. operations against Houthi rebels.</li>
    <li>Congressional hearing took place on September 9, 2024.</li>
    <li>Testimony included assertions from journalists, veterans, and military insiders.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2024, during military operations against Houthi rebels, an MQ-9 Reaper drone engaged a metallic, spherical UAP with a Hellfire missile. Despite the missile striking the orb, it reportedly did not cause any damage, leading to a bizarre reaction from the object.</p>

<p>On September 9, 2024, a congressional hearing revealed footage of the incident, which was leaked to Rep. Eric Burlison by an anonymous whistleblower. The hearing was the third in recent years focused on UAPs, indicating a growing legislative concern over these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Greenlight given to engage,” Burlison posted on X, “missile appears to be ineffective.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, head of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, called for transparency, stating that Americans deserve to know why our most advanced weapons bounced off of its target instead of obliterating it.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident represents a shift in the U.S. government's approach to UAPs, moving from a dismissive attitude to recognizing them as serious matters of national security. The term "UAP" replaces the outdated "UFO," which has been historically associated with alien encounters. The ongoing congressional hearings reflect increased scrutiny and interest in classified military operations related to these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue its investigations into UAP incidents, including examining military protocols and the potential need for greater transparency regarding engagements with unidentified objects.</p>
