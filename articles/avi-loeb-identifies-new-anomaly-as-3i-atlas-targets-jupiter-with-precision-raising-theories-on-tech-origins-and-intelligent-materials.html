      <h2>Avi Loeb Identifies New Anomaly As 3I/ATLAS Targets Jupiter With Precision Raising Theories on Tech Origins and Intelligent Materials</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has identified a remarkable anomaly in the trajectory of comet 3I/ATLAS, which is set to pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026. The comet has shown signs of a precise course correction that suggests intentionality, according to Loeb's analysis published on Medium.</p>

<p>This discovery raises important questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential origins. As scientists analyze this phenomenon, they are considering the implications of technological intervention and the possibility that the comet may contain ancient materials that could offer insights into the origins of life and intelligence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Close Approach Date:</strong> March 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum Distance from Jupiter:</strong> 53.445 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Hill Radius of Jupiter:</strong> 53.5 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Gravitational Acceleration:</strong> 5×10<sup>-7</sup> astronomical units per day squared</li>
    <li><strong>Probability of Trajectory Alignment:</strong> One-in-26,000 chance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered racing through our solar system; its trajectory has been closely monitored by scientists. During its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, the comet exhibited unexpected non-gravitational acceleration. This acceleration altered its path, aligning it closely with Jupiter's Hill radius.</p>
<p>On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS is expected to brush past Jupiter at a distance that matches the Hill radius, suggesting that the comet's trajectory has been finely tuned.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Let us suppose, hypothetically, that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a mothership that was designed to seed Jupiter with technological devices.” 
    <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “In other words, the non-gravitational acceleration introduced a small course correction of exactly the magnitude needed to bring the minimum distance of 3I/ATLAS from Jupiter to the value of Jupiter’s Hill radius.” 
    <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This anomaly marks a significant moment in the study of interstellar objects. Researchers are increasingly interested in the materials that comets like 3I/ATLAS carry, as they may hold clues to the origins of life and the universe. Previous studies have suggested that such comets can contain primordial materials that date back billions of years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As astronomers continue to gather data on 3I/ATLAS and its approach to Jupiter, they will look for signs of new orbiters or technological devices that may have been deployed during its passage. Further observations could provide critical insights into both the comet's behavior and the materials it carries.</p>
