      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Returns: See The 'Visitor Older Than Our Sun' Over Egypt</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has revealed a faint X-ray cloud surrounding it, over Egypt's Black Desert. The comet, estimated to be over seven billion years old, made its latest appearance visible to telescopes in late October 2025 and will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing scientific understanding of comet behavior. The X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), a collaboration between Japan's JAXA, NASA, and the European Space Agency (ESA), captured the X-ray glow between November 26 and November 28, 2025. Researchers are racing to understand the implications of this finding before the comet exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is over seven billion years old.</li>
    <li>The X-ray halo extends approximately 400,000 kilometres around the comet.</li>
    <li>XRISM detected the X-ray glow from November 26-28, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in July 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile in July 2025. Researchers identified it as an interstellar visitor due to its high velocity. The comet re-emerged from behind the Sun in late October 2025, becoming visible to Earth-based telescopes once again. The X-ray glow was detected by XRISM between November 26 and November 28, 2025.</p>
<p>The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, before continuing on its trajectory out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The faint but real glow spanning several hundred thousand miles has been detected,” said the XRISM team, noting that they are still working to understand the full implications of this discovery.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Prior observations of comets within our solar system have shown X-ray emissions typically resulting from solar wind reactions. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its chemical composition and behavior, are prompting researchers to reconsider existing models of comet formation and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are prioritizing data processing to confirm the structure and source of the X-ray glow before the comet leaves the solar system. Understanding how the comet's gas interacts with the solar wind is crucial for future studies of interstellar matter.</p>
