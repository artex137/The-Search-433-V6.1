      <h2>Baba Vanga Predictions: 3I/ATLAS Sparks Alien Theories and Prophecy Buzz Despite NASA’s Assurance</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2025. While scientists classify it as a comet, speculation about its origin has led some to suggest it could be an alien spacecraft. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>This event has generated significant public interest, especially in light of predictions from the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, who forecast human contact with extraterrestrial life in 2025. NASA has assured the public that the comet poses no danger to Earth, as it will pass at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA predicts it will pass approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometres) from Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope.</li>
    <li>The comet will not pose any risk of impact with Earth.</li>
    <li>New images captured by the Nordic Optical Telescope in September show changes in the comet's tail.</li>
    <li>Human-made spacecraft, including ESA's Hera and NASA's Europa Clipper, may collect data from its ion tail between October 25 and November 6.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope. In September, the Nordic Optical Telescope in Spain captured new images of the comet, revealing unexpected changes in its tail. The comet is set to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</p>
<p>Between October 25 and November 6, several spacecraft in orbit may intersect with the comet's ion tail, creating opportunities for data collection.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “NASA has confirmed there is no risk of impact and that the comet's passage provides a valuable opportunity to study material from beyond our Solar System,” a NASA spokesperson said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is unlike any comet ever seen,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. “It shows eight unique anomalies, including its nickel-rich gas composition and its alignment with the famous Wow! Signal detected in 1977.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Baba Vanga, who passed away decades ago, has gained renewed attention for her predictions regarding extraterrestrial contact in 2025. While her forecasts have sparked public interest, there is currently no credible evidence linking her predictions to 3I/ATLAS. The comet’s unique characteristics have also led to discussions among scientists about its possible origins, though NASA maintains it is a natural comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, scientists will continue to monitor its behaviour. Data collected by spacecraft may provide insights into the comet's composition and path, while public interest in its potential extraterrestrial implications is expected to grow.</p>
