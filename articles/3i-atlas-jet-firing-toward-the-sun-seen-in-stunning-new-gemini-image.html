      <h2>3I/ATLAS: 'Jet Firing Toward The Sun' Seen In Stunning New Gemini Image</h2>

<p>Tonight, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has re-emerged from behind the Sun, offering a new opportunity for both professional and amateur astronomers to observe it. The comet is now visible just before dawn, as Earth rotates, allowing telescopes worldwide to document its features continuously.</p>

<p>This observation window is significant because it marks the first time since 3I/ATLAS slipped behind the Sun's brightness that astronomers can capture clear images. Researchers aim to gather detailed data on the comet's brightness, tail geometry, rotation, and potential fragmentation. The next 33 days are critical, leading up to the comet's closest approach to Earth on December 19.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is currently located just above the eastern horizon in the constellation Virgo.</li>
  <li>The comet has a magnitude of +10.9, making it invisible to the naked eye.</li>
  <li>The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a public livestream starting at 11:15 p.m. ET on November 16 (0415 GMT on November 17).</li>
  <li>Observations will continue until December 19, when the comet reaches its closest approach to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has cleared the solar glare, allowing for renewed observation from Earth. The Virtual Telescope Project has scheduled a livestream to capture real-time views of the comet as it accelerates away from the Sun.</p>
<p>This observation period will enable researchers to document changes in the comet's brightness and tail structure over the coming weeks. The data collected will contribute to understanding interstellar objects and may refine planetary defence strategies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  "3I/ATLAS has now cleared the solar glare, and we are once again able to observe it from Earth. This is the moment astronomers have been waiting for," said Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of several interstellar visitors studied by astronomers, following noteworthy objects such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These past encounters have raised questions about the origins and characteristics of such celestial bodies, making the study of 3I/ATLAS particularly important.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the observation period unfolds, astronomers will rely on a global network of telescopes to gather data. The collaboration among different observatories aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of 3I/ATLAS and its behaviour as it approaches Earth.</p>
