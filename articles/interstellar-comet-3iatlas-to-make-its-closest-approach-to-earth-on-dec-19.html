      <h2>Interstellar comet 3IATLAS to make its closest approach to Earth on Dec. 19</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3IATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. It will be approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) away, according to NASA. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This approach is significant for astronomers as they continue to gather data on the comet. However, the distance will not provide new insights beyond what is already known. Observations from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope have revealed limited information about the comet’s size and speed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 170 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus diameter: between 1,400 feet (440 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers)</li>
    <li>Speed: approximately 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 kilometers per hour)</li>
    <li>Initial detection: July 1, 2025, at 410 million miles (670 million kilometers) from the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3IATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, while it was 410 million miles away from the Sun. Since then, it has maintained a speed of approximately 137,000 miles per hour. As it approached the Sun, its speed increased to about 153,000 miles per hour before returning to its initial velocity. The comet is expected to exit the solar system after its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no prospect of it posing any danger to Earth,” NASA stated regarding the comet’s trajectory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3IATLAS is notable for being an interstellar object, which means it originated outside the solar system. Its observations contribute to the understanding of such celestial bodies, despite the limited data available due to its distance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, astronomers will continue to monitor 3IATLAS as it exits the solar system. Further observations may provide additional data, but significant new findings are not expected.</p>
