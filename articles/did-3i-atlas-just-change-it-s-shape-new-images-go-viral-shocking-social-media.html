      <h2>New Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS Spark Viral Speculation</h2>

<p>New images of Comet 3I/ATLAS have gone viral, showing the interstellar comet appearing to change shape from night to night. The images have generated significant excitement and speculation on social media platforms.</p>

<p>The viral post claims that the comet exhibits different appearances, ranging from a smooth disc to a bright, active form with jets and tails. While some observers have suggested that these variations indicate a shape-shifting phenomenon, scientists caution that the changes are likely due to normal comet behavior influenced by various factors. Authorities and astronomers have been monitoring the comet closely to provide clarity on its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope network.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Recent observations suggest the comet's coma is dominated by carbon dioxide, water vapour, and carbon monoxide.</li>
    <li>Changes in appearance attributed to outgassing and viewing conditions, not shape-shifting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers detected Comet 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS survey telescope network. Since then, amateur astrophotographers have been tracking the comet, noting variations in its appearance. In recent weeks, images shared on social media have fueled speculation regarding the comet's shape and behavior.</p>

<p>On various evenings, observers reported seeing 3I/ATLAS as a simple disc, while on other nights, it appeared to display multiple glowing jets and a bright coma. The changes in appearance prompted discussions about the nature of the comet and theories about its origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The perceived changes in shape and appearance are consistent with known comet behaviours, influenced by outgassing, changing dust and gas emissions, viewing geometry, and solar radiation effects,” said astronomers from Space.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “What looked like a red dust-dominated coma changed to a blue-green coma dominated by gas emission, a common phenomenon in active comets,” explained a postdoctoral researcher at the Lowell Observatory.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor, which has heightened public interest and speculation. Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also sparked intrigue and theories about their origins and characteristics.</p>

<p>Research indicates that changes in the appearance of comets are often misinterpreted, leading to conspiracy theories and sensational claims. Scientists emphasize that variations are typically the result of natural phenomena rather than extraordinary transformations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and astronomers will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. Ongoing studies aim to enhance understanding of its behavior and characteristics, providing clearer insights into the nature of this interstellar visitor.</p>
