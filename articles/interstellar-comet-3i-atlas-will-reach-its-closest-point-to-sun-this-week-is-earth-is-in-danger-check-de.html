      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Closest Point to Sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, as it travels through our solar system. There are no injuries or fatalities reported related to the comet, which poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third known interstellar object detected passing through the solar system. Authorities, including NASA, are actively monitoring the comet to gather data that could enhance our ability to track future potentially hazardous objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet 3I/ATLAS</strong> was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus measures between <strong>1,444 feet</strong> and <strong>3.5 miles</strong> in diameter.</li>
    <li>It will not come closer than <strong>170 million miles</strong> to Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at approximately <strong>137,000 miles per hour</strong>.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the Sun occurs on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet is on a <strong>hyperbolic trajectory</strong> and will not follow a typical orbit.</li>
    <li>The campaign to observe the comet is coordinated by NASA and involves smaller telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, during routine observations by the ATLAS survey. Subsequent analysis revealed that it had been observed previously as early as June 14, 2025. NASA has coordinated a project to monitor the comet's trajectory and speed, facilitating observations by the global astronomical community.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to reappear on the other side of the Sun by early December 2025, though it will not be visible without a telescope.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The newly found interstellar comet poses no dangerous threat to Earth. In fact, it won’t even come close to Earth,” NASA stated regarding the comet’s trajectory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This project will serve as a training ground to predict the orbit of 3I/ATLAS and perform astrometric measurements,” noted a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare and provide valuable insights into the formation of star systems. The scientific community views these objects as cosmic time capsules, offering potential chemical and physical information from billions of years ago. 3I/ATLAS is unique due to its rapid speed and hyperbolic trajectory, distinguishing it from typical comets that orbit the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the Minor Planet Center will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. The data collected will inform future observations of other comets and asteroids that could pose a risk to Earth.</p>
