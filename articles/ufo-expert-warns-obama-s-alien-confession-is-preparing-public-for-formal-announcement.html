      <h2>UFO expert warns Obama's 'alien confession' is preparing public for 'formal announcement'</h2>

<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama has suggested the existence of extraterrestrial life during a podcast interview with Brian Tyler Cohen, prompting speculation about a potential formal announcement regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). Obama stated, “They're real but I haven't seen them,” while distancing himself from claims that aliens are hidden within Area 51.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as UFO expert Nick Pope asserts that Obama's comments may signal an impending disclosure of classified information about UAP. Pope, who investigated UFOs for the UK's Ministry of Defence in the 1990s, believes this could be part of an effort to prepare the public for a significant revelation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Obama made comments about UFOs on a podcast on February 17, 2023.</li>
    <li>Nick Pope claims Obama's statements may lead to an official announcement on UAP.</li>
    <li>Former intelligence official David Grusch has stated the U.S. has recovered "intact and partially intact" alien vehicles.</li>
    <li>Mark Christopher Lee suggests a potential UFO disclosure speech by former President Trump is planned for July 8, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 17, 2023, Barack Obama discussed the existence of aliens during an interview with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen. His remarks indicated a belief in extraterrestrial life, but he clarified that he saw no evidence of contact during his presidency. Following this, Nick Pope commented on the implications of Obama's statements for the UFO community.</p>
<p>In 2023, David Grusch, a former intelligence official, testified that the U.S. has recovered alien vehicles. Additionally, Mark Christopher Lee indicated that Trump may deliver a UFO disclosure speech on July 8, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Much of the UFO community has taken this as quasi-official confirmation of an extraterrestrial reality,” said Nick Pope, underscoring the significant impact of Obama's remarks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Obama’s comments are being seen as part of an acclimatisation campaign, readying people ahead of a definitive, formal announcement,” Pope added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That’s why there may be genuinely historic developments ahead from the current administration,” stated Mark Christopher Lee regarding potential future disclosures.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around UFOs has intensified in recent years, particularly following revelations from government officials about UAP. Previous presidents, including Ronald Reagan, have also reported sightings, fueling public interest and speculation. The ongoing debate about what governments may know regarding extraterrestrial life continues to captivate many.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP are ongoing, and the potential for a formal announcement remains uncertain. The upcoming planned speech by Trump on July 8 may provide further clarity on the government's stance regarding UFOs.</p>
