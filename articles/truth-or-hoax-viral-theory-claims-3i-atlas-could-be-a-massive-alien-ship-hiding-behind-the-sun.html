      <h2>Truth or Hoax? Viral Theory Claims 3I/Atlas Could Be a Massive Alien Ship Hiding Behind the Sun</h2>

<p>On October 21, 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will align perfectly with the Sun, entering a phase known as a 'solar conjunction' where it will be invisible to Earth-based telescopes. This event has sparked speculation about whether the comet could serve as a cover for a technological manoeuvre, though no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The significance of this alignment has prompted scientists and astronomers to monitor the comet closely. Authorities are preparing to gather data in November and December to determine if any unusual activity occurs as 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will enter solar conjunction on October 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is set for October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Close approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Juno spacecraft will observe 3I/ATLAS during its pass by Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft will closely observe 3I/ATLAS on November 4, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 21, 2025, 3I/ATLAS will begin its solar conjunction, becoming invisible to telescopes for several weeks. Eight days later, it will reach perihelion, where its velocity will peak, marking the optimal time for any potential manoeuvres. Observations will continue into November and December to detect any anomalies or deviations in its path.</p>

<p>On November 4, the European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft will conduct a close observation of the comet. Following this, 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and will pass by Jupiter on March 16, 2026, where further observations will take place.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Science demands evidence, and the answer to this question can be found by watching what happens next,” a source noted regarding the upcoming observations of 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>While the prevailing view among scientists is that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, its behaviour has raised questions. Notably, it exhibits several anomalies not typically associated with comets, such as an unusual composition and trajectory. This has led some experts, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, to suggest that alternative explanations should be considered.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As astronomers prepare for further observations in the coming months, they aim to gather evidence to clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS. The results from the JUICE and Juno spacecraft missions will be critical in determining whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural phenomenon or something more extraordinary.</p>
