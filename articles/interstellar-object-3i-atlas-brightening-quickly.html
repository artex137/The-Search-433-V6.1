      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS brightening quickly</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed brightening more quickly than anticipated as it approaches the sun, according to recent findings released on September 10, 2025. The comet, which was first identified in July 2025, is expected to pass Mars on October 3, 2025, at 4:00 UTC (11 p.m. CDT on October 2).</p>

<p>This rapid increase in brightness could mean a spectacular display as it nears Mars. Various space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency, plan to observe the comet during its close approach. Scientists aim to further understand the comet's origins and trajectory, which may provide insights into the formation of solar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First Observed:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Close Approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025, at 4:00 UTC</li>
    <li><strong>Current Speed:</strong> 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Diameter:</strong> 5.6 km (3.5 miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Brightening Observations:</strong> Mid-September 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. Initial size estimates placed its nucleus at about 20 km (12 miles) in diameter. By late July, this estimate was revised downward to 10 km (6 miles) using data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The latest analysis, based on Hubble Space Telescope data, has further reduced the estimated diameter to 5.6 km (3.5 miles).</p>

<p>By mid-September 2025, observations indicated that the comet was brightening at a rate faster than predicted. This change has prompted scientists to monitor its trajectory closely, especially as it prepares for its close encounter with Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“During the Mars close approach, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will observe 3I with HiRISE, observing between 1 – 4 a.m. on October 2,” said Marshall Eubanks of Space Initiatives.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object observed in our solar system, indicating it did not originate from our sun or its planets. Scientists have traced its path back 10 million years, attempting to identify its origin star. Previous studies of interstellar objects have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of planet formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its approach, scientists will observe it closely during its Mars flyby. The data collected may enhance understanding of icy planetesimals and the processes involved in the formation of solar systems. Future missions, such as the European Space Agency's Comet Interceptor, may target similar interstellar objects for further study.</p>
