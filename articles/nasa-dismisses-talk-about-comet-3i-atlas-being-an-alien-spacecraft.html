      <h2>NASA dismisses talk about comet 3I/ATLAS being an alien spacecraft</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, first spotted in July, and has dismissed speculation that it is an alien spacecraft. The U.S. space agency provided this update during a briefing in Greenbelt, Maryland, on November 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights ongoing public interest in extraterrestrial life and the origins of celestial objects. NASA officials have emphasized that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a typical comet, and they continue to study it using various scientific platforms.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
  <li>The comet is on its way out of the solar system after its closest approach to the sun in October 2025.</li>
  <li>NASA has studied 3I/ATLAS using over a dozen scientific platforms, including the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes.</li>
  <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth is expected to occur in about a month, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever observed, following comets 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by a telescope in Chile. In October, it made its closest approach to the sun. NASA officials have since tracked its trajectory, indicating it is now moving out of the solar system.</p>

<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA held a briefing to address speculation about the comet's nature, confirming it is a comet and not an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To start with, I’d like to address the rumors about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. This object is a comet,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“All evidence so far shows behavior by an object very similar to a solar system comet,” said Larry Denneau, co-principal investigator for ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The idea that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft is simply nonsense,” added Chris Lintott, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time celestial objects have sparked speculation about extraterrestrial life. Previous interstellar comets, such as 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also generated interest. NASA has ongoing missions to search for signs of life beyond Earth, which adds to public curiosity about such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels out of the solar system and will analyze data collected from various scientific instruments to better understand its composition and origins.</p>
