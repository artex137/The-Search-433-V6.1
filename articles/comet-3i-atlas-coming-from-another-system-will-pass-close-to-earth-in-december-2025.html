      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS, coming from another system, will pass close to Earth in December 2025</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, identified as 3I/ATLAS, will pass approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, using the ATLAS survey system, is the third of its kind recognized within our solar system. Experts have confirmed that there is no risk of collision with Earth.</p>

<p>The close approach of 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity for astronomers to study an object originating from beyond our solar system. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are currently monitoring the comet's trajectory and activity as it approaches its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, which it reached on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Close Approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at Closest Approach: Approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed Relative to the Sun: 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Perihelion Date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Diameter of Nucleus: Estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Length of Tail: Reached 56,000 kilometers in August 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS survey system in Hawaii. Subsequent observations confirmed its active status, characterized by a distinct coma and a forming tail. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun. As it approaches Earth on December 19, 2025, it will continue its trajectory out of the solar system.</p>

<p>On November 30, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured detailed images of the comet, revealing its faint coma and developing gaseous tail. Observations by the Juice mission from ESA also recorded a clear tail, contributing to the understanding of the comet's structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activity of 3I/ATLAS, including its gas and dust emissions, provides crucial data for understanding the conditions under which celestial bodies form,” said a spokesperson from ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant due to its interstellar origin, indicated by its hyperbolic orbit with an eccentricity greater than 6. This distinguishes it from comets that originate within our solar system. Observations have revealed the presence of organic compounds, such as methanol and hydrogen cyanide, which are vital for understanding the formation of planets and the potential origin of water on Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The visibility of comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to continue until January 2026. After this period, the comet will begin to decrease in luminosity, making it more challenging to observe. Ongoing studies will focus on its composition and behavior, contributing to the understanding of other planetary systems.</p>
