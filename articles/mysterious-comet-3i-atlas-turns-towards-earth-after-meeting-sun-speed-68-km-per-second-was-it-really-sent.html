      <h2>Mysterious comet 3I/ATLAS turns towards Earth after meeting Sun</h2>

<p>A mysterious object known as 3I/ATLAS is racing through space and has turned towards Earth after its recent encounter with the Sun. This interstellar comet travels at a speed of approximately <strong>68 kilometres per second</strong> and does not appear to be affected by the Sun’s gravity.</p>

<p>According to NASA, 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet that originated from beyond our solar system. Its unusual trajectory has sparked intrigue among scientists and the public. Some experts have even speculated that it could be a spaceship sent by aliens, a theory that has garnered interest from notable figures, including Elon Musk.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: 68 kilometres per second</li>
    <li>Origin: Beyond our solar system</li>
    <li>Current Trajectory: Turning towards Earth</li>
    <li>NASA Classification: Interstellar comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as it entered the solar system, exhibiting a speed and trajectory that puzzled astronomers. Following its close pass by the Sun, it has altered its course towards Earth.</p>
<p>NASA has monitored the comet's path, noting its unique characteristics that differentiate it from typical comets that orbit the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet that has come from beyond our solar system,” NASA has stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS are rare and have been the subject of scientific study since the first such object, ‘Oumuamua,’ was discovered in 2017. The study of these objects can provide insight into the formation of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth to gather more data and better understand its composition and trajectory.</p>
