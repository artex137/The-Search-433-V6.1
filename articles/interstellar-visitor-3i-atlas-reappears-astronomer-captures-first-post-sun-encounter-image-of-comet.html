      <h2>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS reappears: Astronomer captures first post-Sun encounter image of comet</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reappeared after passing behind the sun, with astronomer Qicheng Zhang capturing its first optical post-perihelion image from Lowell Observatory in Arizona on Friday, 31 October. The image shows the comet emerging after its close approach to the sun, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to be discovered. Following its perihelion on 29 October, the comet is expected to brighten further, allowing amateur astronomers across the Northern Hemisphere to observe it. Zhang confirmed the comet’s visibility through small telescopes and shared details on his Cometary blog on Sunday, 2 November.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was last observed at perihelion on 29 October, approximately 130 million miles (210 million kilometres) from the sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at speeds above 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>The first post-Sun encounter image was captured on 31 October by Qicheng Zhang at Lowell Observatory.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to become visible to amateur astronomers soon.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving northward, away from the northeastern horizon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July and briefly disappeared from view while circling the sun. It reached its closest point to the sun on 29 October. During this time, researchers continued tracking its movement using space telescopes.</p>
<p>On 31 October, Qicheng Zhang captured an optical image of the comet from Lowell Observatory. On 28 October, Zhang and a colleague published a study suggesting the comet had brightened significantly before perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All you need is a clear sky and a low eastern horizon,” said Qicheng Zhang, indicating conditions for viewing the comet. </blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet is rising quickly from the sun,” Zhang added. “In about a week, it should be 25 or 30 degrees away, allowing many large telescopes worldwide to begin tracking it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its interstellar origin but also for its potential age, with some studies suggesting it could be around three billion years older than our solar system. This raises the possibility of gaining insights into the early solar system and the formation of celestial bodies.</p>
<p>While there has been speculation regarding the comet being an alien probe, experts have largely dismissed these theories, affirming its nature as a comet from another star system within the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away from the sun, researchers expect to gather more data about its composition. Zhang anticipates that as the comet climbs higher in the morning sky, more observations and research will take place.</p>
