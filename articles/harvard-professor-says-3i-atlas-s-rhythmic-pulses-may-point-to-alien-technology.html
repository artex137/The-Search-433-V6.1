      <h2>Harvard professor says 3I/ATLAS’s rhythmic pulses may point to alien technology</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may exhibit characteristics indicative of alien technology, according to recent statements reported on December 8. Discovered on July 1, 2023, 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between 7.6 and 14 billion years old, making it potentially older than the solar system.</p>

<p>This assertion has reignited discussions about the comet's nature and origin, with Loeb proposing that its rhythmic pulses could signal artificial activity. NASA has captured images of 3I/ATLAS but maintains that it is a natural comet, not an alien craft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> 7.6 to 14 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Next Close Approach:</strong> March 2026, near Jupiter</li>
    <li><strong>Key Figure:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's Position:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is a comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2023. Since its discovery, it has captured the attention of the scientific community due to its age and unusual characteristics. Avi Loeb has consistently advocated for the possibility of alien technology, recently discussing the comet's periodic pulses in interviews and on his blog.</p>
<p>On December 8, 2023, Loeb elaborated on these pulses, suggesting they could represent thrusts from an artificial spacecraft. He highlighted that the comet appears to "blink" every 16.16 hours, an observation documented in a July issue of the Astronomy and Physics journal.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The pulses could be periodic thrusts for orbit corrections or some other internal cycle within the spacecraft.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The periodic modulation of its light must originate from its puffs of gas and dust that scatter sunlight around it.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s not a spinning rock.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions surrounding 3I/ATLAS have included speculation about its potential to be an alien artifact. While some scientists support Loeb's theories, the broader consensus remains that 3I/ATLAS is a comet. NASA continues to assert that the object is a natural phenomenon, despite ongoing debates among experts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter in March 2026, scientists will continue to study its behavior and characteristics. NASA plans to maintain its position that the comet is a natural object, while Loeb and others may pursue further investigation into its unusual features.</p>
