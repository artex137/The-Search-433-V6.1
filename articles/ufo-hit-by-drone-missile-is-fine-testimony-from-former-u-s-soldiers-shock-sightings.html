      <h2>UFO Hit by Drone Missile Is Fine</h2>

<p>A video has surfaced showing a UFO flying over the sea that remained intact after being hit by a U.S. drone missile. The incident occurred on October 30, 2024, near Yemen, according to a report from the New York Post and other U.S. media. The missile, a 100-pound (about 45 kg) Hellfire air-to-ground missile launched by an MQ-9 Reaper drone, struck the object but did not cause any damage.</p>

<p>This revelation has raised questions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and prompted discussions in the U.S. Congress. The U.S. House of Representatives' Public Trust Restoration Committee recently held a hearing where the footage was presented by Republican Representative Eric Burlison. The committee aims to address concerns about UAPs and restore public trust in government disclosures regarding these incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date of incident: October 30, 2024</li>
<li>Location: Near Yemen</li>
<li>Type of missile: 100-pound (about 45 kg) Hellfire</li>
<li>Drone type: MQ-9 Reaper</li>
<li>Notable witnesses: Former Air Force veterans Jeffrey Nuchetelli and Dylan Borland</li>
<li>UAP classification: Unidentified flight phenomenon (UAP)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone launched a Hellfire missile at a UFO over the sea near Yemen. Footage of the incident was recorded by another drone and later presented during a congressional hearing.</p>

<p>During the hearing, two former U.S. Air Force veterans testified about their personal experiences with UAPs. Jeffrey Nuchetelli recounted an incident from October 14, 2003, at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, where he witnessed a large red square hovering over missile defense facilities. Dylan Borland shared his experience of seeing a triangular-shaped UFO at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in the summer of 2012.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Hellfire missile hit UFO but bounced off. What the hell is that?”</blockquote>
<cite>— George Nap, UFO expert</cite>

<blockquote>“A rectangular-shaped aircraft larger than a football field floated silently for about 45 seconds and then disappeared at an incredible speed.”</blockquote>
<cite>— Jeffrey Nuchetelli, former Air Force military police</cite>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This latest incident adds to a growing body of evidence and testimonies regarding UAPs, rekindling public interest in the topic. Previous incidents have included military sightings and unclassified reports, but details have often been scarce or contested. The Pentagon has faced criticism for its handling of UAP information, with some veterans expressing frustration over the lack of transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident are ongoing, and the U.S. Congress is expected to continue discussions on UAPs. Further hearings may be scheduled to explore these phenomena and the implications for national security.
