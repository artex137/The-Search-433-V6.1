      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Shows Signs of Cryovolcanic Activity</h2>

<p>A series of cryovolcanoes have erupted on the surface of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, according to preliminary research from the Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC/IEEC) in Spain. The findings were reported by leading researcher Josep Trigo-Rodríguez and his team, who have conducted observations of the comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that comet 3I/ATLAS may be covered in cryovolcanoes activated by the corrosion of pristine materials locked inside its core. Such activity could provide insights into the composition and behavior of icy bodies in the outer solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently approaching the sun.</li>
    <li>Research has been led by Josep Trigo-Rodríguez at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain.</li>
    <li>Preliminary findings indicate the presence of cryovolcanoes on the comet's surface.</li>
    <li>These findings have not yet been peer-reviewed.</li>
    <li>The comet is thought to be similar to icy trans-Neptunian objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent observations of comet 3I/ATLAS have indicated unusual activity as it nears the sun. The research team, led by Trigo-Rodríguez, has been monitoring the comet's surface for signs of cryovolcanism. The initial findings were based on data collected in the last few weeks, highlighting the potential for further research as the comet continues its approach.</p>

<p>The research team aims to publish their findings in a peer-reviewed journal, which will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of cryovolcanoes on comet 3I/ATLAS suggests that it may share characteristics with icy bodies in the outer solar system,” said Josep Trigo-Rodríguez. “This could change our understanding of such comets and their formation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of cryovolcanism on comet 3I/ATLAS adds to a growing body of research on the behavior of comets as they approach the sun. Previous studies have indicated that similar icy bodies can exhibit active geological processes, which may inform scientists about the early solar system's conditions.</p>

<p>Understanding these processes is crucial for comprehending the formation and evolution of celestial bodies within our solar system and beyond.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun. Further observations and analyses are expected to clarify the nature of its cryovolcanic activity and its implications for our understanding of icy celestial bodies.</p>
