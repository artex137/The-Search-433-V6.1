      <h2>NASA will unveil extraordinary new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA is set to release detailed images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a live broadcast on Wednesday, November 19, at 20:00 UTC. The comet, first detected in July 2025, is only the third confirmed object to enter the Solar System from interstellar space.</p>

<p>This event is significant as scientists have tracked the comet for months, anticipating its peak activity after it reappeared following a period behind the Sun. Researchers expect contributions to the images from multiple instruments, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Event date: November 19, 2025</li>
<li>Broadcast time: 20:00 UTC</li>
<li>Comet's closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
<li>First detected: July 2025</li>
<li>Comet reached perihelion on: October 29, 2025</li>
<li>Instruments expected to contribute: Hubble, James Webb, Mars orbiters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. The comet gained attention due to its interstellar origin. It moved behind the Sun on October 21, 2025, and reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2025. The comet reappeared in early November 2025.</p>
<p>During its perihelion phase, Earth-based telescopes were unable to observe the comet due to its position behind the Sun. However, it passed close to Mars during this time, leading to hopes that Mars-based instruments captured data on its activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa noted, “Assets within NASA’s science missions give the United States the unique capability to observe 3I/ATLAS almost the entire time it passes through our celestial neighborhood, and study with complementary scientific instruments and from different directions how the comet behaves.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the Solar System, following previous discoveries that have intrigued scientists and space enthusiasts alike. The comet's behavior as it approaches the Sun provides valuable insights into the composition and dynamics of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth on December 19, 2025. The agency will provide updates and further observations through its various platforms, including NASA Live and YouTube.</p>
