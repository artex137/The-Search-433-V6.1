      <h2>Yorkshire resident spots saucer-shaped 'UFO' flying through the hills near Skipton</h2>

<p>A Yorkshire resident has captured a photograph of a saucer-shaped object flying in the hills near Skipton on September 13, 2025. The object was spotted by photographer John Tunnah while he was travelling home and does not appear to have caused any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>The sighting has drawn interest from UFO experts and the public alike. Authorities have not disclosed any plans for investigation, but the incident has sparked discussions about unidentified flying objects, particularly in the context of recent reports of similar sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Photographer: John Tunnah</li>
    <li>Date of sighting: September 13, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Near Skipton, Yorkshire</li>
    <li>Camera used: Pentax Optio SVi</li>
    <li>Number of photographs taken: 10-12</li>
    <li>Object description: Saucer-shaped, round and elongated</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 13, 2025, John Tunnah took multiple photographs while driving near Skipton. He noticed a 'perfectly formed arch of cloud' and pulled over to take photos. After reviewing the images later that evening, he discovered the saucer-shaped object in one photo, which did not appear in the others.</p>

<p>Tunnah shared the photo with friends, who agreed that it looked like a solid object moving at speed. He described the phenomenon as a probable UFO, although he noted he is not typically interested in UFOs or alien visitations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Why it was manoeuvring at low level over West Yorkshire was a mystery," said John Tunnah.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "When photos show an anomaly that wasn't seen at the time, I suspect either a glitch with the camera, or a fast-moving object like a bird or an insect, close to the lens," stated Nick Pope, a UFO expert formerly with the UK's Ministry of Defence.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting adds to a growing number of UFO reports in recent years. A Pentagon document published in 2023 revealed that most UFOs are described as round or spherical, with various shapes reported over the years. The US Department of Defense has faced scrutiny over its handling of UFO sightings, and a recent report highlighted over 8,000 sightings in the US from December 2022 to June 2025.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for further investigation into Tunnah's sighting. The public continues to show interest in UFO phenomena, potentially leading to more discussions and analyses of similar images and reports.</p>
