      <h2>Scientist Claims 100,000 UFOs Linked to Earth's Nuclear Tests in Chilling Report</h2>

<p>A study by Swedish astrophysicist Dr. Beatriz Villarroel has sparked claims online that aliens monitored Cold War nuclear tests. The report, released in October 2025, focuses on Villarroel's research at Stockholm University and the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics, which examines historical images of the sky. It has led to widespread misinterpretation of her findings, suggesting a link between her work and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).</p>

<p>This situation has raised concerns among experts about the potential for misinformation to distort rigorous scientific research. Authorities and educators are now urging the public to distinguish between legitimate scientific findings and speculative claims regarding UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dr. Beatriz Villarroel leads the VASCO Project, which studies historical astronomical data.</li>
    <li>Over 100,000 archival sky plates have been scanned for analysis.</li>
    <li>The claim of '100,000 UFOs' refers to images reviewed, not detected objects.</li>
    <li>Dr. Villarroel reported nine transient light sources that vanished over time.</li>
    <li>The causes of these disappearances are likely instrument artefacts or brief astrophysical flares.</li>
    <li>No peer-reviewed evidence links her findings to nuclear tests or extraterrestrial activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2021, Dr. Villarroel and her colleagues published a preprint paper reporting nine transient light sources observed in 1952 Palomar plates that later vanished. This research focused on understanding natural or technical causes behind these phenomena.</p>
<p>In October 2025, social media misrepresented her work, claiming she had documented '100,000 UFOs.' This narrative gained traction online, despite the fact that the number pertains to the total images reviewed, not actual unidentified craft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We must study each case carefully before any extraordinary interpretation,” Villarroel stated in her 2021 paper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Curiosity should drive research, not distortion,” she added in a recent interview.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The VASCO Project is part of a broader effort to analyze historical astronomical data for unexplained transient events. Villarroel's team employs artificial intelligence to improve accuracy and invites amateur astronomers to assist in confirming genuine occurrences.</p>
<p>While her work has been misrepresented in relation to UAP and nuclear testing, experts emphasize that no evidence connects her findings to such events. They warn that blending astrophysics with conspiracy theories undermines public trust in scientific research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Dr. Villarroel's ongoing research aims to identify rare cosmic phenomena and improve machine-learning filters for modern astronomical surveys. The scientific community continues to encourage caution in interpreting her findings to prevent further misinformation.</p>
