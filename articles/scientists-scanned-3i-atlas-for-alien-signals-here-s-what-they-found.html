      <h2>Scientists Scanned 3I/ATLAS for Alien Signals. Here’s What They Found</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has conducted a technosignature search of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which passed near Earth on December 18, 2022. The study found no credible evidence of artificial radio signals, indicating that 3I/ATLAS is likely a natural comet from beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it addresses ongoing speculation about the object's origin, particularly claims made by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft. The findings reinforce the scientific consensus that interstellar objects are natural astrophysical phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 18, 2022</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during observations: approximately 167 million miles (269 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Telescope used: Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT)</li>
    <li>Potential signals detected: 470,000</li>
    <li>Credible signals remaining after filtering: 0</li>
    <li>Research program: Breakthrough Listen</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered months before December 2022, sparking interest among astronomers regarding its composition and origin. In July 2022, Avi Loeb and colleagues suggested it could be an alien spacecraft. Following this, the Breakthrough Listen program initiated a technosignature search as the comet approached Earth.</p>

<p>The GBT conducted scans that initially detected 470,000 potential signals, but after eliminating those that were identified as human-made interference, no credible signals remained. Other research groups also conducted searches around the same time, yielding similar results.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is currently no evidence to suggest that [interstellar objects] are anything other than natural astrophysical objects,” the study authors wrote.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“However, given the small number of such objects known (only three to date), and the plausibility of interstellar probes as a technosignature, thorough study is warranted.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study is part of a broader scientific effort to understand interstellar objects. 3I/ATLAS is only the third such object identified, following two others that exhibited different characteristics. The ongoing analysis of 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the nature of other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers plan to continue analyzing the data collected from 3I/ATLAS for years to enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their properties. Further studies may not yield evidence of extraterrestrial life but will contribute to the knowledge of cosmic phenomena.</p>
