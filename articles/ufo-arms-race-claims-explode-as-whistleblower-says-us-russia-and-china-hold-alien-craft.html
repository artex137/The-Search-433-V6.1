      <h2>UFO Arms Race Claims Explode as Whistleblower Says US, Russia and China Hold Alien Craft</h2>

<p>Claims that the United States, Russia, and China possess alien technology have resurfaced following testimony in Washington by former US intelligence officer David Grusch. Speaking under oath, Grusch alleged that these countries hold exotic non-human craft, raising concerns about a covert arms race beyond conventional weapons.</p>

<p>This testimony has prompted renewed attention from authorities and the public alike. Lawmakers are investigating the implications of these claims, particularly regarding national security and technological advancements that could arise from such alleged discoveries.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Whistleblower David Grusch testified before Congress in 2023.</li>
    <li>Grusch claimed multiple crashed UFOs have been recovered by US agencies.</li>
    <li>He alleged that secret programs have existed for decades, outside normal oversight.</li>
    <li>Rival powers, including Russia and China, are reportedly engaged in similar operations.</li>
    <li>Allegations include a Soviet operation in August 1989 near Prokhladny involving a crashed UFO.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, David Grusch provided testimony to Congress regarding the recovery of non-human craft by US intelligence agencies. He claimed that these operations have been ongoing for decades and that similar efforts exist in Russia and China.</p>

<p>Grusch's assertions have led to a renewed public interest in the topic, with additional whistleblowers emerging to support his claims. The testimony has ignited discussions about the implications of an alleged global technology race.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The lack of visible evidence does not weaken the claims,” said supporters of the whistleblower’s assertions. “Such material would be guarded more tightly than even the Manhattan Project during the Second World War.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historic incidents, such as the alleged Soviet recovery of a UFO in 1989, have fueled speculation about long-term recovery efforts. Additionally, claims of a disc-shaped craft recovered in Italy in the 1930s have been linked to government secrecy and military interest in alien technology.</p>

<p>Sceptics dismiss these claims as fantasy, pointing out the absence of verified images or materials. However, supporters argue that the secrecy surrounding these operations serves as compelling evidence of their existence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into these claims are ongoing, with a focus on national security implications and the potential for technological advancements. As pressure mounts for transparency, further disclosures may be forthcoming from whistleblowers and government agencies.</p>
