      <h2>Baba Vanga’s 2026 alien prediction back in spotlight after Trump’s UFO files order</h2>

<p>The predictions of Baba Vanga have resurfaced following U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to release government documentation related to UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian clairvoyant who died in 1996, forecasted that a massive spaceship would enter Earth’s atmosphere in 2026, providing evidence that humanity is not alone in the universe.</p>

<p>This renewed interest in Vanga’s predictions comes as the U.S. government reopens discussions about extraterrestrial life. Speculation is growing on social media platforms as people share and debate her forecasts. Trump’s directive has led to calls for transparency regarding government knowledge of UFOs and alien life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Donald Trump ordered the release of UFO-related documents on February 14, 2023.</li>
    <li>Baba Vanga predicted first alien contact will occur in November 2026.</li>
    <li>Vanga lost her vision at age 12 due to an accident but gained abilities to predict events.</li>
    <li>She is known for accurately predicting significant events, including the downfall of the Soviet Union and the 9/11 attacks.</li>
    <li>Her predictions are primarily recorded through accounts from her niece, Krasimira Stoyanova, and her followers.</li>
    <li>Critics argue that Vanga’s predictions have been misinterpreted over the years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1996, Baba Vanga passed away, leaving behind a legacy of predictions shared through her followers. Over the years, her foresight has gained a following, and many have looked to her words for guidance on future events.</p>

<p>On February 14, 2023, President Trump made headlines by ordering the release of documents related to UFOs and UAPs. This followed former President Barack Obama’s remarks suggesting the existence of extraterrestrial life, which Trump criticized for revealing classified information.</p>

<p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump emphasized the importance of transparency regarding government knowledge of alien life and UAPs, declaring, “I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files.”</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”</blockquote>
<p>- Donald Trump, in a post on Truth Social</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Baba Vanga, often referred to as the Nostradamus of the Balkans, has been known for her predictions on world events. Despite her passing, her followers continue to interpret her prophecies, with many believing that her foresight about alien contact will come to fruition in 2026.</p>

<p>Government officials, including those from the Pentagon, have previously stated that there is no concrete evidence supporting the existence of UFOs or extraterrestrials. However, the recent actions of Trump have reignited public interest and debate.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
