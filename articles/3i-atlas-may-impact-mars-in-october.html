      <h2>3I/ATLAS may impact Mars in October</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed an interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, that may collide with Mars in October 2025, according to findings from the James Webb Space Telescope. The comet is currently approaching the Solar System and is expected to come within 2 million kilometers of Mars.</p>

<p>This potential impact has raised interest among scientists, particularly due to the comet's unusual characteristics. The high ratio of carbon dioxide to water and its heavily irradiated icy core suggest it may not be an ordinary comet. Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University has proposed that 3I/ATLAS could be a technological artifact from extraterrestrial sources, based on its precise trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Expected closest approach:</strong> October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> 2 million km</li>
    <li><strong>Momentum needed for collision:</strong> 10 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Observation tool:</strong> NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early 2025, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS as it entered the Solar System. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, they identified anomalies in its composition, including a high carbon dioxide ratio. Professor Loeb has theorized about its potential origins, suggesting it may be a technological artifact.</p>

<p>Calculations indicate that a minor course correction could result in a collision with Mars. Adam Hibberd, a student of Loeb, stated that a momentum increase in September 2025 could lead to a collision as early as October.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If a collision occurs, it may not be a coincidence, but a potential sign of technology,” said Professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has generated significant debate within the scientific community regarding the nature of interstellar objects. Previous incidents involving unidentified celestial bodies have led to discussions about their potential origins, including the possibility of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to analyze data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for any signs of tiny objects that may have already impacted Mars, which could provide further insight into the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its origins.</p>
