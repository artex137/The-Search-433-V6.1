      <h2>Activity Detected from NASA Interstellar Comet 3I ATLAS in New JUICE NavCam Preview</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that interstellar comet 3I ATLAS is exhibiting clear signs of activity, as shown in recent images from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) JUICE spacecraft Navigation Camera (NavCam). The images reveal the comet, which is currently traveling through our solar system, is surrounded by a glowing cloud of gas and dust.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever identified. Scientists are closely monitoring its activity to gather insights about its composition and to compare it with comets from our solar system. The findings may provide valuable information on the formation of planets and the evolution of star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is traveling on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>Observations show the comet is surrounded by a coma and exhibiting two tail features: a plasma tail and a dust tail.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach its closest approach to Earth at approximately 170 million miles (270 million km) on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Detailed scientific data from JUICE is expected in February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA's ATLAS survey telescope in Chile first identified the comet 3I ATLAS. Since then, it has been observed closely by a network of space telescopes and instruments. The most recent images from the JUICE NavCam have shown signs of activity, including a bright coma and hints of tail features.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches the Sun, its ices are sublimating, creating observable gas and dust. This activity is anticipated to increase as it gets closer to its closest approach in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The early NavCam preview image shows 3I ATLAS surrounded by a bright halo of gas known as a coma,” said ESA scientists. “These findings have built excitement for deeper analysis once the full data arrives.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS is a unique interstellar visitor, providing scientists with an opportunity to study materials that have formed around other stars. Previous interstellar objects have offered limited data, making this comet's observations particularly valuable.</p>
<p>The activity detected in 3I ATLAS is significant as it allows researchers to compare its composition with that of comets formed in our solar system, potentially revealing differences or similarities in chemical makeup and ice content.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. They anticipate receiving more detailed data from the JUICE spacecraft’s scientific instruments in early 2026, which will enhance understanding of the comet’s structure and composition.</p>
