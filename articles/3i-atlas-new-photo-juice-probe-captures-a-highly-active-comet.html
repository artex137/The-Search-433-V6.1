      <h2>3I/ATLAS new photo: Juice probe captures a highly active comet</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has released a new photo of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, taken by its Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) probe on November 4. The image shows the comet in a highly active state, shortly after it reached perihelion on October 29. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This observation matters as it provides valuable insights into the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS, which is travelling through our solar system at high speed. ESA has stated that the Juice probe captured crucial details about the comet's gas and dust plume, although a full image will not be available until February.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: November 4, 2023</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached: October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Juice to 3I/ATLAS: approximately 66 million km</li>
    <li>Juice probe arrival at Jupiter: scheduled for 2031</li>
    <li>Instruments used: five onboard instruments, including the Navigation Camera (NavCam)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29, 2023. The Juice probe captured an image of the comet on November 4, 2023, when it was approximately 66 million km away. This observation occurred shortly after the comet's perihelion and shows it in a more active state than previous observations.</p>

<p>Prior to the Juice probe's observation, NASA's TESS noted the comet but did not detect any coma. The Mars orbiter had a closer encounter with 3I/ATLAS on October 2, 2023, but ESA reported that the Juice probe's observations provide a better view due to its timing and distance.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Not only do we clearly see the glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet known as its coma, we also see a hint of two tails,” ESA reported.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Juice is using its main high-gain antenna to protect itself from the Sun's heat and radiation, while employing its smaller medium-gain antenna to send the picture at a lower rate,” ESA noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has been the subject of interest since its discovery. Observations from different space missions, including NASA's TESS and the Mars orbiter, have provided varying insights into its characteristics. The timing of these observations significantly affects the data collected, with the Juice probe capturing images shortly after the comet's perihelion, revealing its heightened activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA plans to release the full image of 3I/ATLAS in February 2024. The Juice probe will continue its mission as it travels to Jupiter, scheduled to arrive in 2031, gathering data on Jupiter's icy moons along the way.</p>
