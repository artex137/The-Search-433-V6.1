      <h2>3I/ATLAS turns striking blue near the Sun on October 29</h2>

<p>Astronomers have reported that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has become significantly brighter and bluer than the Sun as it approached perihelion on October 29, 2025. The transformation was observed using instruments aboard NASA’s STEREO-A, ESA’s SOHO, and NOAA’s GOES-19 satellites, which provided crucial data despite the object being obscured from Earth-based telescopes.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it could reshape current models of cometary evolution and solar-interstellar interactions. Researchers are currently analyzing the data to understand the causes behind the unexpected brightening and color change of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments used:</strong> NASA’s STEREO-A, ESA’s SOHO, NOAA’s GOES-19</li>
    <li><strong>Distance of glow:</strong> Up to 300,000 kilometers around the object</li>
    <li><strong>Expected closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Initial detection year:</strong> 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2025. Its perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, when astronomers noted a sudden increase in brightness and a shift to a blue hue. The observations took place through various space-based observatories between September and October 2025.</p>

<p>As the object neared the Sun, it exhibited unusual characteristics, including rapid brightening and a color shift that defies typical comet behavior. The data collected will be crucial for upcoming observations as the object makes its closest approach to Earth in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reason for 3I/ATLAS’s rapid brightening, which far exceeds the rate of most Oort Cloud comets, remains unclear,” said Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project. “The blue emission is very surprising, as dust is expected to redden scattered sunlight.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike previous interstellar visitors, 3I/ATLAS has shown a unique combination of brightness, coloration, and response to solar radiation, raising questions about its composition and behavior.</p>

<p>This event highlights the importance of solar observatories in studying non-solar phenomena, especially when traditional Earth-based telescopes cannot observe due to solar glare or geometric obstructions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its perihelion, astronomers expect 3I/ATLAS to become visible again from Earth-based telescopes by late November 2025. The object is slated to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, providing an opportunity for detailed observations using the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>
