      <h2>Close encounter with aliens and 'jellyfish' UFO turned soldiers into stone</h2>

<p>Reports have emerged from the 1980s detailing a close encounter with a jellyfish-shaped UFO over Nalchik, southern Russia, on February 13, 1989. The incident involved a formation that allegedly hovered for over an hour before disappearing, according to recently released Soviet-era documents. No injuries or fatalities have been reported from this specific event.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it sheds light on the Soviet government's secretive monitoring of UFO sightings, which it had previously mocked. George Knapp, a journalist who translated the documents, has released 70 pages of information related to various sightings from the 1970s and 1980s, offering insights into the Soviet response to unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: February 13, 1989</li>
    <li>Location: Nalchik, southern Russia</li>
    <li>Formation type: Jellyfish-shaped UFO</li>
    <li>Duration: Over one hour</li>
    <li>Number of witnesses: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Archive release: Early 1990s, made broadly available recently</li>
    <li>Other notable incident: 1993 military encounter in Siberia</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the late 1970s and 1980s, multiple UFO sightings were reported across the Soviet Union, including the notable event in Nalchik on February 13, 1989. During this incident, witnesses claimed to see a jellyfish-like UFO for over an hour before it vanished. Another encounter occurred in 1979 in Kazakhstan, where a camper observed tall, dark figures near a forest.</p>

<p>In 1993, state media reported that the Russian military had shot down an extraterrestrial vessel in Siberia. This led to an encounter with five humanoid entities that allegedly transformed into a luminous sphere, resulting in the transformation of 23 nearby soldiers into stone pillars. Only two witnesses reportedly survived this incident.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The archive was smuggled out of Russia in the early 1990s and has only recently been made broadly available,” said George Knapp, the journalist who translated the documents.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>These incidents form part of a broader pattern of UFO sightings documented by military personnel, technical experts, and civilians during the Soviet era. Critics have speculated that many of these events can be attributed to atmospheric phenomena, equipment malfunctions, or experimental military aircraft. Some files even considered the possibility of foreign technology being involved, reflecting the Cold War anxieties of the time.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into these historical sightings may continue as interest in UFO phenomena grows. Authorities have not disclosed any plans for further examination of the incidents documented in the recently released files.</p>
