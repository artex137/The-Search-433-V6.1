      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Displays Unusual Behavior as Hubble Observes Persistent Jet</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured an image of comet 3I/ATLAS on January 7, 2026, revealing a persistent sunward jet that defies typical cometary behavior. The image shows a distinct triple-jet structure, with the primary jet extending toward the Sun, raising questions about the object's dynamics as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it challenges existing models of comet behavior. Scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to understand the mechanisms behind its unusual trajectory and jet alignment. With a close encounter with Jupiter approaching, researchers are concerned about the potential implications for the comet's stability and behavior in a strong gravitational field.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of observation:</strong> January 7, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Next close approach:</strong> March 26, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Distance of sunward jet:</strong> Approximately the Earth-Moon distance</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> NASA, ESA, Space Telescope Science Institute</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed as it entered the Solar System. Since then, its behavior has been monitored through various observation windows. The most recent image from Hubble has provided the clearest view yet of its anomalous jet structure.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, scientists will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, assessing how the gas giant's gravitational influence might affect the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The repeated alignment sharply narrows the range of plausible explanations for 3I/ATLAS’s behavior,” said a representative from NASA. “We are observing something that does not align with typical cometary models.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous observations of comets have shown that jets typically trail away from the Sun and reorient as the object moves away. However, 3I/ATLAS has maintained a sunward jet, which is unprecedented. This behavior could indicate a unique interaction with solar forces, setting it apart from other known comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will conduct additional imaging, spectral analysis, and positional tracking of 3I/ATLAS as it nears Jupiter. The results will help determine if the sunward jet persists and what implications that may have for understanding interstellar objects in the Solar System.</p>
