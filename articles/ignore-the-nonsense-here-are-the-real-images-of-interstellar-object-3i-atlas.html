      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: An Interstellar Visitor Observed</h2>

<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, moving through the Solar System at escape velocity. The comet is currently approaching the Sun and has been observed by various telescopes as it travels toward interstellar space. There have been numerous conspiracy theories surrounding the object, including claims of alien encounters. However, astronomers continue to provide verified images of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it adds to our understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics. NASA and other space agencies are actively observing 3I/ATLAS to gather data before it leaves the Solar System, which could provide insights into future interstellar explorations and the nature of such objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth during Hubble observation:</strong> 445,788,000 km (277 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> 30 million km (18.6 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Telescopes used:</strong> ATLAS, Hubble, JWST, SPHEREx, ExoMars TGO</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Currently behind the Sun from Earth's perspective</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the ATLAS telescope in Chile made the initial observation of 3I/ATLAS. On July 21, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet as it moved through the Solar System. NASA’s SPHEREx observed the comet from August 7 to August 15, providing dramatic views of its brightness and movement. On October 3, the European Space Agency’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter observed the comet during its closest approach to Mars.</p>

<p>Throughout this period, various claims about images of 3I/ATLAS have emerged, including unverified assertions that the Perseverance rover captured the comet. These claims remain unconfirmed, with some images likely depicting Mars's moon, Phobos.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Together with Mars Express, ExoMars TGO had the closest view of the comet of all ESA spacecraft. It looked towards the interstellar interloper from 30 million km away during its closest approach to the Red Planet,” said the European Space Agency regarding its observations of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed by astronomers, following the previous discoveries of 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of such objects is crucial for understanding the composition and dynamics of materials from other star systems. Observations of 3I/ATLAS may contribute to future research on interstellar exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will maintain observations and collect data until the comet reemerges from behind the Sun. This could allow for additional imaging opportunities, potentially including amateur telescope observations.</p>
