      <h2>Mysterious interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS appears to change colour for third time with sudden brightening</h2>

<p>A mysterious glow has returned to the skies as interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has developed a faint blue hue after an unexpected brightening behind the Sun. This phenomenon, observed by spacecraft data, has puzzled astronomers once again. The comet was first discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile and has been travelling through our solar system at over 210,000 kilometres per hour.</p>

<p>This recent change in colour is significant because it may provide insights into the comet's composition and behaviour. According to a recent unpublished study, researchers noted a striking blue tint in 3I/ATLAS’s coma after it re-emerged from behind the Sun in late October. The study suggests that gases like carbon monoxide or ammonia could be leaking from the comet’s icy surface, giving it a cooler tone.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> 29 October 2025, at approximately 210 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Next closest distance to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025, within 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 210,000 kilometres per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Previous colour changes:</strong> Red in July, green in September</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. It first appeared to glow red in July, likely due to dust reflecting sunlight. In September, it shifted to a green hue, possibly caused by molecules such as dicarbon or cyanide. After a period of invisibility while behind the Sun, the comet re-emerged in late October with a blue tint.</p>
<p>The comet made a close approach to Mars in early October before reaching its nearest point to the Sun on 29 October. It has remained invisible to Earth-based telescopes for several weeks, although some orbiting spacecraft continued to track its movements.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The colour changes in 3I/ATLAS are intriguing and have left experts uncertain about what drives these transformations,” said a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third-known interstellar object to enter our solar system. It is unique among such visitors due to its high speed and the complexity of its materials, shaped by billions of years of cosmic radiation. Some scientists have speculated that it may be an artificial object or of alien technology, based on its features, but there has been no verification for this suggestion. Most experts agree that it behaves like a typical comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Stargazers in the Northern Hemisphere may soon catch a glimpse of 3I/ATLAS using telescopes or powerful binoculars. Two European Space Agency spacecraft are expected to cross the comet’s tail later this year, which may provide new insights into its structure and composition. Astronomers hope the returning visibility of 3I/ATLAS will help solve the mystery of its shifting colours and reveal more about its interstellar origins.</p>
