      <h2>Mystery interstellar object defies NASA's expectations as more details emerge</h2>

<p>A peculiar object, identified as comet 3I/ATLAS, has defied NASA's expectations after being observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in early September 2023. The comet was first discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey telescope and is noted as the third object entering our solar system from another star.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the conditions of the early solar system. Astronomers aim to understand the comet's size, physical properties, and chemical makeup, which may reveal information about the formation of planets, asteroids, and comets approximately 4.6 billion years ago.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Observed by JWST using its Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec).</li>
    <li>Comet is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Outgassing emissions include carbon dioxide, water, and carbonyl sulfide.</li>
    <li>Highest ratio of carbon dioxide to water ever observed in a comet.</li>
    <li>Comet may be approximately three billion years older than our solar system.</li>
    <li>Current trajectory suggests origin from the Milky Way's 'thick disk' of stars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS survey telescope. In early September 2023, the JWST utilized its NIRSpec to observe the comet, revealing key details about its composition and behavior as it approaches the sun.</p>

<p>A preprint paper has outlined the importance of studying this comet, emphasizing its potential to enhance understanding of the early solar system and the conditions that formed it. The comet's outgassing activity has been closely monitored as it nears the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations of 3I/ATLAS provide a unique opportunity to study the chemical composition of an object from another star,” said an astronomer involved in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects include 1I/'Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, found in 2019. These objects have sparked interest in the scientific community regarding their origins and the implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<p>The study of comets like 3I/ATLAS is crucial as they may hold clues about the early solar system's formation and the building blocks of planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, gathering more data on its outgassing and chemical makeup. Further observations are expected to provide additional insights into the comet's origins and its implications for the study of interstellar objects.</p>
