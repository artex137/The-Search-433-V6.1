      <h2>V-Shaped UFO Sighting Reported Over Los Angeles</h2>
<p>A black, V-shaped craft covered in lights has been observed hovering over Los Angeles on August 28, 2025, according to reports from local residents. The sighting lasted approximately 25 minutes, but there have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to the incident.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it marks the 34th report of a similar V-shaped craft, or chevron, across the United States in 2025. UFO researcher and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee has suggested that the craft may not be of extraterrestrial origin, but rather an unmanned drone testing new technology for the U.S. government or another world power.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: August 28, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Los Angeles, California</li>
    <li>Duration of sighting: Approximately 25 minutes</li>
    <li>Total V-shaped craft sightings in 2025: 34</li>
    <li>Reported by: Los Angeles residents</li>
    <li>Expert analysis by: Mark Christopher Lee</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 28, 2025, a pair of residents in Los Angeles spotted a V-shaped craft moving slowly above the city. The sighting lasted for about 25 minutes, during which the craft was described as being covered in lights.</p>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee, a UFO researcher, later analyzed the footage and suggested that the craft is likely an advanced terrestrial drone rather than an alien spacecraft. He claims that many UFO sightings may involve technology decades ahead of what is currently understood.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I’m convinced that a lot of famous UFO incidents are basically highly advanced terrestrial technology that is 30 to 40 years ahead of what we think they have,” said Mark Christopher Lee.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting is part of a growing trend of reports involving V-shaped crafts across the United States. In less than nine months of 2025, 34 sightings have been documented. Similar incidents have occurred in the past, where military explanations for unusual lights in the sky were met with skepticism from witnesses.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As authorities continue to investigate reports of these sightings, further analysis of the footage may provide more clarity on the nature of the craft seen over Los Angeles. There are no announced timelines for these investigations at this time.</p>
