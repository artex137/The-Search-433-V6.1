      <h2>'Neither deny or confirm...': Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS mystery deepens as CIA makes stunning revelation</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025, continues to intrigue scientists as new developments arise regarding its origins. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has made a statement that has reignited speculation about the comet, revealing that it can “neither deny nor confirm” the existence of records related to the object. NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as an ordinary comet, contradicting claims from some scientists about its potential extraterrestrial nature.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about what information the CIA may possess regarding 3I/ATLAS. The agency's refusal to clarify its position has prompted further inquiries from researchers, including a recent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by John Greenewald Jr., a prominent ufologist, who is seeking more transparency from the CIA and NASA.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The CIA stated it could not confirm or deny records related to 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>NASA has classified the comet as an ordinary celestial object.</li>
    <li>John Greenewald Jr. has filed FOIA requests with the CIA and NASA.</li>
    <li>The CIA’s response to the FOIA request is classified.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered, prompting interest in its unusual trajectory and properties. In November 2025, John Greenewald Jr. files a FOIA request seeking information about the comet. The CIA responds, stating it can neither confirm nor deny the existence of relevant records. Concurrently, NASA dismisses the notion that 3I/ATLAS is of extraterrestrial origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Very interesting, apparently CIA director John Ratcliffe knows something,” John Greenewald Jr. noted on social media.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb stated, “This information is treated as sensitive enough to be classified by the CIA, which is surprising.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This situation is not unprecedented. In the past, intelligence agencies have released information regarding celestial phenomena. For example, in 1996, the Defense Intelligence Agency released a report about Comet Hale-Bopp after a FOIA request. The current classification of 3I/ATLAS records raises questions about the nature of the information held by the CIA.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>John Greenewald Jr. plans to appeal the CIA’s response to his FOIA request. He continues to pursue information from NASA and other agencies regarding the comet. The situation remains fluid as researchers seek clarity on the implications of the CIA's classified response.</p>
