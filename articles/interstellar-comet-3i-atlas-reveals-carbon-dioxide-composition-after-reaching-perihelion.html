      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals carbon dioxide composition after reaching perihelion</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, after being detected by the ATLAS telescope in July 2025. The comet, traveling at a speed of 209,000 kilometers per hour, is the third confirmed extrasolar object to enter our Solar System. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about comet formation. The comet's composition, rich in carbon dioxide and with minimal water presence, has intrigued scientists. Astronomers from NASA have activated coordinated observation protocols to study this unique cosmic visitor, which is estimated to be over seven billion years old.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 209,000 km/h</li>
<li><strong>Estimated core diameter:</strong> Between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
<li><strong>Distance from the Sun at entry:</strong> 6.4 astronomical units</li>
<li><strong>Close approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025</li>
<li><strong>Minimum approach distance to Earth:</strong> 270 million kilometers</li>
<li><strong>Expected unobservable date:</strong> December 2025</li>
<li><strong>Next close encounter:</strong> March 2026, near Jupiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. NASA’s TESS satellite recorded early comet activity shortly after detection. The comet entered the Solar System in May 2025, marking the beginning of its observation period. It passed close to Mars on October 3, 2025, before reaching perihelion on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>Following perihelion, the comet will begin its separation phase, crossing the orbit of Jupiter. Due to its hyperbolic speed, it will become unobservable by ground-based telescopes from December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The high concentration of carbon dioxide suggests an origin in an exceptionally cold star-forming region,” said a NASA astronomer. “This finding challenges our understanding of comet formation.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Our coordinated observation campaign will refine planetary defense protocols and improve our detection models for future interstellar visitors,” stated a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the previous interstellar comets 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, recorded in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The rarity of interstellar comets provides unique opportunities for scientific research, particularly in understanding the chemical conditions around other stars and the evolution of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its passage through the Solar System, comet 3I/ATLAS will be the focus of space missions beginning in March 2026 as it approaches Jupiter. Scientists aim to map complex organic materials and enhance understanding of prebiotic chemistry in cosmic environments.</p>
