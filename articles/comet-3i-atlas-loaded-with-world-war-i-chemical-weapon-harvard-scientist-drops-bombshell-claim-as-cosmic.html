      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Loaded with World War I Chemical Weapon?</h2>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has claimed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first spotted in July, contains significant amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide. This announcement comes as the comet approaches Earth, with its closest approach expected on December 19, 2023. The comet's unusual behaviour and chemical composition have raised concerns and interest among scientists worldwide.</p>

<p>The significance of Loeb's findings lies in the implications for the origins of life on Earth. Authorities, including NASA, are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and chemical makeup. NASA astrochemist Dr. Martin Cordiner and his team at the Goddard Space Flight Center have confirmed the presence of these chemicals in substantial quantities, sparking further investigation into the comet's nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Significant amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide have been detected.</li>
    <li>Observations were made using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is the third interstellar object found in our Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed passing through the Solar System. Over the following months, scientists have studied its chemical composition and behaviour, noting unusual shifts in speed and colour. As the comet approaches Earth, new findings regarding its potential to contain harmful substances have emerged.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2023, the comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth, prompting increased scrutiny from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The anomalously large ratio of methanol to hydrogen cyanide production by 3I/ATLAS suggests a friendly nature for this interstellar visitor.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further explained, “In principle, methanol is an important agent for the origins of life. And on the other hand, the hydrogen cyanide at large concentrations is a poison.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in our Solar System, following previous discoveries that have sparked discussion about the potential for interstellar life. The presence of chemicals associated with both life and toxicity in 3I/ATLAS raises questions about the comet's role in the history of life on Earth and elsewhere in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and chemical composition. Upcoming observations from the James Webb Space Telescope are expected around its close approach on December 19, 2023, providing further insights into the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
