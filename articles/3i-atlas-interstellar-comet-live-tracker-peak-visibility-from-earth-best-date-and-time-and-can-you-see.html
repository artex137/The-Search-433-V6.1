      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-30 10:48 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet Approaches Sun</h2>
<p>Astronomy enthusiasts are preparing for the close approach of 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, which will reach its nearest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at 11:47 Universal Time (UT). This event marks a significant moment in celestial observation, as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar visitor to our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS offers a unique opportunity for scientists to study material from beyond our solar system. NASA has confirmed that the comet will pass approximately 1.4 astronomical units (210 million kilometers) from the Sun, just inside Mars' orbit. The comet will not be visible from Earth until November, as it is currently positioned behind the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion on October 29, 2025, at 11:47 UT.</li>
    <li>It will approach within 1.4 astronomical units (210 million kilometers) of the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet's diameter is estimated at 14 to 20 kilometers.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of nearly 221,000 kilometers per hour (60 km/s).</li>
    <li>It poses no threat to Earth, with a closest approach of approximately 273 million kilometers in December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey. It is moving along a hyperbolic orbit, meaning it will not return to the Sun after this visit. The comet's perihelion will occur on October 29, 2025, marking its closest approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>Visibility from Earth is expected to improve in November 2025, as the comet will re-emerge from behind the Sun's glare. Astronomers anticipate that the best viewing opportunity will be in early December 2025, shortly after sunset.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The material being ejected by 3I/ATLAS provides a snapshot of chemistry from beyond our stellar neighborhood,” noted ESA researchers. “It offers a rare glimpse into the origins of other planetary systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS is rare, with only two previous visitors noted in recent history. These comets are believed to provide insights into the formation of planetary systems outside our own. The unique chemical composition of such comets can reshape our understanding of cosmic evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope will contribute to ongoing research into the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>
