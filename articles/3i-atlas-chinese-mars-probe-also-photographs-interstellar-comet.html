      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Chinese Mars probe also photographs interstellar comet</h2>

<p>China's Mars orbiter Tianwen-1 has captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from a distance of 30 million kilometers, according to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua. The photos were taken during the comet's closest approach to the sun, providing valuable observational data.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third time an interstellar object has been identified in our solar system. The images and accompanying animation created by mission controllers illustrate the comet's movement, highlighting the importance of such observations during critical phases of its journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the sun occurred recently, allowing for enhanced observations.</li>
    <li>Tianwen-1 is part of China's extended mission to Mars.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's Trace Gas Orbiter has also photographed 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The Mars rover Perseverance may have photographed the comet, but NASA has not confirmed this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. After its discovery, it passed behind the sun from Earth's perspective, limiting visibility. In the following weeks, the comet became visible again, allowing for observations by various space probes.</p>
<p>Tianwen-1 captured images of the comet during its closest approach to the sun, which occurred just days before the images were reported.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The photos from Tianwen-1 are an important part of the orbiter's extended mission,” a spokesperson from the China National Space Administration (CNSA) stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The detection of such a faint object is a valuable test for the Tianwen-2 mission,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar visitor identified in our solar system, following previous discoveries. The ability of various space probes to photograph such objects demonstrates advancements in observational technology and international cooperation in space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>China plans to continue its observations of 3I/ATLAS as part of the extended mission of Tianwen-1, while the Tianwen-2 mission is set to explore an asteroid and a comet in the near future.</p>
