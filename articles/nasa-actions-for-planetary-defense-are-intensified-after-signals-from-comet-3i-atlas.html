      <h2>NASA Actions for Planetary Defense Are Intensified After Signals from Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The American Space Agency (NASA) has intensified its planetary defense operations in 2025 after detecting unusual radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet, identified by the ATLAS system on July 1, 2025, is the third known interstellar object and has prompted a global mobilization of scientists to analyze its composition and trajectory.</p>

<p>This development is significant because the unusual nature of the comet and the origin of the signals are central to ongoing investigations aimed at ensuring terrestrial safety in the face of celestial objects of unknown origins. NASA's initiative highlights the importance of continuous space surveillance to prevent potential threats from space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa recorded signals on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>The detected radio emissions were at a frequency of 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 70,000,000 kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA activated a working group in August 2025 to analyze the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS system, operated by the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Hawaii, identified comet 3I/ATLAS. This marked the beginning of international scientific interest due to its trajectory and origin.</p>

<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected radio signals from the comet. These emissions suggested the presence of hydroxyl molecules, confirming the comet's classification as an active celestial body.</p>

<p>In August 2025, NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office activated a working group to study the comet, following established protocols for celestial objects of uncertain nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The detection of signals from comet 3I/ATLAS underscores the need for continuous monitoring of celestial objects,” NASA officials said.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “This discovery offers a unique opportunity for detailed observations and may provide insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems,” researchers from the European Space Agency stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object ever recorded, following Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These interstellar objects provide valuable data on the composition and conditions of other stellar systems, enhancing our understanding of astrophysics.</p>

<p>The presence of hydroxyl emissions in 3I/ATLAS confirms its active nature and dispels initial speculation regarding a possible artificial origin for the signals detected. Continuous surveillance and analysis of such objects are crucial for advancing knowledge of planetary formation and organic chemistry in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and collaborating agencies will continue to observe comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. This ongoing research aims to refine existing models of celestial object dynamics and improve predictions regarding the behavior of transiting comets.</p>
