      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb Flags Interstellar Object’s 17th Anomaly Discovered In SPHEREx Data</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has identified the 17th anomaly associated with the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, based on data gathered from NASA's SPHEREx observatory. The findings, published on December 19, 2025, follow the object's perihelion on October 27, 2025, and its close approach to Earth at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units (AU), or approximately 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances our understanding of the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Loeb and his team have documented various anomalies of 3I/ATLAS, raising questions about its origins and characteristics. The research indicates that 3I/ATLAS may not conform to the typical properties of known comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS observatory.</li>
    <li>The object entered perihelion on October 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>It passed Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 AU.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx conducted observations from December 8 to 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>New findings reveal a 20-fold increase in water-gas emissions post-perihelion.</li>
    <li>The next observations of 3I/ATLAS are planned for April 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025. It reached perihelion on October 27, 2025, after which it approached Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 AU. Following its perihelion, NASA's SPHEREx mission conducted observations between December 8 and 15, 2025, leading to the identification of the 17th anomaly by Avi Loeb.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new images of 3I/ATLAS were taken in the wavelength range of 0.75–5.0 microns,” said Loeb. “On these large scales, the brightness maps of dust and organics were found to be pear-shaped, with an anti-tail elongation in the direction of the Sun.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb noted, “Compared to the pre-perihelion data reported from SPHEREx in August 2025, the continuum spectral signature of water-ice absorption has mostly disappeared, replaced by scattered light plus thermal emission from organo-silicaceous dust grains.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third recorded interstellar object, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The peculiar nature of 3I/ATLAS has prompted ongoing research into its composition and potential origins. Previous studies have suggested that interstellar objects may differ significantly from known comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue, with the next scheduled study by SPHEREx set for April 2026, following its rendezvous with Jupiter’s irregular moon Eupheme in March.</p>
