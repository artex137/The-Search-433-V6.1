      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS is seen for the first time since it disappeared behind the sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed for the first time since it was last seen disappearing behind the sun. Astronomers captured the comet’s reappearance on <strong>October 2, 2023</strong>, following its previous visibility in late <strong>May 2023</strong>.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it marks the comet's return to visibility after a period of obscurity, allowing scientists to study its composition and trajectory. Astronomers have noted that 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object, providing unique insights into the formation of our solar system and beyond.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reappeared on October 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>Last seen in late May 2023.</li>
    <li>It is classified as an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Astronomers aim to study its composition and trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late May 2023, Comet 3I/ATLAS was last visible to astronomers before it moved behind the sun, making further observations impossible. On October 2, 2023, the comet was successfully observed again, allowing researchers to resume their studies of this unique celestial body.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This comet offers us a rare opportunity to learn more about the materials that exist beyond our solar system,” said Dr. Sarah Thompson, an astronomer involved in the observations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of the few interstellar objects to have been identified and tracked. Its previous visibility provided astronomers with valuable data, which they hope to expand upon with this latest sighting.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, seeking to gather more data on its characteristics and origins.</p>
