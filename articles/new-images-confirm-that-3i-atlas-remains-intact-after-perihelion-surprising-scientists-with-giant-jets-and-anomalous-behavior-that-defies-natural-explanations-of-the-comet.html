      <h2>New images confirm that 3I/ATLAS remains intact after perihelion</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, taken on November 11, 2025, with the Nordic Optical Telescope, have confirmed that the comet remains intact after its perihelion, exhibiting complex structures including giant jets and an antitail facing the Sun. The images show no signs of fragmentation, surprising scientists who study comet behavior.</p>

<p>The significance of these findings has sparked debate within the scientific community, particularly among researchers like Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist and head of the Galileo Project. He argues that the unusual behavior and structural integrity of 3I/ATLAS challenge traditional understandings of comet physics, suggesting that the comet's features may not align with natural explanations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of images: November 11, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observations: Nordic Optical Telescope, La Palma</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of 3I/ATLAS: 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Mass flow rate of jets: 5 billion tons per month</li>
    <li>Energy required for sublimation of CO₂: 3 x 10<sup>18</sup> joules</li>
    <li>Absorption area needed: over 1,600 square kilometers</li>
    <li>Length of jets: up to 3 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS passed through perihelion two weeks prior to the latest observations. During this time, scientists observed its behavior closely, noting the persistence of giant jets and the lack of fragmentation.</p>
<p>Prior wide-field images had already indicated the presence of large structures extending from the comet, but the new observations have reinforced the idea that 3I/ATLAS is behaving in ways that defy established cometary models.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “This represents a direct challenge to traditional knowledge about comets in the Solar System.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb emphasized, “Insisting on treating 3I/ATLAS like a conventional comet would mean ignoring relevant signs that something different might be happening.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations of comets have typically shown some degree of fragmentation when subjected to intense thermal and tidal forces. The anomalies exhibited by 3I/ATLAS, including its intact structure and the scale of its jets, highlight a significant deviation from expected behavior.</p>
<p>This case has raised questions about the fundamental understanding of comet dynamics and may prompt a reevaluation of existing models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its behavior and investigate the underlying mechanisms driving its anomalous features. The scientific community will likely engage in discussions about the implications of these findings for our understanding of comets.</p>
