      <h2>Is US Waging War Against UFOs? Hellfire Missile Video Reveals MQ-9 Reapers Being Used for Aerial Combat</h2>

<p>A declassified video showing a Hellfire missile striking an unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) has sparked intense debate. The footage, recorded on 30 October 2024 off Yemen's coast, was released during a congressional hearing on Tuesday. The clip features MQ-9 Reaper drones tracking and engaging what lawmakers described as a UAP. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This video raises significant questions about U.S. military operations involving unidentified objects. Lawmakers have expressed concerns about transparency and the potential implications of using drones in aerial combat against UAPs. Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri presented the footage during a House hearing, stating it was obtained from a whistleblower. The Pentagon has not confirmed details about the incident.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video recorded on 30 October 2024 off Yemen's coast.</li>
    <li>Footage shows an MQ-9 Reaper launching a Hellfire missile at an unidentified aerial object.</li>
    <li>The missile strike did not result in a visible explosion.</li>
    <li>Congressman Eric Burlison presented the video during a House hearing on UAP transparency.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon has not confirmed the object's nature or any extraterrestrial links.</li>
    <li>U.S. forces have been intercepting Houthi drones and missiles in the region since late 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 30 October 2024, a video captured an MQ-9 Reaper drone engaging an unidentified aerial phenomenon off the coast of Yemen. The footage was later presented during a congressional hearing on UAP transparency on a Tuesday, where it was discussed by lawmakers including Congressman Eric Burlison. The video quickly gained traction on social media following its release.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the video release, U.S. forces had been actively intercepting Houthi drones and missiles in the region, raising questions about the nature of the aerial engagement shown in the footage.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It kept going, and it looked like the debris was taken with it,” said Congressman Eric Burlison, referring to the footage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We do not have anything to provide on this,” stated a Pentagon defence official.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are definitely being lied to, there's just no doubt about that,” said Florida Congressman Jared Moskowitz.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The footage is significant because it shows MQ-9 Reapers being used in unconventional roles, which raises questions about the rules of engagement in contested zones. In previous incidents, such as a Predator drone firing a Stinger missile at an Iraqi MiG-25 in 2002 and a Reaper test using an AIM-9X missile in 2017, drones have engaged airborne targets, but this represents one of the first public examples involving a Hellfire missile in a live aerial engagement.</p>
<p>The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has previously found no evidence linking UAP incidents to extraterrestrial technology, but the recent video has fueled speculation about potential U.S. military engagement with unidentified objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, investigations into the incident continue, but the U.S. government has not confirmed the nature of the target or any potential implications. Lawmakers are pushing for greater transparency regarding UAP incidents and the military's engagement rules in contested airspace.</p>
