      <h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet 3I/ATLAS</strong> made its closest approach to the sun on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet's current brightness is approximately <strong>magnitude +11</strong>, making it invisible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be near the rocky planet <strong>Venus</strong> in the constellation <strong>Virgo</strong> on <strong>October 31</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Lemmon</strong> has brightened to a magnitude of <strong>+4.2</strong> and can be seen low on the western horizon.</li>
    <li><strong>Comet SWAN</strong> has an estimated magnitude of <strong>7.2</strong> and is not visible without binoculars or a telescope.</li>
    <li>Comet SWAN was discovered by <strong>Vladimir Bezguly</strong> on <strong>September 10, 2025</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has captivated stargazers as it approaches the sun, with its closest approach occurring on October 30, 2025. This interstellar comet is currently located near Venus in the constellation Virgo but is too dim to be seen without equipment. Comets Lemmon and SWAN are also visible this Halloween, with Lemmon potentially bright enough to be seen with the naked eye.</p>

<p>The presence of these comets in the night sky this Halloween has generated excitement among astronomers and stargazers. Observatories and amateur astronomers are actively observing 3I/ATLAS to gather data before it leaves the solar system. The changing brightness of Comet Lemmon and the visibility challenges posed by Comet SWAN have added to the interest in these celestial events.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, marking it as the third interstellar visitor to the solar system. The comet made its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2025. Comet Lemmon has brightened significantly over the month leading up to Halloween, while Comet SWAN was discovered on September 10, 2025, and has been declining in brightness since its close approach to Earth on October 21.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to emerge from behind the glare of the sun by early December, although its brightness will likely decrease significantly,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are remnants from the early solar system that become active when they approach the sun. As they heat up, they develop a gaseous shell that creates a tail, which reflects sunlight. The discovery of new comets continues to provide valuable insights into the formation of our solar system and beyond.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory out of the solar system, astronomers will focus on gathering data on its composition and behavior. Comet SWAN is not expected to return for another 1,400 years after it fades from view.</p>
