      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Baffles Scientists With Anti-Tail and No Dust Trail After Oct. 29 Perihelion</h2>

<p>On November 22, 2025, astronomers in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, observed a faint green smudge through a backyard telescope, identifying it as interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. This unexpected discovery has challenged established scientific understanding of comet behavior and structure.</p>

<p>The findings regarding 3I/ATLAS are significant for the scientific community, prompting researchers to reevaluate their models of comet outgassing and the dynamics of interstellar objects entering the solar system. Astronomers are now conducting further observations to understand the implications of this unusual comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on November 22, 2025, in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.</li>
    <li>The comet displays an anti-tail and lacks a traditional dust trail.</li>
    <li>Researchers are reassessing long-held models about comet structure and behavior.</li>
    <li>The comet's perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, the point in its orbit when it was closest to the Sun. Following this event, astronomers began to observe its unique characteristics, leading to its identification on November 22, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The appearance of 3I/ATLAS is forcing us to reconsider what we know about comets,” said a spokesperson from the astronomical community. “Its behavior is unlike anything we have seen before.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous observations of comets have shown them to typically exhibit dust tails and predictable outgassing patterns. The unusual features of 3I/ATLAS suggest that interstellar comets may behave differently than their solar system counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of established theories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to gather more data and insights into its behavior and characteristics, which may lead to new discoveries about interstellar objects.</p>
