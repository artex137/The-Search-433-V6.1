      <h2>U of A's Mars camera gets close look at comet from interstellar space</h2>

<p>The University of Arizona's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed less than 19 million miles from Mars in early October. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object recorded in our solar system. The unique viewing opportunity arose because the comet was positioned behind the sun from Earth's perspective, making it undetectable by Earth-based telescopes. Scientists expect the images to enhance understanding of the comet's nucleus and the characteristics of its surrounding coma.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed 19 million miles (30 million kilometers) from Mars in early October.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to span 3.5 miles (not disclosed).</li>
    <li>The HiRISE camera has been in operation for nearly two decades, capturing high-resolution images of Mars.</li>
    <li>MRO has been orbiting Mars since 2006.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach its minimum distance from Earth around December 19, remaining about 10 times farther than its distance from Mars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, the HiRISE camera observed and photographed comet 3I/ATLAS. This event marked a rare opportunity for NASA's Mars spacecraft to view an interstellar object. Throughout October, the comet remained too close to the sun from Earth's position to be visible from most telescopes.</p>

<p>On October 4, the Perseverance rover on Mars captured images of 3I/ATLAS using its Mastcam-Z camera system, though it appeared only as a faint smudge due to the long exposure required to detect such a distant object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Observations of interstellar objects are still rare enough that we learn something new on every occasion,” said Shane Byrne, HiRISE principal investigator and professor at the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“To capture a glimpse of a visitor from another star system is extraordinary in itself. To do so from a University of Arizona-led instrument orbiting Mars makes it even more remarkable,” said Tomás Díaz de la Rubia, senior vice president for research and partnerships at the University of Arizona.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The HiRISE camera has previously contributed to significant discoveries on Mars, including the identification of safe landing sites for future missions and monitoring geological phenomena. The MRO has previously observed other interstellar objects, including comet Siding Spring in 2014, which was the first high-resolution image of an object from the Oort Cloud.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing analysis of the HiRISE images may reveal new details about the comet's nucleus and its coma. The ultraviolet camera on another Mars orbiter, MAVEN, is processing data to determine the composition and distribution of gases released by the comet.</p>
