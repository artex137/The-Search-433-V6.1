      <h2>UN confirms planetary defenses will target interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as shocking new images are revealed</h2>

<p>The United Nations has confirmed that Earth's planetary defenses will focus on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS starting on November 27, 2025. A team of global scientists will track the object as it approaches Earth, reaching its closest point on December 19, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it serves as a massive drill for the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) to prepare for potential future threats. While 3I/ATLAS is not expected to pose any danger, the campaign will help refine tracking methods for celestial objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Tracking campaign start:</strong> November 27, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Duration of campaign:</strong> Two months</li>
    <li><strong>Image capture dates:</strong> November 22-24, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Key contributors:</strong> Harvard professor Avi Loeb, amateur astronomers</li>
    <li><strong>IAWN operated by:</strong> UN Office for Outer Space Affairs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA held a press conference to discuss 3I/ATLAS but faced criticism for presenting unclear images of the object. On November 22, amateur astronomers began capturing clearer images, revealing detailed features of the comet.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2025, the UN announced the planetary defense campaign, which will involve tracking 3I/ATLAS until January 2026. The campaign is designed to test and improve observational techniques for future celestial threats.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and high interest to the scientific community,” IAWN stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. Since then, it has raised interest due to its unusual characteristics, including a cometary tail that points toward the sun and changes in color. These anomalies have led some, including Professor Loeb, to speculate about the object's nature.</p>
<p>This campaign is part of a broader effort by the UN and NASA to enhance global preparedness for potential asteroid threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will monitor 3I/ATLAS until January 2026, refining tracking methods. While the UN and NASA affirm the object is a comet, skepticism remains in some circles regarding the nature of the object and the purpose of the campaign.</p>
