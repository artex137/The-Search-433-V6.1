      <h2>New 'spacecraft' 3I/Atlas images show 'anti-tail' for the first time as Earth approach looms</h2>

<p>A mystery object, known as Comet 3I/ATLAS, has displayed an "anti-tail" for the first time as it speeds away from the sun. Amateur astronomer Michael Jaeger of Austria captured images of the comet, which is currently on its predicted trajectory, during his observations last Tuesday. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. The comet, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, is the third known object from outside our solar system. The images show a complex tail structure with multiple jets, prompting theoretical physicist Avi Loeb to suggest the possibility of it being an "extraterrestrial artefact."</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Seven to ten degrees above the horizon</li>
    <li>Number of jets observed: More than seven</li>
    <li>Mass of material calculated: Approximately five billion tonnes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered as it entered the solar system. On the following Tuesday, amateur astronomer Michael Jaeger began tracking the comet and reported the presence of a complex tail structure. His observations included images showing multiple jets emanating from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "We have something unusual to report. 3I/ATLAS showed a complex tail structure early this morning," said Michael Jaeger, the amateur astronomer who captured the images.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "If it's a natural object then we know the temperature on the surface of the rock, given its distance from the sun," stated Avi Loeb regarding the characteristics of the jets.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third known interstellar object discovered in our solar system. Previous encounters with interstellar objects have led to significant scientific discussions regarding their origins and compositions. The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS may provide further insights into these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming weeks, scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS to determine whether it is a natural comet or a technological object. The characteristics of the jets will help clarify its nature as it approaches Earth.</p>
