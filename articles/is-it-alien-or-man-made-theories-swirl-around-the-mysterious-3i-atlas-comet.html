      <h2>Is It Alien or Man-Made? Theories Swirl Around the Mysterious 3I/Atlas Comet</h2>

<p>Scientists have expressed confusion over the unusual behaviour of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS since its discovery on 1 July 2023. Multiple telescopes have reported various data, including a striking image captured by the Two-Meter Twin Telescope in the Canary Islands, which showed a faint anti-tail extending approximately 6 kilometres from the comet's nucleus.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has raised questions among astronomers about the comet's nature and origin. Authorities and researchers are currently investigating the comet's unique characteristics, with some theorising it may be artificial rather than natural. The findings could have implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on 1 July 2023.</li>
    <li>Anti-tail observed measuring approximately 6 km.</li>
    <li>Nickel tetracarbonyl identified as a primary component.</li>
    <li>Plumes emitting four grams of nickel per second detected.</li>
    <li>NASA's Tom Statler states the comet behaves like a natural body.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2023, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS. Since then, various telescopes, including the Two-Meter Twin Telescope and Keck II Telescope, have provided data on its unusual characteristics. The anti-tail was first reported following observations from the Canary Islands, while the presence of nickel tetracarbonyl was noted after images taken in Hawaii. Recent observations from the Gemini South telescope in Chile confirmed the comet's active state, featuring a gassy tail and a glowing dust halo.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is only one place where that is known to exist, and that is in industrially produced nickel alloys,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, the founding director of Harvard University's Black Hole Initiative.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It's a comet,” said Tom Statler, lead scientist for Solar System Small Bodies at NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual activity of 3I/ATLAS has prompted speculation about its origins, with some suggesting it may be of artificial origin. This follows a trend of increasing interest in interstellar objects since the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017, which also sparked debates about the nature of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers expect more theories and observations regarding 3I/ATLAS in the coming days as they continue to study its properties and behaviour.</p>
