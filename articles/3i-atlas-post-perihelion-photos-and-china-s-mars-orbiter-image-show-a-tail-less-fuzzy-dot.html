      <h2>3I/ATLAS post-perihelion photos and China's Mars orbiter image show a tail-less fuzzy dot</h2>

<p>Recent images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have emerged, showing a bright, fuzzy dot in space with no visible tail. The images were captured by various observatories following the comet's perihelion, which occurred on October 29-30, 2023. NASA data indicates that the comet has gained speed and altered its trajectory since the perihelion.</p>

<p>The significance of these findings lies in the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, which has sparked interest among astronomers. Observations reveal that the comet, typically expected to display a long tail, has failed to do so, raising questions about its behavior and composition. As a result, researchers are conducting further studies to understand the comet's peculiarities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29-30, 2023.</li>
    <li>The first image post-perihelion was taken at Lowell Observatory in Arizona.</li>
    <li>The second image was captured by R. Naves Observatory.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) released its image on October 2-3.</li>
    <li>China’s Tianwen-1 orbiter captured its image on October 3, released on November 6.</li>
    <li>No images show a tail; all display a bright coma.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has shown unusual acceleration and trajectory changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025. The comet exhibited signs of a tail on September 2023, as noted during a public outreach initiative by NSF NOIRLab. The comet swung by Mars on October 2-3, where it was observed by multiple orbiters from the US, Europe, and China. Following these observations, the European Space Agency released an image from its TGO, showing a bright coma without a tail. China’s CNSA released an image from the Tianwen-1 orbiter on November 6, which also depicted a tail-less fuzzy dot.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We can’t see the tail in the CaSSIS images, but it may become more visible in future observations as the comet continues to heat up and release more ice,” said a representative from the European Space Agency.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The comet's distinctive features are visible and consist of a nucleus and a surrounding coma, with a diameter reaching several thousand kilometres,” stated the China National Space Administration.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has drawn comparisons to previous comets that exhibited standard tail formations. However, the absence of a tail in this instance is unprecedented and has led to debates within the scientific community regarding its nature and behavior. The comet's rapid acceleration and altered path following its encounter with the Sun further complicate the understanding of its characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are expected to continue in-depth studies of 3I/ATLAS based on the observational data gathered. Future observations may provide additional insights into the comet's behavior and potential tail development as it moves away from the Sun.</p>
