      <h2>NASA’s TESS pivots to track interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS — and the data will be public</h2>

<p>NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has paused its scheduled activities to observe interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, with data expected to be downlinked on January 19 and January 26, 2026. The data will be made available to the public immediately, with no proprietary holdbacks.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025, is the third confirmed interstellar object passing through our solar system. The comet is already moving away from the Sun, which makes the timing critical for capturing valuable data before it dims further.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Observation of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Dates:</strong> Data downlink on January 19 and January 26, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> TESS spacecraft, orbiting Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Initial discovery:</strong> July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> 170 million miles (1.8 astronomical units) from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Special observation period:</strong> January 15 to January 22, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS survey on July 1, 2025, from Rio Hurtado, Chile. NASA’s TESS began its special observation of the comet on January 15, 2026, at approximately 0600 UTC. The observation is scheduled to conclude on January 22, 2026, at around 1200 UTC. The first data downlink is set for January 19, 2026, with a second downlink on January 26, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This object is a comet,” said Amit Kshatriya from NASA, confirming the nature of 3I/ATLAS during a briefing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It is a very precious opportunity to catch the comet in real time,” said Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project, regarding their live stream of the comet.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows a hyperbolic path, indicating it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. Major observatories, including NASA’s Hubble and James Webb space telescopes, have been monitoring the comet. In a November briefing, NASA’s science chief Nicola Fox stated there were no indications of “technosignatures” associated with the object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the special observation period, TESS will return to its regular survey routine. Researchers are looking forward to the first downlinked files and additional tailored data products related to 3I/ATLAS.</p>
