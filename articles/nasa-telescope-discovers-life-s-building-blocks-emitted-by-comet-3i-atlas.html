      <h2>Nasa Telescope Discovers Life’s Building Blocks Emitted by Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA’s SPHEREx space telescope has discovered that comet 3I/ATLAS emitted essential building blocks of life while passing Earth in December 2025. The comet approached within approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) of our planet during its journey around the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it highlights the presence of vital organic molecules such as methanol, cyanide, and methane, which are crucial for biological functions on Earth. However, authorities have noted that these compounds can also be produced through non-biological means, indicating that their presence does not necessarily point to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 137,000 mph (221,000 km/h)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> About 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Publication:</strong> February issue of the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society (AAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Lead Author:</strong> Carey Lisse, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory</li>
    <li><strong>SPHEREx Launch:</strong> March 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. The comet approached Earth in December 2025, emitting vital organic molecules as it passed. SPHEREx, launched in March 2025, observed the comet shortly after its launch, providing critical insights into interstellar comets and the ingredients necessary for life.</p>

<p>During December 2025, the comet experienced a notable eruption of material, which was particularly evident due to the heat from the sun causing its icy surface to sublimate.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fortunate timing of the comet’s flyby has allowed us to gain unique insights into the characteristics of interstellar comets,” said Yoonsoo Bach, the deputy lead author.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS sheds light on the chemical composition of interstellar objects and fuels discussions about the origins of life in the universe,” said Carey Lisse.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of only three recognized interstellar visitors and is believed to be the oldest comet observed to date. The discovery of organic molecules from this comet emphasizes the importance of continued exploration and observation of celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers anticipate further observations of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, with NASA’s Juno spacecraft set to conduct an in-depth study before the comet exits our solar system permanently.</p>
