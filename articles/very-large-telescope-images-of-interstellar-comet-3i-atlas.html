      <h2>Very Large Telescope images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor, has captured attention as it travels through the Solar System, having been discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on 1 July 2025. The comet is notable for originating from deep space and is one of only three interstellar objects identified in our Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it provides insight into celestial bodies from outside our Solar System. The European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile captured images of 3I/ATLAS on the night of 3 July 2025, just two days after its discovery. These images form part of a growing collection of observations that enhance our understanding of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Images captured by the Very Large Telescope on 3 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Location: Atacama Desert, Chile.</li>
    <li>Comet will make closest approach to Earth in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Images available in the ESO archive.</li>
    <li>Other observatories involved: Hubble, Webb, SPHEREx, and Gemini North.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS. Just two days later, on 3 July 2025, the Very Large Telescope captured images of the comet, which were taken over a period of approximately 13 minutes. These images were combined to illustrate the comet's trajectory.</p>

<p>As of now, 3I/ATLAS is approaching the inner Solar System and will be behind the Sun from Earth's perspective in late October 2025. It is expected to reappear in December 2025 as it exits the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These images represent the deepest and best view of the comet we have had to date,” a representative from the European Southern Observatory said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of only three interstellar objects observed in our Solar System, the others being 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such comets helps scientists learn about the formation and evolution of celestial bodies in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory, astronomers will monitor its path closely, preparing for its reappearance in December 2025. Observations from various space and ground-based telescopes will contribute to ongoing research into the nature of interstellar comets.</p>
