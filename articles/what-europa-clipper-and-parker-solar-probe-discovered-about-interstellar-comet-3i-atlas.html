      <h2>What Europa Clipper and Parker Solar Probe discovered about interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper and Parker Solar Probe have observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the solar system. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Warning System (ATLAS), made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.79 astronomical units, or about 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>The observations matter as they provide valuable data on the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. NASA officials stated that this information could lead to comparisons between materials from beyond the solar system and those formed closer to the Sun. The analysis is ongoing, and further results are expected in the future.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 1.79 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Parker Solar Probe observed the comet from October 18 to November 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper performed observations in November 2025, approximately 164 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS expected to be near Jupiter in February 2026.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper launched in October 2024, with an expected arrival at Jupiter in April 2030.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025. The Parker Solar Probe observed the comet from October 18 to November 5, 2025, capturing about ten images while positioned 195 million kilometers closer to the comet than Earth. Following this, the Europa Clipper conducted its observations in November 2025, using its ultraviolet spectrograph to analyze the comet from a distance of 164 million kilometers.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches Jupiter in early 2026, scientists plan to continue analyzing the collected data to better understand its motion and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The WISPR data will help researchers study dust and gas released by the comet as it travels through the inner solar system,” NASA stated regarding the Parker Solar Probe's observations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The measurements done by Europa, UVS, will provide researchers with the information necessary to recognize the comet gases and then compare them with those found in solar system comets,” NASA said about the Europa Clipper's findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The observations of 3I/ATLAS offer a unique opportunity to study the differences between interstellar comets and those formed within the solar system. The ongoing analysis aims to enhance understanding of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the data gathered from both spacecraft. Scientists hope to obtain further observations of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in early 2026, which may provide additional insights into its characteristics and composition.</p>
