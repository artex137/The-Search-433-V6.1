      <h2>3I/ATLAS heads toward NASA spacecraft after reverse thrust</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS is set to pass near NASA's spacecraft in a few weeks after it has reversed its thrust and vanished behind the Sun. The comet will approach both NASA's Europa Clipper and the European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft between October 25 and November 6, 2023.</p>

<p>This event is significant as researchers believe the comet's close trajectory will offer a rare chance to study its ion tail and gather materials from beyond our solar system. This opportunity could enhance understanding of interstellar objects, which are typically difficult to detect and study, according to European researchers in a pre-published study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in June 2023.</li>
    <li>The close pass will occur between October 25 and November 6, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA's Europa Clipper and ESA's Hera spacecraft will be involved in the encounter.</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has raised concerns that 3I/ATLAS might be an alien spacecraft.</li>
    <li>The comet's reverse thrust has added it to NASA's list of potential threats to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in June 2023 and has since exhibited unusual behaviour, including a reverse thrust event that led to its temporary disappearance behind the Sun. As the comet prepares for its close approach to NASA's and ESA's spacecraft, researchers anticipate opportunities for significant scientific discovery.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The encounter with the comet’s ion tail is one of the most interesting possibilities as it will provide a direct sample of materials from beyond our solar system,” researchers noted in a pre-published study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is humanity’s third recorded interstellar visitor. Previous interstellar objects have often gone undetected, appearing only as minor fluctuations in the solar wind. The unique behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has raised considerable interest in both the scientific community and the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will closely monitor the comet's trajectory as it approaches the spacecraft, aiming to collect data that could provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects and their potential impact on Earth.</p>
