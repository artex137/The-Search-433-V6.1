      <h2>Dr. Michio Kaku Warns of Close Monitoring for Comet 3I/ATLAS as It Approaches the Sun</h2>

<p>Dr. Michio Kaku has urged the scientific community and the public to closely monitor the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun on October 29, 2025. Kaku has stated that if the comet exhibits signs of "excess energy" during its flyby, it could indicate the involvement of intelligent life in its trajectory.</p>

<p>This event is significant because 3I/ATLAS is one of the few interstellar objects observed in our solar system. With major agencies like NASA currently hindered by a government shutdown, Kaku emphasizes the need for independent observation and analysis as the comet approaches its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS (also designated C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at closest approach: approximately 1.36 AU (about 203 million km)</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Chile</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 during the ATLAS survey in Chile. As it travels on a hyperbolic trajectory, it is expected to pass through our solar system without being bound by the Sun’s gravity. The comet's closest approach to the Sun is set for October 29, 2025, marking a key moment for observation.</p>
<p>Dr. Kaku has expressed that the behavior of 3I/ATLAS during this close approach could provide vital clues about its origin and whether it has been influenced by intelligent life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If it picks up excess energy, bingo… it means that it’s intelligent life that is guiding the motion of this object,” Dr. Michio Kaku stated, emphasizing the importance of this observation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS are rare and provide unique insights into alien star systems. Recent scientific reports indicate that 3I/ATLAS has a CO₂-dominated coma, which is unusual compared to typical Solar System comets. This complexity raises the possibility of unexpected interactions with the Sun's environment during its approach.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the October 29 date approaches, observatories worldwide, both professional and amateur, are preparing to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely. Observers are advised to watch for signs of sudden energy spikes or changes in the comet’s behavior, as these could indicate something beyond a natural phenomenon.</p>
