      <h2>Inside the Secret UFO Club Accused of Hiding the Truth from America</h2>

<p>A high-profile UAP whistleblower known as Gerb has accused a powerful 'secret club' of managing America's UFO cover-up from behind closed doors. Gerb claims this group links the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a leading science facility, as of 2024.</p>

<p>This matter has raised significant concerns regarding transparency and accountability in UAP investigations. Authorities are now facing scrutiny over the handling of a metallic object recovered in Ohio, which Gerb alleges has been mismanaged to conceal uncomfortable truths about unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Whistleblower: Gerb</li>
    <li>Allegations of a secret club managing UFO information</li>
    <li>Ohio metallic specimen recovered in 2024</li>
    <li>AARO contracted Oak Ridge National Laboratory for analysis</li>
    <li>Claims of conflict of interest involving former AARO chief Sean Kirkpatrick</li>
    <li>Operated by UT-Battelle, linked to Battelle</li>
    <li>Public findings remain classified</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2024, AARO contracted Oak Ridge National Laboratory to analyze a peculiar metallic specimen recovered from private land in Ohio. The material reportedly displayed unusual properties that did not match known earthly alloys.</p>
<p>Later, AARO issued a brief statement suggesting the sample was likely ordinary, which Gerb criticized as politically motivated. Following this, Gerb raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest involving Sean Kirkpatrick, who left AARO in December 2023 to take a senior role at Oak Ridge.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What Gerb has achieved is far more significant than a single metal sample. He has shifted the UFO debate away from blurry skies and towards the corridors of power, where influence, secrecy and corporate ties collide.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Gerb's accusations have intensified debates about transparency in UAP investigations. Critics have accused AARO of functioning as a disinformation entity rather than a truth-seeking organization. The movement between government, academia, and defence labs has been defended as standard practice in national security, but the recent deletions and alterations of official records have heightened public suspicion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the handling of the Ohio specimen and the alleged conflicts of interest are ongoing. The full analysis from Oak Ridge has yet to be released to the public, and further scrutiny of AARO's operations is expected in light of Gerb's revelations.</p>
