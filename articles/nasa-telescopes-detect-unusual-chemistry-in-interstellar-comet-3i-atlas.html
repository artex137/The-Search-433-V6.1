      <h2>NASA telescopes detect unusual chemistry in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has released the first results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) regarding interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, observed on August 6, 2025. The findings, made public on August 25, indicate that the comet's coma is dominated by carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it reveals unusual volatile ratios in the comet, which could enhance understanding of the chemistry of interstellar objects. NASA is coordinating further observations through its JWST, Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) to gather more data on the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed on August 6, 2025.</li>
  <li>Results released on August 25, 2025.</li>
  <li>CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O mixing ratio measured at 8.0 ± 1.0.</li>
  <li>Maximum nucleus diameter estimated at 5.6 km (3.5 miles).</li>
  <li>CO<sub>2</sub> production rate approximately 9.4 × 10<sup>26</sup> molecules per second (69 kg/s).</li>
  <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 AU (270 million km).</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, Hubble Space Telescope conducted observations of 3I/ATLAS, producing the sharpest image of the comet. The comet was subsequently observed by JWST on August 6, 2025, which recorded near-infrared spectra. SPHEREx tracked the comet between August 7 and 15, 2025, detecting strong water-ice absorption features.</p>

<p>Data from these observations culminated in a report submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters, which was released on August 25, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The extreme CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O ratio is atypical for Solar System comets,” said a NASA spokesperson. “The chemistry of 3I/ATLAS most closely resembles that of comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS), considered an outlier.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed passing through the solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Observations of such objects are crucial for planetary defense as well as for understanding the diversity of icy bodies formed in extrasolar environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion on October 29–30, 2025, and during its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>
