      <h2>Unusual composition of comet 3I/ATLAS with elevated CO2 challenges scientists and NASA maintains secrecy</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, has sparked significant debate within the scientific community due to its unusual composition, which features carbon dioxide levels eight times greater than that of water. The comet is set to reach perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding raises fundamental questions about comet formation in different cosmic environments. NASA has limited the release of information regarding 3I/ATLAS due to budget constraints from a government shutdown in the United States. This secrecy contrasts with the urgent need for scientific understanding of the comet as it approaches its closest point to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object to cross the Solar System.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is expected on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's speed is estimated at 245,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>NASA has restricted information sharing due to budget constraints.</li>
    <li>Collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and observatories in Chile is ongoing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers from the ATLAS project in Chile identified 3I/ATLAS, initially classifying it as a possible asteroid. The designation was changed to 3I on July 2, 2025, officially recognizing it as an interstellar object. Subsequent observations on the same day by teams from the Deep Random Survey and Lowell Discovery Telescope confirmed its cometary nature.</p>
<p>On August 6, 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope provided additional data confirming the presence of carbon monoxide in the comet's coma. Observations revealed that the reddish color of the coma intensified over time, suggesting changes in the comet's surface.</p>
<p>NASA's TESS satellite had previously detected sublimation of ices in May 2025, indicating that the comet's activity predates its official discovery.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The high concentration of carbon dioxide suggests that the comet may have formed in an environment with extremely low temperatures,” scientists stated, emphasizing the need for further investigation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual composition of 3I/ATLAS challenges existing theories about the formation of comets, particularly those originating from the Oort cloud or Kuiper belt. Previous studies have shown that comets typically have a different chemical makeup, making this discovery significant for understanding interstellar chemistry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, the international astronomical community continues to collaborate on research efforts. ESA's JUICE mission plans to conduct detailed observations in November 2025. The International Asteroid Warning Network has also initiated an astrometry campaign starting November 27, 2025, to refine the comet's trajectory.</p>
