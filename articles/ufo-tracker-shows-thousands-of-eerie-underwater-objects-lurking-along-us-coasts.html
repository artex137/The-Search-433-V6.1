      <h2>UFO tracker shows thousands of eerie underwater objects lurking along US coasts</h2>

<p>A popular UFO-reporting app, Enigma, has recorded thousands of sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) near US waterways. High-ranking US Navy officials have warned that these phenomena could pose a threat to national security. Since its launch in late 2022, Enigma has received reports of over 30,000 Unidentified Flying Objects and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, with more than 9,000 USO sightings logged as of August 2025.</p>

<p>The significance of these findings has prompted discussions among authorities and experts. The US states with the most reported USO sightings include California and Florida, both of which have extensive coastlines. Retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet has raised concerns that unidentified objects capable of transitioning between air and sea without detection could have profound implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Over 30,000 total UFO sightings reported since late 2022.</li>
  <li>More than 9,000 USO sightings logged within 10 miles of US shorelines.</li>
  <li>500 USO sightings recorded within 5 miles of the coast.</li>
  <li>Most USO sightings reported in California (389) and Florida (306).</li>
  <li>USS Omaha recorded a UFO that vanished into the ocean in July 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late 2022, Enigma launched its UFO-reporting app, amassing a significant database of sightings.</p>
<p>By August 2025, the app had documented over 30,000 UFO sightings, including more than 9,000 USO sightings near US waterways.</p>
<p>In July 2019, the USS Omaha recorded a UFO/UAP that disappeared into the ocean, an incident later verified by the Pentagon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena,” said retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet in a March 2024 report.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Gallaudet further noted, “Pilots, credible observers, and calibrated military instrumentation have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air–sea interface in ways not possible for anything made by humans.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have historically been met with skepticism, often dismissed by the scientific community. However, the recent reports of USOs have garnered attention, particularly in light of the documented patterns of similar phenomena. The USS Omaha incident highlighted the capabilities of these objects, raising concerns about US maritime security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating the reported sightings, with an emphasis on understanding the implications for national security. Further analysis of the data collected by Enigma may provide additional insights into these phenomena.</p>
