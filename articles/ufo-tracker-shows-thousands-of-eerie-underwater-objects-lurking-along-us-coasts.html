      <h2>UFO tracker shows thousands of eerie underwater objects lurking along US coasts</h2>

<p>A UFO-reporting app has recorded thousands of sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) near US waterways, raising concerns from US Navy officials about potential threats to national security. Enigma, the app responsible for the reports, has logged more than 9,000 USO sightings within 10 miles of US shorelines as of August 2023.</p>

<p>This information is significant as high-ranking military officials warn that these sightings may indicate advanced technology capable of moving seamlessly between air and water. Authorities are currently assessing the implications of these reports for national security and maritime safety.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enigma has reported over 30,000 unidentified flying objects and anomalous phenomena since late 2022.</li>
    <li>As of August 2023, there are more than 9,000 USO sightings within 10 miles of US shorelines.</li>
    <li>500 of these sightings occurred within 5 miles of the coast.</li>
    <li>California has recorded 389 USO sightings; Florida has 306.</li>
    <li>One notable report includes video footage of green lights moving underwater.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2019, the USS Omaha recorded a UFO/UAP that disappeared into the ocean after approaching a Navy fleet off San Diego. The Pentagon verified video of this incident, which highlighted capabilities posing risks to U.S. maritime security.</p>
<p>Since launching in late 2022, Enigma has continuously updated its database, prompting increased scrutiny from military experts regarding the nature of these sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena,”</blockquote>
<p>said retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet in a March 2024 report.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have historically been met with skepticism, often dismissed by the scientific community. However, recent reports have generated renewed interest in the possibility of advanced technology operating both in the air and underwater.</p>
<p>Gallaudet noted a documented pattern of similar phenomena, emphasizing that credible observers have recorded objects displaying capabilities beyond known human technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigations into these sightings, evaluating the potential implications for national security and maritime safety. Further reports and analyses may follow as more data becomes available. </p>
