      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Parker Solar Probe Spots Interstellar Comet Hidden Behind the Sun</h2>

<p>The Parker Solar Probe of NASA has observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, capturing images of the comet while it was invisible from Earth between October 18 and November 5. The comet was approximately 209 million km (130 million miles) from the Sun, just outside Mars’ orbit, during this period.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides researchers with a rare opportunity to study the comet's journey near the Sun, which was obscured from Earth due to solar glare. The Parker team stated that these images offer valuable insights into the comet's structure and activity during its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Parker Solar Probe captured images of 3I/ATLAS from October 18 to November 5.</li>
    <li>The comet was about 209 million km (130 million miles) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>WISPR (Wide-field Imager for Parker Solar Probe) took around 10 pictures daily.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was not visible from Earth due to solar glare.</li>
    <li>The spacecraft completed its 25th solar flyby on September 15.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 15, the Parker Solar Probe completed its 25th solar flyby, positioning itself to observe incoming cosmic phenomena. Between October 18 and November 5, the WISPR instrument took images of 3I/ATLAS, allowing researchers to analyze the comet's behavior during a time when it was hidden from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The images provide a precious look at the comet during a period when it was not visible from Earth as it was too close to the Sun,” the Parker team stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this observation, some scientists speculated about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, with theories suggesting it could be an alien probe. However, the Parker Solar Probe's observations have provided crucial data that can help clarify the comet's characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The WISPR team will continue processing the captured images to eliminate unwanted sunlight and synchronize different exposures, aiming to reveal unprecedented details about the comet.</p>
