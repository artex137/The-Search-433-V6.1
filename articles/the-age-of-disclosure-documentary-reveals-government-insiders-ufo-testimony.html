These officials assert that governments have concealed evidence of recovered non-human craft, challenging decades of official government statements. The documentary arrives at a time of heightened public interest in UFOs, now referred to as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), and follows multiple congressional hearings on the subject.</p>
