      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: A Wobbling Jet, Red X-rays, and Earth’s Closest Encounter</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has approached Earth this week, prompting a global observational campaign among astronomers. The comet, one of only a few interstellar objects detected in the solar system, has revealed unexpected features, including a wobbling jet and red X-ray emissions, as it nears its closest point, 175 million miles (282 million km) from Earth.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to enhance our understanding of the chemistry and physics of interstellar objects. Researchers are working collaboratively, pooling data from multiple observatories, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), to analyze the comet's unique characteristics and their implications for planetary formation beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently within 175 million miles (282 million km) of Earth.</li>
  <li>The closest approach is occurring this week.</li>
  <li>A wobbling high-latitude jet has been detected, indicating rapid rotation.</li>
  <li>Red X-ray emissions have been observed, revealing new details about its composition.</li>
  <li>Observatories from NASA, ESA, and the U.N.’s International Asteroid Warning Network are involved in the observation efforts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been on a trajectory toward Earth, with significant observations reported leading up to its closest approach. Initial observations from the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii indicated an intense green hue due to diatomic carbon gas. This was followed by the detection of red X-ray emissions by ESA’s XMM-Newton satellite, providing insight into the comet's interaction with solar radiation.</p>

<p>As the comet continues its journey, astronomers have mobilized telescopes worldwide to capture its changing appearance and behavior. Public interest has surged, with many amateur astronomers sharing images and live streams of the event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The rapid rotation, the wobbling jet, and the high-energy emissions may help answer long-standing questions about how interstellar objects survive their journey,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Further analysis of the red X-ray glow is expected to yield new insights into the comet’s elemental makeup,” remarked an ESA scientist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS follows the passage of another interstellar comet, 2I/Borisov, in 2019. Each encounter offers a unique opportunity to study materials that may differ significantly from those found in our solar system. The scientific community aims to refine techniques for future interstellar visitors, improving detection and analysis methods.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After the closest approach, scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to track any changes in its trajectory and behavior. Ongoing analysis of its emissions and composition is expected to yield new findings about the building blocks of planets and stars beyond our sun.</p>
