      <h2>Avi Loeb to Newsmax: 3I/ATLAS Brightens, Turns Blue</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has reported that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shown unexpected behavior, including increased brightness and a shift to a bluer hue. Loeb made the comments during an interview on Newsmax on Thursday, raising concerns about the delay in the release of key images taken during the object’s Mars fly-by on October 2.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it challenges existing theories about comet behavior. Loeb stated that the brightness of 3I/ATLAS exceeds that of previous comets from the solar system, prompting further investigation by scientific teams monitoring the object. The astrophysicist emphasized the need to understand the physics behind the blue coloration of the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a Harvard astrophysicist.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The object passed by Mars on October 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb reported significant brightness and a blue hue.</li>
    <li>NASA has not yet released high-resolution images from the Mars fly-by.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. It made its closest approach to Mars on October 2, 2025. Following this fly-by, Avi Loeb reported unexpected changes in the object's brightness and color during an interview on October 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As of this morning, we have a report that the object got much brighter than expected, much brighter than any previous comet from the solar system did as it approached the sun’s perihelion,” Loeb said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The color of the object is blue, bluer than the sun. And that’s very surprising... The blue color is something we need to understand,” he added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is not good scientific behavior,” Loeb said regarding the delay in the release of images by NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. While mainstream scientists assert that its behavior aligns with that of a natural comet, Loeb's observations have raised questions about the object's characteristics and the implications of its unexpected brightness and color.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientific teams will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for further developments following the observations made by Loeb. Investigations into the physics behind the object's unusual properties are ongoing, and the release of the Mars fly-by images by NASA is anticipated.</p>
