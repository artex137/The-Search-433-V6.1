      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery Deepens: SETI Scientist Gets Millions of Signals — But No Aliens, Unfortunately</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is currently moving out of our solar system, concluding its two-year journey across space. Despite this unremarkable fact, some observers continue to speculate that the comet may be a piece of alien technology, according to various sources. Major space agencies, including NASA, have classified the object as a comet, while scientists emphasize the need for concrete evidence in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This ongoing debate highlights the tension between sensational speculation and scientific rigor. Researchers at the SETI Institute are conducting detailed searches for technosignatures, which are signs of technology from beyond Earth. They continue to sift through vast amounts of data to filter out signals from human technology, underscoring the challenges in the pursuit of identifying extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Classification: Common comet by NASA</li>
    <li>Origin: An interstellar solar system beyond our own</li>
    <li>Current status: Moving out of our solar system</li>
    <li>Key researchers: Leslie Looney, Sofia Sheikh</li>
    <li>SETI Institute location: Silicon Valley</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been traveling through our solar system for two years. Its journey has sparked debates about whether it could be an alien craft. NASA has classified it as a comet, a classification supported by scientists such as Leslie Looney. The SETI Institute has been actively searching for technosignatures, focusing on distinguishing between human-made signals and potential extraterrestrial communications.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It's acting just like a piece of rock and ice would,” said Leslie Looney, professor of astronomy at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I get millions of technological signals in a night, and I have not found millions of aliens, unfortunately,” stated Sofia Sheikh, a technosignature research scientist at the SETI Institute.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The search for extraterrestrial life has been ongoing since the 1960s. Despite advances in technology and methods, researchers still face challenges due to the vastness of space. The scientific community adheres to the principle that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” a sentiment echoed by many in the field.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS and other cosmic objects. The SETI Institute plans to enhance its search for technosignatures, utilizing improved computing power and telescope technology to cover larger areas of the sky.</p>
