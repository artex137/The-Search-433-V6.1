      <h2>NASA confirms: The mysterious object passing through our solar system is a comet</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that the object previously considered mysterious, known as 3I/ATLAS, is a comet. This announcement follows the release of long-awaited images taken by NASA spacecraft, which occurred during the comet's pass near Mars on Wednesday, October 25, 2023.</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it puts to rest speculation regarding the object's nature. The agency has conducted extensive analysis using images from three of its spacecraft, including the Mars rover Perseverance. NASA aims to understand the comet's composition and the potential for signs of life in the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object identified as 3I/ATLAS, confirmed as a comet.</li>
    <li>Discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars was 18 million miles.</li>
    <li>Images taken by HiRISE, MAVEN, and Perseverance spacecraft.</li>
    <li>NASA press conference held on October 25, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The object 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2023. Speculation about its nature grew, with some suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft. NASA's confirmation came on October 25, 2023, when images were released showing the comet during its close approach to Mars.</p>
<p>NASA's HiRISE camera captured images of the comet, revealing a hazy white ball, or coma, composed of dust and ice. The MAVEN spacecraft photographed the comet using ultraviolet cameras to identify emitted hydrogen. The Perseverance rover also captured images through its Mastcam-Z camera.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, a senior NASA official, stated, "We really want to find signs of life in the universe… but 3I/ATLAS is a comet."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard professor Avi Loeb expressed skepticism, saying, "Of course it could be natural, but we have to consider the possibility that it is technological, because if it is, the consequences for humanity will be huge."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Researcher Thomas Puzia, who led the discovery team, said, "All the facts point to a normal object coming from interstellar space. This comet is very special in its nature, but it can be explained by physics."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The speculation surrounding 3I/ATLAS was fueled by interest from various public figures, including celebrity Kim Kardashian, who sought clarification from NASA. The debate over the object's identity reflects broader public fascination with potential extraterrestrial life and the scientific community's commitment to investigating such claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the images and data collected from the three spacecraft to better understand 3I/ATLAS's composition and its journey through interstellar space.</p>
