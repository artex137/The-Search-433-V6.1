      <h2>Mysterious Interstellar Visitor Reaches Perihelion Today</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has reached its perihelion, coming within 126 million miles of the Sun today. The object, which astronomers discovered in July, has sparked interest due to theories about its origins, particularly claims by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb regarding its possible connection to an alien civilization. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The perihelion of 3I/ATLAS is significant for astronomers as it may provide insights into the object's composition and behavior. Loeb argues that this moment is ideal for detecting any potential acceleration or deceleration caused by an external force, such as an engine, thanks to the Sun's gravitational pull. Authorities are monitoring the object closely, although it is currently obscured by the Sun from Earth-based observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion distance:</strong> 126 million miles (approximately 203 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Expected close approach to Venus:</strong> March 2024, within 60 million miles (approximately 97 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Key theorist:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astronomer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023, leading to widespread interest in its unusual characteristics. Since then, astronomers have debated its nature, with Loeb proposing that it could be an artificial object. Today, the object reached its closest point to the Sun, prompting renewed scrutiny of its behavior and composition.</p>

<p>In March 2024, 3I/ATLAS is set to pass near Venus, which will provide an opportunity for the European Space Agency’s Jupiter-bound JUICE mission to observe it more closely.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "This is the optimal time for either acceleration or deceleration by an impulse from an engine, thanks to the gravitational assist from the Sun." He also noted, "We cannot observe 3I/ATLAS from Earth at this opportune time as it’s currently passing behind the Sun."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is not the first interstellar object to attract attention. Previous discoveries have prompted discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. Loeb's theories, while controversial, reflect ongoing interest in the implications of such objects for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory through the solar system, astronomers will attempt to analyze its behavior and gather data during its close approach to Venus in March. Observations during this period may help clarify its origins and characteristics.</p>
