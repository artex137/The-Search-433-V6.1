      <h2>3I/ATLAS's Close Pass With Sun and Venus Sparks Rare Cosmic Buzz</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make a close pass by the Sun and Venus in late 2025. The event has generated excitement among astronomers and the public, but scientists emphasize that the comet poses no threat to Earth and offers a unique opportunity to study material from beyond our Solar System.</p>

<p>The comet, officially designated 3I/ATLAS, was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. It is only the third known interstellar object to enter our Solar System, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike typical Solar System comets, 3I/ATLAS travels on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originated from outside the Sun's gravitational influence. Observations from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope show that it contains water-ice, carbon dioxide, and metallic dust, setting it apart from native comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> 1 July 2025 by ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Close pass date:</strong> 3 November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometres (170 million miles) on 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Exceeding 70,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Solar conjunction:</strong> 21 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> 29 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Venus distance:</strong> About 97 million kilometres (60 million miles)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS will enter solar conjunction on 21 October 2025, disappearing briefly behind the Sun from Earth's perspective. It will reach perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on 29 October 2025. The comet will then pass approximately 97 million kilometres from Venus on 3 November 2025.</p>

<p>Following its close pass, the comet is expected to be observed again when it re-emerges from behind the Sun in early December 2025. Scientists plan to analyze its behavior during these significant events.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The scientific interest lies in how this comet behaves under extreme solar conditions,” said NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office. “3I/ATLAS gives us a real-world opportunity to test observation and modelling techniques for fast-moving interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS will not come close enough to pose a threat,” NASA confirmed in its latest fact sheet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in our Solar System, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unusual composition and trajectory have sparked interest among scientists, although most experts agree it is a natural interstellar body.</p>

<p>The comet's passage provides a landmark event for planetary science, allowing researchers to study how interstellar material responds to solar heating and planetary gravity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will resume observations of 3I/ATLAS once it re-emerges from behind the Sun in early December 2025. Researchers aim to learn more about the comet's behavior and contribute to the understanding of how interstellar objects form and evolve.</p>
