      <h2>Father and Son Film UFOs in Geraldton, Australia</h2>

<p>A father and son have filmed a trio of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the night sky in Geraldton, Australia, on September 10, 2025. Shane Plane and his son, Brad, captured the unusual lights while driving along a road in the coastal city.</p>

<p>This sighting is part of a series of unexplained aerial phenomena reported in the region. Local authorities, including the Perth Observatory, are investigating the incidents as multiple sightings have been documented across Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: September 10, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Geraldton, Western Australia</li>
    <li>Sighters: Shane Plane and his son, Brad</li>
    <li>Duration of sighting: Over half an hour</li>
    <li>Observatory involvement: Perth Observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 10, 2025, while driving, Shane Plane noticed a peculiar star in the sky. He and his son decided to go to the beach for a better view. Upon arrival, they observed three bright lights moving in a triangular formation. One light eventually separated from the group, moving upwards and slowing near another light.</p>

<p>Brad noted that the lights resembled flares but argued that flares cannot sustain such movement and duration. Shane expressed skepticism about conventional explanations, leaving the possibility of extraterrestrial origins open.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "It's very, very confusing," said Matt Woods from the Perth Observatory, who has received similar reports from multiple sources in the region.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "It's going to be interesting to see what it winds up being, if we do find out what it is," Woods added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Recent weeks have seen a spike in UFO sightings across the Midwest and coastal areas of Western Australia. The Perth Observatory has been actively gathering reports and investigating these anomalies.</p>

<p>Authorities have ruled out conventional air traffic as a cause, suggesting the possibility of experimental devices or drone trials as alternatives.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations by the Perth Observatory and other local authorities are ongoing. The outcomes of these inquiries may provide clarity on the recent sightings in the region.</p>
