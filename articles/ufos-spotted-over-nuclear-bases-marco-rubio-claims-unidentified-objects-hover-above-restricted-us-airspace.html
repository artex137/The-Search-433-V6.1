      <h2>UFOs Spotted Over Nuclear Bases? Marco Rubio Claims Unidentified Objects Hover Above Restricted US Airspace</h2>

<p>In a recent revelation, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has claimed that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have repeatedly hovered over restricted nuclear facilities in the United States. This assertion came to light in the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, which is set to premiere on Prime Video on November 21, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to these sightings.</p>

<p>This matter raises significant questions about national security and the potential for extraterrestrial activity. Authorities are currently reviewing the claims made in the documentary, which features testimonies from 34 US officials, including former UAP Task Force head Jay Stratton. Rubio has stated that these objects are “not ours,” suggesting a possible cover-up surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, Marco Rubio made headlines with his claims about UFOs hovering over restricted nuclear facilities during a trailer release for the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>. The documentary is said to explore an 80-year history of alleged government cover-ups regarding non-human intelligence and reverse-engineered alien technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities — and it’s not ours,” Rubio stated in the documentary trailer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Director Dan Farah has called for increased government transparency regarding these incidents, labeling the situation as “the biggest disinformation campaign in US history.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This recent claim by Rubio adds to a growing body of evidence and speculation regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. Previous reports and investigations into UFO sightings have sparked discussions about the implications for national security and the potential presence of extraterrestrial life. The UAP Task Force, established to investigate such phenomena, has been criticized for its lack of transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the documentary's release, officials may increase scrutiny of reported UFO sightings. Investigations into the claims made by Rubio and the officials interviewed in the documentary could lead to further inquiries into the nature of these unidentified objects.</p>
