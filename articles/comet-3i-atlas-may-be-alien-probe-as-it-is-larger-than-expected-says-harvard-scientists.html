      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS may be alien probe as it is larger than expected, says Harvard scientists</h2>

<p>Scientists have identified an unusual interstellar object, named 3I/ATLAS, which was first spotted by NASA on 1 July 2025. This object is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb and his team have suggested that it may be larger than previously estimated, with a solid nucleus possibly over 5 kilometres in diameter.</p>

<p>This discovery raises critical questions about the nature of interstellar objects and their implications for our understanding of the universe. Authorities, including NASA and various scientific institutions, are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as they analyze its trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First spotted: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: over 5 kilometres</li>
    <li>Mass: exceeding 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: within 1.67 million miles</li>
    <li>Current status: under close observation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed by NASA on 1 July 2025. Following its discovery, scientists began to study its motion and characteristics, noting its unusual path through the solar system. In recent analyses, Loeb's team calculated its non-gravitational acceleration and mass, which prompted discussions about its potential origins and purpose.</p>

<p>As the object approaches Mars, researchers continue to investigate its properties and implications. The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is expected to bring it close to several planets, including Venus and Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "3I/ATLAS is exceptional, noting the scarcity of interstellar objects detected compared to expectations from the distribution of heavy elements in space."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also raised the possibility, saying, "Could 3I/ATLAS be an active intelligence technological artefact?"</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects has been rare, with only two confirmed visitors prior to 3I/ATLAS. The detection of such objects is crucial for understanding the distribution of materials in space and the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<p>Previous studies of interstellar objects have raised questions about their origins and the possibility of intelligent design. The unusual features of 3I/ATLAS have reignited these discussions among the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars, analyzing its characteristics and trajectory. Further studies may shed light on the nature of interstellar objects and their implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>
