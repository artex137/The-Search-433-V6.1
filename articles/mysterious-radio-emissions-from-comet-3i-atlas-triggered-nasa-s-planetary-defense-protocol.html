      <h2>Mysterious radio emissions from comet 3I/ATLAS triggered NASA’s planetary defense protocol</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has prompted NASA to activate its planetary defense protocol following the detection of unusual radio emissions. This event occurred in 2025 as the comet passed through the solar system, leading to an international effort to monitor its trajectory and analyze its composition. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This activation marks a significant test for global planetary surveillance systems. Authorities have mobilized observatories worldwide to study the comet's characteristics and behavior, reinforcing readiness against potential celestial threats. Although the comet posed no risk of collision, the event has been essential for assessing international collaborative capabilities in planetary defense.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>The comet travels at approximately 100,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected radio emissions on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) facilitated real-time data sharing during the event.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System identified the comet 3I/ATLAS. Its passage through the solar system initiated a global monitoring campaign. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected significant radio emissions, confirming the presence of hydroxyl molecules, a key indicator of water ice. Following this, NASA activated its planetary defense protocol and coordinated with international observatories.</p>

<p>By December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS approached Earth at a safe distance, allowing scientists to focus on data collection and analysis without the threat of impact. The event highlighted the effectiveness of established warning networks and the necessity for continued international collaboration.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA’s activation of the planetary defense protocol represented a proactive demonstration of capability and readiness,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This event has allowed us to collect invaluable data on interstellar bodies.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS follows previous efforts to monitor celestial objects, such as the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov. While Borisov exhibited predictable behavior, 3I/ATLAS displayed erratic activity, classified as "hyperactive" due to its intense gas and dust emissions. This suggests a more diverse population of interstellar bodies than previously understood.</p>

<p>The event has emphasized the growing importance of radio telescopes in planetary defense, as they can provide unique data about an object's chemical composition and activity that optical telescopes may miss.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Continued analysis of the data collected from 3I/ATLAS will enhance scientific understanding of cometary processes and improve models predicting the orbits of potentially hazardous objects. The experience gained will be critical for future planetary protection efforts and international collaboration in addressing cosmic threats.</p>
