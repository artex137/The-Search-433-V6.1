      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Harvard Expert Flags 'Symmetric' Triple Jets as Possible Tech Signature</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS has entered a controversial phase of scrutiny following the release of images in January 2026 that reveal a precise 'triple-jet' structure emerging from its core. Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar comet's behaviour may not be entirely natural. NASA continues to classify 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet, but the new findings have intensified debate among astronomers.</p>

<p>The significance of these findings lies in their potential implications for our understanding of celestial bodies. As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, its behaviour has become increasingly volatile, transforming it into one of the most closely monitored space phenomena of the decade.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Images revealing the triple-jet structure were taken in January 2026.</li>
    <li>The jets are separated by exactly 120 degrees, a geometry considered unusual for comets.</li>
    <li>Professor Avi Loeb claims this structure challenges the understanding of cometary outgassing.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to have a close encounter with Jupiter's moon Eupheme in March 2026.</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration observed is significantly higher than previously modelled.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has become the most studied object in space history.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Initially, it was considered a typical interstellar comet. However, as it neared the Sun, its behaviour became increasingly erratic. In January 2026, new images revealed a symmetrical triple-jet structure, prompting a reevaluation of its nature.</p>

<p>As the object continues its journey, astronomers are preparing for its close approach to Jupiter's moon Eupheme in March 2026, with telescopes worldwide focused on capturing this rare event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The moment the data became clear was completely transformative,” said Dr Elena Vance, a key researcher involved in the imaging project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Professor Loeb noted that the precise geometry of the jets poses a challenge to conventional explanations, calling it "puzzling" and difficult to explain by random ice pockets.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has drawn comparisons to previous interstellar objects such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike 'Oumuamua, which remained silent, and 2I/Borisov, which behaved like a traditional comet, 3I/ATLAS exhibits hybrid characteristics. The discovery of its triple-jet structure suggests a more complex internal structure than previously thought.</p>

<p>This phenomenon raises questions about the nature of objects in space and their potential geological activity, which may be more dynamic than scientists have understood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, astronomers will continue to monitor its behaviour closely. The ongoing discussion regarding its classification as a natural comet or a potential technosignature is likely to evolve as new data becomes available.</p>
