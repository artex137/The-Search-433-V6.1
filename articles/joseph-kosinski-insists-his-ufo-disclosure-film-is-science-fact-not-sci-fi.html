      <h2>Joseph Kosinski Insists His UFO Disclosure Film Is Science Fact, Not Sci-Fi</h2>

<p>Joseph Kosinski has announced plans for a UFO disclosure thriller, asserting it is based on science fact and not science fiction. The film, which is expected to begin production soon, will feature a narrative centered on national security insiders uncovering a covert government program related to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>This project is significant as it reflects the growing mainstream interest in UFOs, particularly following recent congressional hearings and revelations from former U.S. military officials. Kosinski aims to present a grounded portrayal of the subject, distinguishing his film from other sci-fi interpretations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Director: Joseph Kosinski</li>
    <li>Producer: Jerry Bruckheimer</li>
    <li>Screenwriter: Zach Baylin</li>
    <li>Executive Producer: David Grusch, former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer</li>
    <li>Production Company: Apple Original Films</li>
    <li>Film Style: Thriller, based on real events</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, a New York Times report revealed the Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. This program was followed by multiple declassified Navy videos showing unidentified fast-moving objects. Congressional hearings in 2022 and 2023 involved national security officials discussing UAPs. In 2023, David Grusch made headlines by alleging that the U.S. government has been recovering and studying non-human craft.</p>

<p>Joseph Kosinski has stated that he and Bruckheimer are collaborating with key figures in the UAP conversation and are working to finalize the film's production timeline.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You think it is science fiction, but I think we are finding out it is science facts,” Kosinski said during an interview on Deadline's Behind the Lens with Pete Hammond.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, UFOs have often been dismissed as fringe topics. However, the shift in terminology to UAPs and recent disclosures have elevated the conversation into mainstream media. The renewed interest has led to various projects exploring the subject, including Steven Spielberg's forthcoming film, Disclosure Day, which leans more heavily into science fiction.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Kosinski and his team are preparing to begin production on the UFO thriller, with specific timelines and additional details yet to be disclosed. The film's release will likely coincide with the ongoing public interest in UAPs and government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
