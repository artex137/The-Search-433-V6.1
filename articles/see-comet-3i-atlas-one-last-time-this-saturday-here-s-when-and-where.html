      <h2>See Comet 3I/ATLAS One Last Time This Saturday — Here’s When And Where</h2>

<p>Skywatchers will have a final opportunity to view Comet 3I/ATLAS on Saturday, January 16, 2026, as it moves away from the sun and out of the solar system. The comet, which has captured public interest since its discovery in 2025, will be visible in the pre-dawn sky for those equipped with the proper telescopes.</p>

<p>The comet, initially named A11pl3Z when discovered on July 1, 2025, has been part of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey. It has garnered attention due to its unique characteristics, including its hyperbolic orbit that indicates it is not bound to the sun. Authorities and astronomers are encouraging the public to take advantage of this last viewing opportunity before the comet disappears permanently from sight.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Final viewing date:</strong> January 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Viewing time:</strong> 4:00 p.m. EST (21:00 UTC)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Visible in the pre-dawn sky in the Northern Hemisphere</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope requirements:</strong> 8-inch digital telescope to image; 16-inch optical telescope to see</li>
    <li><strong>Live feed:</strong> Offered by the Virtual Telescope Project from Manciano, Italy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Deep Random Survey remote telescope in Chile. It was initially designated A11pl3Z before being renamed C/2025 N1 ATLAS upon confirmation as a comet. The object was later classified as 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third interstellar object observed after 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>In early January 2026, astronomers confirmed the comet's hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is merely passing through the solar system. A live online observation event is scheduled for January 16, 2026, at 4:00 p.m. EST, where viewers can watch the comet through a robotic telescope.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Take one last look at 3I/ATLAS; it comes from the center of the Milky Way — and it will never be seen again,” said an astronomer involved in the observation efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been the subject of various theories since its discovery, including speculation by Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft. However, scientific data has confirmed its status as a comet, supported by findings from NASA's Psyche mission and ESA's Mars Trace Gas Orbiter.</p>

<p>The comet's behavior, including its acceleration due to outgassing, aligns with known cometary activity within the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its final appearance, Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue its trajectory away from the solar system, never to be seen again. Astronomers will continue to study its path and characteristics through available data.</p>
