      <h2>Was 3I/ATLAS sent by aliens? Why the comet from another world continues to baffle</h2>

<p>When astronomers first spotted 3I/ATLAS on 1 July 2025 using the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, they identified it as an extraordinary interstellar object. 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar comet, after ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. It has generated significant interest due to its icy core surrounded by a coma, a luminous halo of gas and dust.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it challenges current understanding of comet behaviour and raises questions about the nature of interstellar objects. NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet, and its unique features have led to speculation about potential signs of alien technology, particularly from scientists like Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Interstellar, not bound to the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> Late October 2025 (perihelion)</li>
    <li><strong>Significant Observations:</strong> 4 arcseconds off predicted trajectory</li>
    <li><strong>Colour Change:</strong> Shift from reddish to deep blue</li>
    <li><strong>Brightening Event:</strong> Observed before perihelion</li>
    <li><strong>NASA Statement:</strong> No threat to life on Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. It was confirmed as an interstellar comet, prompting extensive observation. In late October 2025, the comet reached its closest point to the Sun, leading to unusual behaviours, including non-gravitational acceleration and a significant colour shift. Following these observations, Professor Avi Loeb suggested that the comet's behaviours could indicate technological features.</p>

<p>In November 2025, public interest surged with discussions from pop culture figures, including Kim Kardashian and Elon Musk, who speculated about the implications of the comet's size and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth.” 
    <br>— Sean Duffy, NASA acting administrator
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The non-gravitational acceleration might be the technological signature of an internal engine.” 
    <br>— Professor Avi Loeb
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects had been confirmed: ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These discoveries have prompted scientists to explore the characteristics of objects from outside our solar system. The unusual behaviours of 3I/ATLAS have reignited debates about the possibility of advanced technology beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As astronomers continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, they will look for signs of a massive gas cloud around the comet in December. This observation may help clarify the reasons behind its unusual acceleration and colour changes.</p>
