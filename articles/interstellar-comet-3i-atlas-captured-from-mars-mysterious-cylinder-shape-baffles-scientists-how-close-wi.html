      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Captured from Mars</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, one of only three interstellar objects detected in our solar system, has been captured in images taken by NASA’s Mars Perseverance rover. The comet was observed approximately 38 million kilometres from Mars earlier this month, sparking interest among scientists and the public alike.</p>

<p>Scientists have been working to determine the size and physical characteristics of comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through our solar system. The urgency for closer observation stems from the comet's trajectory, which will soon take it out of sight. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, plan to utilize orbiters around Mars and Jupiter for additional observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in July.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at approximately 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Its nucleus is estimated to be between 300 metres and 1,100 metres wide.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be about 170 million miles away.</li>
    <li>It will pass within 130 million miles of the Sun on October 30.</li>
    <li>The image captured by the Perseverance rover shows a bright cylindrical object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. The Minor Planet Center confirmed its interstellar origins and classified it as a comet. As the comet continued its journey, it was observed moving at high speeds, leading to further interest and study. In March 2023, the Perseverance rover captured an image of the comet, which has since generated discussions about its unusual shape.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, stated, “The unusual shape seen in recent photos does not provide definitive evidence that 3I/ATLAS is a spaceship.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted that the image captured by the Perseverance rover was taken “at a spatial scale of about 12,500 kilometres at the distance of 3I/ATLAS from Mars.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as it is one of only three confirmed interstellar objects in our cosmic neighbourhood. Its discovery has prompted a flurry of research as scientists seek to better understand its characteristics and origins. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have similarly sparked intrigue and debate regarding their nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Observations from orbiters around Mars and Jupiter are planned to gather more data before the object leaves the solar system.</p>
