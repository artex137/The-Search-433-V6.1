      <h2>Golf-Hovland's golf game gets lift-off from UFO obsession</h2>

<p>Norwegian golfer Viktor Hovland has revealed that his fascination with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) has contributed to his improved performance in golf, particularly ahead of the Ryder Cup taking place in Farmingdale, New York, this week. Hovland's comments came on September 25, a day after teammate Ludvig Aberg discussed Hovland's cosmic interests with the media.</p>

<p>Hovland, currently ranked world number 12, has turned to exploring UFOs as a way to alleviate the pressures of professional golf.
