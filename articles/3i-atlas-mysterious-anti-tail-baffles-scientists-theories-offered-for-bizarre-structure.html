      <h2>3I/ATLAS mysterious anti-tail baffles scientists — Theories offered for bizarre structure</h2>

<p>New photos of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have revealed a mysterious anti-tail and at least two cometary jets, prompting scientists to investigate the unusual characteristics of this celestial object. The latest images come as astronomers continue to study the comet, which is currently traversing our solar system and is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>The findings surrounding 3I/ATLAS are significant as they challenge existing knowledge about comet behaviour. Researchers from various institutions are analyzing the data to understand the comet's jets and anti-tail, which are not common features for typical comets. The investigation aims to clarify whether the observed phenomena stem from natural processes or other explanations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS displays an anti-tail pointing toward the Sun.</li>
    <li>At least two long jets have been observed moving away from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Photos have been captured by astronomers worldwide, including Teerasak Thaluang from Thailand.</li>
    <li>David Jewitt and Jane Luu from UCLA have proposed theories regarding the comet's behaviour.</li>
    <li>Harvard scientists Eric Keto and Avi Loeb have suggested alternative explanations involving ice fragments and technological thrusters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent observations of 3I/ATLAS have revealed a complex structure with an anti-tail and multiple jets. The comet is currently on a trajectory through the solar system, with significant photographic evidence emerging from various locations, including Thailand.</p>
<p>Scientists have engaged in discussions regarding the unusual characteristics of the comet, considering various theories to explain the phenomena. The next notable date for observation will be in December 2025, when the comet approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anti-tail might come from much larger dust grains, which could be around 100 µm in radius,” said David Jewitt, a researcher at UCLA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Future spectroscopic data will enable calibration of the outflow speed and distinction between natural outgassing and artificial jets,” stated Avi Loeb from Harvard.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS is particularly intriguing as it deviates from typical cometary activity. Standard comets usually exhibit tails that extend away from the Sun, driven by solar radiation pressure acting on small dust grains. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS may prompt a reevaluation of comet formation and behaviour in interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December 2025. Upcoming observations and analyses will aim to provide clarity on the comet's jets and anti-tail and determine whether they result from natural phenomena or artificial sources.</p>
