      <h2>Astronomers Detect First Ever Radio Signal from 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Space astronomers have detected the first radio signal from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa on October 24, 2025. This discovery confirms the comet's nature and provides insights into objects from beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>This detection is significant because it enhances our understanding of interstellar objects. The MeerKAT telescope has captured important data about 3I/ATLAS, particularly regarding its outgassing behavior, which occurs as the comet approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of detection: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of telescope: MeerKAT, South Africa</li>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Detection of hydroxyl (OH) molecules confirmed</li>
    <li>Previous detection attempts: Late September 2025</li>
    <li>Type of object: Third confirmed interstellar visitor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late September 2025, astronomers at MeerKAT attempted to detect radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS but were unsuccessful. On October 24, 2025, they successfully captured the first radio signal from the comet, just after it reached perihelion.</p>
<p>The radio waves detected contained absorption features consistent with hydroxyl molecules, confirming that the comet is emitting water vapor as it is heated by solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The absorption features are consistent with the expected OH level population due to the heliocentric velocity of the comet,” said one of the researchers involved in the study.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb stated, “Given that 3I/ATLAS was separated from the Sun by 1.38 times the Earth-Sun separation, its surface temperature was smaller than that of Earth by roughly the square root of 1.38.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is not the first interstellar object detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The significance of these discoveries lies in their potential to provide insights into the conditions of other star systems, as interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS have traveled through the galaxy for billions of years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study the data from the MeerKAT telescope to learn more about the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS as it passes through our solar system.</p>
