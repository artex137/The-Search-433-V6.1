      <h2>Amateur Astronomer Captures Striking 3I/ATLAS Images Hours Before Solar Conjunction</h2>

<p>Private astronomer Dobsonian Power has captured significant images of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS on October 20, 2025, just hours before the comet disappeared behind the Sun from Earth's vantage point. Using a solar telescope, Power documented unusual structural features of the comet while working from coordinates provided by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>

<p>This event highlights the role of citizen science, particularly during a time when NASA's public outreach and data distribution have been severely limited due to a government shutdown. As a result, independent observers have become essential for real-time information on one of only three confirmed interstellar objects detected in our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: October 20, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Photographer: Dobsonian Power</li>
    <li>Method: Solar telescope, raw unprocessed images</li>
    <li>NASA's data distribution: Limited due to government shutdown</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 20, 2025, Dobsonian Power used a solar telescope to capture images of 3I/ATLAS as it approached solar conjunction. He worked from coordinates provided by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The images, taken shortly before the comet became obscured by the Sun, revealed unusual structural features that differ from typical cometary characteristics.</p>

<p>Power emphasized that his images are raw data, without any manipulation or enhancement, providing an unfiltered view of the comet. This approach contrasts with professional observatory images, which are often heavily processed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No matter how modern and complex the telescopes, space rovers, satellites, and high-powered Earth-based instruments that space agencies control, there is still a critical need for citizen astronomers to continue monitoring our skies,” said James Wes, an astronomy education advocate.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019. Both previous objects have presented challenges to existing models of interstellar object behavior, with ‘Oumuamua exhibiting unusual acceleration and Borisov showing familiar cometary traits.</p>

<p>The recent observations by Dobsonian Power add further intrigue to the profile of 3I/ATLAS and may provide valuable data for professional astronomers when compared with institutional findings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Professional astronomers will likely compare the observations made by Dobsonian Power with archived institutional data to validate or contextualize the findings. The ongoing government shutdown may continue to affect the dissemination of information from agencies like NASA.</p>
