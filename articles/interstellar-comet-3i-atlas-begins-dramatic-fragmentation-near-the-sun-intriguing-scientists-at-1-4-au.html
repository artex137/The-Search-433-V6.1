      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS begins dramatic fragmentation near the sun, intriguing scientists at 1.4 AU</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of fragmentation as it approaches the sun, currently positioned at 1.4 astronomical units (approximately 210 million kilometers) from Sol, according to NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). The comet has not resulted in any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant for scientists as it provides a rare opportunity to study the behavior of an interstellar object under extreme conditions. Astronomers are monitoring the comet's activity in real time to capture changes in its structure and composition, which may offer insights into the formation of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS identified in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Currently at 1.4 AU from the sun.</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter of less than 1 kilometer.</li>
    <li>Speed of over 60 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted by NASA, ESA, and telescopes in Hawaii and Chile.</li>
    <li>Brightness varies between magnitudes 12 and 14.</li>
    <li>Presence of hydrogen cyanide and nickel vapor confirmed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2025, astronomers reported that comet 3I/ATLAS began to fragment as it approached the sun. This fragmentation is attributed to intense solar heat, which accelerates the sublimation of its icy components. Observations have revealed jets of gas and dust being released from the comet, indicating increasing instability.</p>

<p>Prior to this observation, the comet had been travelling on a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin. The speed of the comet ensures it will not be captured by the sun's gravity, allowing for a unique passage before it returns to interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The ongoing fragmentation of 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity to study the mechanics of interstellar comets under extreme conditions," said a NASA spokesperson. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the few interstellar comets observed since the discovery of 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its chemical composition, including rare organic molecules, provides crucial comparisons with other interstellar objects and expands our understanding of cosmic diversity. Previous observations of interstellar comets have highlighted their unique characteristics, particularly their formation in cold molecular clouds.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion, with expectations of further fragmentation. This ongoing observation will help enhance our understanding of the composition and behavior of interstellar comets.</p>
