      <h2>Mysterious UFO-like red halo hovers over Italian Alps—seen twice in nearly 3 years</h2>

<p>A halo of red light has appeared above Possagno, Italy, captured by nature photographer Valter Binotto at 10:45 local time on November 17, 2025. This phenomenon, which resembles a UFO, has occurred twice at the same location, with a similar sighting recorded in March 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The phenomenon, identified as "emission of light and very low-frequency perturbations due to electromagnetic pulse sources," or ELVEs, is rare and typically occurs during intense thunderstorms. Experts have noted that capturing such an event, which is invisible to the naked eye, requires specialized equipment and favorable conditions. The recent sighting has drawn interest from both the scientific community and UFO enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Photographer: Valter Binotto</li>
    <li>Location: Possagno, Italy</li>
    <li>Date and time of latest sighting: November 17, 2025, at 10:45 local time</li>
    <li>Previous sighting: March 2023</li>
    <li>Estimated halo size: 150 miles across</li>
    <li>Altitude of halo: Approximately 60 miles</li>
    <li>ELVEs discovered by NASA: 1990s</li>
    <li>Duration of phenomenon: Approximately one thousandth of a second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2023, Valter Binotto first captured a halo of red light in Possagno, Italy, following a lightning strike near Vernazza, approximately 185 miles south of the site. On November 17, 2025, Binotto photographed a similar phenomenon above Possagno, resulting from a storm near Ancona, roughly 174 miles southeast of the area.</p>

<p>Both events were characterized by their short-lived nature, lasting only milliseconds, and required specific conditions for photography. Binotto has expressed that he has tried to capture such phenomena for years, achieving success only three times due to the unpredictable dynamics involved.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "It is a very rare phenomenon. Only a few lightning strikes are capable of generating it, and sometimes they occur when conditions are not suitable for photographing them." – Valter Binotto
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "Researchers do not think there is anything out of place about ELVE being captured at the same place twice." – Source not disclosed
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>ELVEs are part of a category of events known as transient luminous events (TLEs), which are generally poorly understood due to their elusive nature. The phenomenon was first identified by NASA in the 1990s, and occurrences are infrequent due to the specific conditions needed for their formation.</p>

<p>These events are often visible from distances of up to 100 miles, but the rarity arises from their brief duration and the particular type of lightning required to produce them. Binotto's successful captures highlight the challenges faced by photographers attempting to document such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers continue to study ELVEs to better understand their formation and characteristics. There are no current investigations or charges related to the phenomenon, as it remains a natural occurrence linked to atmospheric conditions.</p>
