      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Rapidly Brightens Ahead of Perihelion</h2>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS has rapidly brightened as it approaches its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, which occurs on Thursday, October 30. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, is only the third interstellar object ever observed, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's trajectory.</p>

<p>This study, conducted by researchers who posted findings on the preprint server arXiv, highlights the importance of monitoring interstellar objects and their characteristics as they traverse our solar system. The European Space Agency (ESA) has mobilized ground-based telescopes in Hawaii, Chile, and Australia to track the comet's progress, while space telescopes like the Hubble and James Webb have also joined the observation efforts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at speeds over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>It will reach perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to brighten to magnitude 9 at perihelion.</li>
    <li>It has a maximum width of about 3.5 miles (5.6 km).</li>
    <li>It will be hidden behind the Sun during its closest approach to Earth.</li>
    <li>Visibility from Earth is expected to resume in early December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. It has been traveling through the solar system at high speeds, reaching perihelion on October 30, 2025. On October 28, researchers reported the comet's rapid brightening ahead of this event.</p>
<p>Ground-based telescopes and space instruments began monitoring the comet's progression as it moved behind the Sun. The ESA noted that it would be obscured during its closest approach to Earth but will reappear in late November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This breathtaking sprint is evidence that the comet has been drifting through interstellar space for many billions of years... The longer 3I/ATLAS was out in space, the higher its speed grew,” said NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its high velocity and trajectory, which is flatter and straighter than typical solar system objects. It is believed to be the oldest comet ever observed, potentially around 3 billion years older than our solar system.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also drawn significant scientific interest, prompting discussions about the origins and compositions of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its perihelion, Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to become visible to Earth-based telescopes in early December 2025. It may also be observed by spacecraft orbiting Jupiter during a close approach in March 2026.</p>
