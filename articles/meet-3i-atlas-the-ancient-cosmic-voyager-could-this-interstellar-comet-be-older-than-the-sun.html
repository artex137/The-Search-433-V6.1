      <h2>Meet 3I-ATLAS, The Ancient Cosmic Voyager: Could This Interstellar Comet Be Older Than The Sun?</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered a faint object, named 3I/ATLAS, speeding through the outer Solar System in mid-2025. Initial observations indicate that this comet could be billions of years older than Earth and possibly even older than the Sun itself. Researchers are racing to study 3I/ATLAS, which offers a rare opportunity to examine material from the galaxy's early days before it disappears back into interstellar space.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it challenges existing knowledge of cosmic history. Scientists are eager to understand its origins and unique properties. The comet's brief visit has generated public interest and debate regarding its unusual features, prompting some experts to call for further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered by:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) observatory in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> Late October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated age:</strong> Between 8 and 14 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 58 kilometres per second</li>
    <li><strong>Expected exit from Solar System:</strong> March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS observatory in Chile. Astronomers quickly recognized its unusual speed and trajectory, confirming it entered the Solar System from interstellar space. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun in late October 2025 and passed closest to Earth in December 2025. It is expected to exit the Solar System after a gravitational interaction in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study ancient material created around long-dead stars,” said Michele Bannister, an associate professor at the University of Canterbury.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unique characteristics have drawn attention, particularly its high speed and rare chemical composition, which differ from comets formed in our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers have a limited timeframe to analyze 3I/ATLAS before it returns to interstellar space. They will focus on its structure, chemistry, and behavior during its remaining time in the Solar System.</p>
