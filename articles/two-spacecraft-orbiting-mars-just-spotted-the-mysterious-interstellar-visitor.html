      <h2>Two Spacecraft Orbiting Mars Just Spotted the Mysterious Interstellar Visitor</h2>

<p>On October 3, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced that two of its spacecraft, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express, have captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed more than 18 million miles from Mars. This marked the closest approach of the comet to the Red Planet.</p>

<p>The observation is significant as it highlights the capabilities of Mars orbiters to monitor unexpected celestial events. Authorities have confirmed that the images will provide valuable data for further analysis of 3I/ATLAS, which is believed to be over seven billion years old and exhibits unusual chemical properties compared to solar system comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: October 3</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: over 18 million miles</li>
    <li>Spacecraft involved: ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, Mars Express</li>
    <li>Camera used: CaSSIS (Color and Stereo Surface Imaging System)</li>
    <li>Estimated age of 3I/ATLAS: over seven billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, the TGO and Mars Express successfully captured images of 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach to Mars. The TGO used a five-second exposure to capture clear images of the comet’s coma, while Mars Express utilized a shorter half-second exposure.</p>

<p>Prior to this event, speculation arose that NASA's Perseverance rover might have detected 3I/ATLAS, but experts have since suggested that the image in question likely depicted Phobos, one of Mars' moons.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one,” said Colin Wilson, ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars project scientist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” said Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the CaSSIS camera.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. Its unique chemical composition, including a high ratio of carbon dioxide to water, contrasts with typical solar system comets. The comet's age and origin suggest it was ejected from a star system near the Milky Way's center.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ESA plans to gather more observations of 3I/ATLAS using its Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) as the comet approaches the Sun, where it will exhibit increased activity.</p>
