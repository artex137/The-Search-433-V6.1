      <h2>Destroy All Humans! Has Become a Cult Classic Since Its Release</h2>

<p>Destroy All Humans! (DAH!), a video game developed by Pandemic Studios' Australian team, was released in the summer of 2005 for PS2 and Xbox. The game allows players to take on the role of an alien named Cryptosporidium-137, who is on a mission to conquer Earth. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the game.</p>

<p>This game has gained significant attention over the years for its unique premise, allowing players to embody the villain rather than the hero. Authorities in the gaming industry have acknowledged its impact, noting that it has inspired a resurgence of interest in games that feature offbeat humor and unconventional storylines.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Release date: Summer 2005</li>
    <li>Developed by: Pandemic Studios' Australian team</li>
    <li>Main character: Cryptosporidium-137, an alien soldier</li>
    <li>Game platforms: PS2, Xbox</li>
    <li>Number of missions: 22 across six fictional locations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2002, Pandemic Studios' Australian team developed Army Men: RTS, a solid yet uninspiring game. After their project, Oddballs, was shelved by Microsoft, the team brainstormed for new ideas.</p>
<p>By 2005, they had developed the concept for DAH!, flipping the game’s focus from 80% UFO gameplay to 80% on-foot exploration. This shift helped shape the game's identity.</p>
<p>The game was released in the summer of 2005, quickly gaining popularity for its humor and unique gameplay.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It was significant because of the angle on it,” says animator Lachlan Creagh.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Instead of being 80% UFO and 20% on foot, we basically flipped it. That turned it into the game that it is,” explains designer Dan Teasdale.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the release of DAH!, the gaming landscape was dominated by darker, grittier titles, such as Grand Theft Auto. DAH! stood out for its comedic approach and playful satire, reflecting a cultural shift in video game narratives.</p>
<p>The game has since inspired sequels and remakes, reinforcing its status as a cult classic and influencing other titles that embrace humor and unconventional storytelling.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future developments for the Destroy All Humans! franchise have not been disclosed, but the game's continued popularity suggests potential for further exploration of its themes and characters in upcoming projects.</p>
