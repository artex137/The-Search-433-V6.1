      <h2>Comet sparks scientific fascination, online furor over 'alien' origins</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently travelling through the solar system, generating excitement among scientists and internet users, including a request for information from Kim Kardashian to NASA. The comet, which was detected in July, has raised questions about its origins, with some speculating it could be an alien spacecraft, though NASA has dismissed these claims.</p>

<p>This matter has significant implications for scientific inquiry and public understanding of astronomy. NASA has released new images of the comet to counter the speculation, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based science over conjecture.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA released new images of the comet on November 20, 2025.</li>
    <li>Thomas Puzia leads the team at a Chilean observatory that discovered the comet.</li>
    <li>Speculation about the comet's origins has included claims of it being an alien spacecraft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected, sparking interest among scientists and the public. As speculation about its origins grew, particularly regarding the possibility of it being an alien spacecraft, NASA released new images on November 20, 2025, to clarify its nature. Thomas Puzia, an astrophysicist from the Chilean observatory, has emphasized that the comet is a normal object from interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It's amazing to see how people are really engaged in the discussion,” said Thomas Puzia, leader of the discovery team. “But it's very dangerous and to a certain degree misleading to put speculations ahead of scientific process.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever detected. The public's fascination with extraterrestrial life has led to various theories about the comet's origins. NASA's efforts to provide clarity reflect ongoing challenges in communicating scientific findings amidst widespread speculation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS and provide updates based on scientific observations, while researchers will focus on gathering more data to better understand its characteristics and trajectory.</p>
