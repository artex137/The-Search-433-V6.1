      <h2>Radio Signal Confirms Comet 3I/Atlas’s Nature, Ending Scientific Debate</h2>

<p>New findings have confirmed comet 3I/Atlas as a natural celestial object, ending weeks of speculation and conspiracy theories. The confirmation came from observations at the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa on October 24, 2023.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it validates the comet's nature through the detection of radio signals, which align with typical comet activity. The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, which manages the MeerKAT telescope, is now planning further observations as the comet approaches Earth in December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of Detection: October 24, 2023</li>
    <li>Telescope Used: MeerKAT</li>
    <li>Frequencies Detected: 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz</li>
    <li>Next close approach to Earth: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Next critical point near Jupiter: March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 20 and 28, 2023, previous attempts to detect signals from comet 3I/Atlas using the MeerKAT telescope were unsuccessful. However, on October 24, the telescope successfully detected radio absorption lines from the comet, confirming its nature.</p>
<p>The observed radio lines correspond to hydroxyl radicals (OH), which are expected during typical comet activity as ice sublimates when comets approach the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist, remarked on the significance of these findings, stating, “Despite the confirmation of the OH absorption signal, I maintain a keen interest in explorations that might reveal additional details about 3I/Atlas.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of hydroxyl radicals adds to the understanding of cometary behavior, providing insights into the changes that occur as comets approach the sun. Increased public interest in astrophysics has emerged from the ongoing discussions surrounding comet 3I/Atlas.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astrophysicists will continue to monitor comet 3I/Atlas as it nears Earth and approaches its next critical point near Jupiter in March 2026. Future observations are planned to further explore the production of hydroxyl radicals and other characteristics of the comet.</p>
