      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shock: Putin Claims Interstellar Comet Is 'Russia's Secret Weapon' in Wild Joke</h2>

<p>Vladimir Putin has joked that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is Russia's "secret weapon" during a press conference in Moscow on December 19, 2025. The comet, first discovered on July 1, 2025, has sparked widespread interest and speculation, particularly regarding its origins and potential implications for Earth. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This remark comes amid increasing curiosity about 3I/ATLAS, which has entered the solar system, drawing attention from both astronomers and conspiracy theorists alike. Experts have been monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics, as it approaches its closest point to Earth on December 18, 2025, at a distance of approximately 210 million km.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet measures between 100 and 200 meters wide and travels at over 50 km/s.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 18, 2025, at 1.4 AU (about 210 million km).</li>
    <li>Putin's comment occurred during an annual press conference attended by more than 1,300 journalists.</li>
    <li>Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, has stated there is no evidence of alien involvement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, during the ATLAS survey. It passed close to Jupiter and has been closely monitored since its discovery. On December 15, 2025, Sean Duffy confirmed that the comet is natural and icy, dismissing any alien theories. Putin made his remark about the comet during his press conference on December 19, 2025. The comet is expected to reach its perihelion on December 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I will let you in on something, but it must stay between us because it's classified information. This is our secret weapon, but we will only use it as a last resort,” said Putin, prompting laughter from attendees.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It's a comet, and it doesn't pose a threat to Earth,” he added, addressing concerns during rising geopolitical tensions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“At this point, given all the data that we have, I would agree that it's most likely natural, but there are still a lot of things we don't understand about it,” said Putin regarding the comet's characteristics.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet’s unique properties and trajectory have spurred both scientific inquiry and public fascination. Notably, scientists have been puzzled by its unusual emissions and polarimetric data, which deviate from typical comet behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion and prepare for further observations to understand its characteristics better. The comet's behavior may provide insights into its origins and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
