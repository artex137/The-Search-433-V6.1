      <h2>The mysterious anti-tail of 3I/Atlas baffles astronomers — new study reveals complex jet-like structures</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered unusual features in the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, including a strong anti-tail and multiple jet-like streams of gas and dust. The findings were detailed in a study by Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, who noted that the comet displays a level of complexity that exceeds previous expectations.</p>

<p>This study is significant for understanding the behaviour of interstellar comets. 3I/Atlas, which is not bound by the Sun's gravity and is passing through our Solar System, provides a rare opportunity for scientists to learn about celestial objects from other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is an interstellar object, having originated from outside our Solar System.</li>
    <li>This is only the third observed interstellar comet, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a Harvard scientist leading the study of this comet.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas has shown unusual changes in brightness and colour over recent months.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently passing through the Solar System and will continue its journey into deep space.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first observed as it entered the Solar System. Since then, astronomers have monitored its behaviour closely, noting changes in brightness and colour. Recent studies have revealed the presence of an anti-tail and multiple jets of gas and dust, which have intrigued scientists and prompted further investigation into the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The jets look like large structures, showing that the comet is releasing material in a very organised way — not randomly, as most comets do."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas adds to the growing knowledge about interstellar comets. Unlike typical comets that originate from the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud within our Solar System, 3I/Atlas provides insights into the composition and behaviour of celestial objects formed in different environments. This research is crucial for understanding the formation of planets and stars across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/Atlas until it fades from view, studying its shape, colour, and brightness to gather information about its surface and interaction with sunlight. The ongoing research may further illuminate the behaviours of dust and gas in space, enhancing our understanding of interstellar phenomena.</p>
