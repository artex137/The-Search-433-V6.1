      <h2>NASA’s TESS Tracks Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS in Its Final Act</h2>

<p>NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has tracked interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it departs the solar system, marking a significant moment in astronomical observation. The comet, detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey system in Chile, has been observed by various space telescopes and missions since its discovery.</p>

<p>This observation is critical because 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Astronomers have mobilized a global campaign to study the comet, which provides a unique opportunity to analyze materials from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's TESS tracked the comet from January 15 to January 22, 2026.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>Comet passed close to Mars in October 2025.</li>
    <li>TESS provided continuous coverage for several days during its tracking.</li>
    <li>Observations included contributions from multiple space telescopes, including Hubble and James Webb.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected comet 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS survey system in Chile. Initial observations confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin. In October 2025, the comet passed close to Mars, allowing Mars-orbiting spacecraft to capture unique images.</p>

<p>In January 2026, TESS paused its regular exoplanet survey to track 3I/ATLAS from January 15 to 22. This tracking provided valuable data on the comet's brightness and activity as it receded from the Sun. The observations were later analyzed and archived for further research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The tracking of 3I/ATLAS is a rare opportunity to study a comet from another stellar environment,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following the detection of ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such comets helps scientists understand the formation and composition of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data collected from TESS and other observatories will be analyzed by researchers worldwide to further understand the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. The results may provide insights into the conditions of material formed around distant stars.</p>
