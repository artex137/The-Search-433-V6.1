      <h2>Spacecraft study shows interstellar comet encounter mission within reach</h2>

<p>A study by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has indicated that a mission to intercept interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is feasible. The findings were published recently, following the comet's arrival this year. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The study highlights the potential for future space missions to explore interstellar objects, which could provide insights into planetary formation beyond the solar system. The Vera Rubin Observatory is expected to detect more such objects in the coming decade, according to Dr. Alan Stern, SwRI Associate Vice President and project lead.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS arrived in 2023.</li>
    <li>SwRI conducted the study to evaluate mission feasibility.</li>
    <li>Dr. Alan Stern led the project.</li>
    <li>Matthew Freeman served as project manager.</li>
    <li>Specialized software was developed to assess optimal trajectories.</li>
    <li>Dr. Mark Tapley is an orbital mechanics expert involved in the study.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, the first known interstellar comet, 1I/'Oumuamua, was discovered. This was followed by the detection of 2I/Borisov in 2019. The arrival of 3I/ATLAS in 2023 reinforced predictions about the detection of more interstellar objects in the future. The SwRI study, which has evaluated the feasibility of a mission to intercept 3I/ATLAS, has recently been completed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These new kinds of objects offer humankind the first feasible opportunity to closely explore bodies formed in other star systems,” said Dr. Alan Stern.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The very encouraging thing about the appearance of 3I/ATLAS is that it further strengthens the case that our study for an ISC mission made,” said Dr. Mark Tapley.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar comets has opened new avenues for space exploration. Prior to 3I/ATLAS, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov were the only known interstellar comets. The ongoing advancements in observational technology, such as the Vera Rubin Observatory, are expected to enhance the detection of similar objects in the future.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>SwRI plans to further develop mission concepts based on the findings of the study. The team aims to gather more data on interstellar comets and establish optimal strategies for future missions.</p>
