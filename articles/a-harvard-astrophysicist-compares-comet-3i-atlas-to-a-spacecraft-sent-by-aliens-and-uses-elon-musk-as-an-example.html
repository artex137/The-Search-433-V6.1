      <h2>A Harvard Astrophysicist Compares Comet 3I/ATLAS to a Spacecraft Sent by Aliens and Uses Elon Musk as an Example</h2>

<p>Days before the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on December 19, 2025, scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have expressed differing views on its origin. Loeb posits that if the comet were artificial, it could be linked to an advanced civilization, drawing parallels to the actions of space entrepreneurs like Elon Musk. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This debate over the comet's nature highlights the importance of understanding potential extraterrestrial technologies. NASA continues to classify 3I/ATLAS as a comet, while Loeb argues for the need to consider the possibility of advanced civilizations having previously existed in our galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Notable figure:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li><strong>Agency position:</strong> NASA asserts it is a comet</li>
    <li><strong>Loeb's hypothesis:</strong> Possible artificial origin</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has voiced his thoughts on the comet's potential artificial nature in various interviews, most recently in an interview with the New York Post. He has highlighted the unusual trajectory and composition of 3I/ATLAS as points of interest. His arguments suggest that humanity's ability to launch technological objects into space implies that other civilizations could do the same.</p>

<p>In January, a case arose when an “asteroid” discovered turned out to be a Tesla car sent into space by Elon Musk as a promotional act. This incident has contributed to Loeb's perspective on the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If 3I/ATLAS is technological, it could represent a threat to humanity,” Avi Loeb stated in his discussions about the comet.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Most of the real estate is out there in the Milky Way and not on the rock we all occupy,” he added, emphasizing the need for a planetary defense network.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's remarks reflect a broader discourse on humanity's place in the cosmos and the potential for contact with alien civilizations. The idea of extraterrestrial life has gained traction, with many scientists advocating for increased surveillance and preparedness in space exploration.</p>

<p>Loeb's mention of a “Darwinian selection” among civilizations raises concerns regarding the implications of advanced technologies and their potential risks to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the date of the closest approach to Earth nears, scientists will focus on observing 3I/ATLAS. Loeb advocates for enhanced space monitoring and the establishment of a defense network to address any potential threats from technological objects in space.</p>
