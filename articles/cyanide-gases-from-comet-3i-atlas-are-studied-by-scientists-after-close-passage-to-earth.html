      <h2>Cyanide gases from comet 3I/ATLAS are studied by scientists after close passage to Earth</h2>

<p>The scientific community has begun analyzing data from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which made its closest approach to Earth in December 2025. The comet, originating outside the Solar System, released gases including cyanide during its passage, which occurred at a safe distance of approximately 269 million kilometers from Earth, according to reports from NASA and other observatories.</p>

<p>This study of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it offers insights into the chemical composition of celestial bodies from other stellar systems. Authorities have mobilized large space and ground-based observatories to observe the comet's mass loss and the gases released, enhancing understanding of the origins of such interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 by the ATLAS asteroid warning system in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, in October 2025, at a distance of about 210 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>It made its closest approach to Earth in December 2025, at a distance of 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Scientists have estimated that hundreds of kilograms of gas and dust were released every second from the comet.</li>
    <li>The study of 3I/ATLAS includes high-precision measurements from the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>The presence of cyanide and hydrogen cyanide was detected in the comet’s gaseous plume, known as its coma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers identified comet 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS asteroid warning system in Chile. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its extrasolar origin. In October 2025, it reached perihelion at about 210 million kilometers from the Sun. By December 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, remaining at a safe distance of 269 million kilometers.</p>

<p>Following its passage, scientists have conducted spectroscopic analyses to study the gases emitted by the comet, including cyanide and hydrogen cyanide, which are common in comets from the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS provides a unique opportunity to study pristine material from another star system,” said Avi Loeb, a leading astronomer involved in the research. “Understanding its chemical composition is vital for comparative planetary science.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the Solar System. Previous visitors include 1I/’Oumuamua, which lacked visible cometary activity, and 2I/Borisov, which displayed typical comet features. The study of 3I/ATLAS helps scientists contextualize its behavior within the framework of these earlier objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are exploring ways to analyze remnants left by 3I/ATLAS, including the potential collection of millimeter-sized dust particles that could cross Earth’s orbit. This data will inform future rapid interception missions for upcoming interstellar visitors.</p>
