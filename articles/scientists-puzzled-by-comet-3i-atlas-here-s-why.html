      <h2>Scientists puzzled by Comet 3I/ATLAS: Here’s why</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025, revealing unusual water production, according to observations by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). The comet, identified on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), is the third confirmed object from outside the Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it provides insights into the composition and activity of interstellar objects. Scientists have noted the comet's rich water content and active surface, which may offer clues about the formation of distant planetary systems. Research teams have been working continuously to study this celestial visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>First identified on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Entry speed exceeded 30 km/s.</li>
    <li>Measuring water release peaked at 3.17 × 10²⁹ molecules per second on November 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>Surface ices warmed, leading to a visible coma and two tails.</li>
    <li>About 20% of its ice actively sublimated, compared to 3–5% in typical Solar System comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers identified comet 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS system. Following this, teams at NASA and ESA began monitoring the comet's trajectory and activity. The comet passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025, causing surface ices to warm and produce significant water emissions. On November 6, 2025, the SWAN instrument recorded peak water release, marking a key moment in its observation.</p>

<p>As the comet receded from the Sun, water production decreased to approximately 10-20 trillion molecules per second by early December 2025. Researchers utilized data from the Hubble Space Telescope and Gemini North to document the comet's features.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS provides a rarely opened window into how distant planetary systems might have formed,” a lead researcher from the ESA stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Its active surface and rich water content set it apart from other interstellar objects,” noted a scientist at NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov as the third confirmed interstellar object. Previous studies of these objects have provided insights into their origins and compositions, but 3I/ATLAS stands out due to its significant water production and active surface characteristics.</p>

<p>This comet's findings may influence future research on interstellar objects and their role in the solar system's history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers expect that post-perihelion data will enhance models regarding interstellar object formation and the preservation of ices. Ongoing studies will focus on analyzing the comet's emissions and surface activity as it continues its journey across the galaxy.</p>
