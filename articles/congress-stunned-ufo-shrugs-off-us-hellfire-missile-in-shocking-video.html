      <h2>Congress Stunned: UFO Shrugs Off US Hellfire Missile in Shocking Video</h2>

<p>A video presented in the US Congress has shown a Hellfire missile appearing to bounce off a UFO, leaving lawmakers stunned during a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on Wednesday. The footage captured a US MQ-9 Reaper drone firing at a glowing orb-like Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) off the coast of Yemen. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident raises significant questions about US military capabilities against unidentified aerial phenomena. Lawmakers have called for greater transparency regarding UAP encounters and the technology required to address them, following the unexpected outcome of the missile strike.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of the hearing: Wednesday, not disclosed</li>
    <li>Location: US Congress, House Oversight subcommittee</li>
    <li>Type of missile: AGM-114 Hellfire</li>
    <li>Drone used: US MQ-9 Reaper</li>
    <li>Incident location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Witnesses included US Air Force and Navy veterans</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The hearing commenced with Representative <strong>Eric Burlison</strong> introducing the video footage of the missile strike on the UAP. The video displayed radar and infrared imagery of the Reaper drone launching the Hellfire missile.</p>
<p>As the missile struck the object, it ricocheted away without causing any damage. This prompted gasps from attendees and demands for further information regarding the nature of the UAP.</p>
<p>Several witnesses testified about their experiences with UAPs, highlighting concerns over military preparedness against such phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No known military technology could withstand a direct hit from a Hellfire missile,” a US Air Force veteran testified.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Journalist <strong>George Knapp</strong> stated, “An archive of similar UAP encounters exists on government servers but has been withheld from both Congress and the public.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The hearing revisited prior UAP sightings, including a glowing square-shaped craft over Vandenberg Air Force Base in 2003 and a triangular object spotted at Langley Air Force Base in 2012. Witnesses noted a consistent pattern of UAP appearances over sensitive military installations.</p>
<p>These incidents have raised concerns about public trust and national security, as officials have warned that withholding information undermines both.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue discussions on UAP transparency and military preparedness. Investigations into the incident will likely involve the Department of Defense's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to assess the implications of the footage.</p>
