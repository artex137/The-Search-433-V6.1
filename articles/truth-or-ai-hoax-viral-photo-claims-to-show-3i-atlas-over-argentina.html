      <h2>Truth or AI Hoax? Viral Photo Claims to Show 3I/ATLAS Over Argentina</h2>

<p>A viral photo claiming to show interstellar object 3I/ATLAS glowing above Córdoba, Argentina, has sparked a global frenzy since it was posted on 26 October 2025. The image, shared by the account @Atlas__CTO, allegedly depicts a streak of light in the southern sky at 2:43 a.m. However, space experts have warned that the photo is likely AI-generated, raising concerns about misinformation in astrophotography.</p>

<p>The incident highlights the growing issue of false information in scientific imagery. Authorities and experts are urging the public to verify such claims against reputable sources before sharing. The viral post has led to discussions about the reliability of astronomical images in the digital age.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Photo posted on 26 October 2025 by @Atlas__CTO.</li>
    <li>Alleged sighting occurred at 2:43 a.m. over Córdoba, Argentina.</li>
    <li>Hashtags #3IATLAS, #AlienSignal, and #ArgentinaSighting trended worldwide.</li>
    <li>Experts confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is too faint to be seen without professional telescopes.</li>
    <li>No observatory reported any matching event related to the viral image.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 26 October 2025, the account @Atlas__CTO posted the viral photo claiming to show 3I/ATLAS in the night sky over Córdoba. Within hours, the photo gained traction online, leading to widespread discussion and trending hashtags. Experts soon began to debunk the image, citing discrepancies in star patterns and the user's history of sharing AI-generated content. By the end of the day, several organizations, including the European Southern Observatory (ESO), confirmed that no matching astronomical event had been reported.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks impressive, but it's a composite. The stars don't align with any known southern-sky field,” said Lucía Romero, an astrophotography expert.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If it looks spectacular enough to be science fiction, it probably is,” cautioned NASA regarding the viral image.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a larger trend of misinformation in science, particularly regarding astronomical discoveries. The rise of generative-image tools has made it easier for false representations to circulate. Prior incidents have raised awareness about the need for critical evaluation of scientific images.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts recommend that audiences verify astronomical images by checking observatory databases and official agency feeds. Ongoing discussions about the implications of AI-generated content in science are anticipated as technology continues to evolve.</p>
