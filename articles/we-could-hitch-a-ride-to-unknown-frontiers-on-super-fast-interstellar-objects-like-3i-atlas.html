      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Makes Closest Approach to Earth</h2>
<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, coming within 267 million kilometres. Scientists have monitored the object, believed to be a natural comet, as it continues its highly eccentric trajectory. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object directly observed in the solar system, has sparked interest in the potential for future exploration beyond our solar system. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has proposed that such objects could facilitate human travel to interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 267 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Speed of 3I/ATLAS:</strong> 37 miles per second (approximately 60 kilometres per second)</li>
    <li><strong>Next closest approach:</strong> 33.3 million miles (approximately 53.6 million kilometres) of Jupiter on March 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Number of observed interstellar objects:</strong> Three</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in 2022. Following its detection, scientists have tracked its trajectory and speed as it approached Earth. The closest approach occurred on December 19, 2023, and it is expected to pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The discovery of interstellar objects over the past decade offers new opportunities for humanity to send time capsules to interstellar space,” said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I would have loved to hitchhike 3I/ATLAS and let it carry my remains into interstellar space, if offered the opportunity,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects has increased in the last decade, opening discussions about the potential for sending messages or technological objects into deep space. Previous missions, such as the Voyager spacecraft, have provided insights into the outer solar system but are limited in their reach.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter in 2026, scientists plan to utilize spacecraft positioned there for closer observation. Future proposals include using high-power lasers to engrave messages or designing missions to attach objects to interstellar comets.</p>
