      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS remains active almost three weeks after perihelion</h2>

<p>Astrophotographer Efrain Morales has captured an image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, on November 17, 2025. The image shows an asymmetrical coma and an elongated tail, indicating the comet's ongoing activity nearly three weeks after its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it confirms that 3I/ATLAS continues to release gas and dust during its solar separation. Experts are monitoring the comet to analyze its composition and behavior, as it is the third interstellar object confirmed in the Solar System and follows a hyperbolic trajectory at approximately 221,000 km/h.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: November 17, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Aguadilla, Puerto Rico</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during capture: 190 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Core diameter: Estimated between 5 and 11 km</li>
    <li>Brightness: Remains at magnitude 7 to 8</li>
    <li>Next minimum approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 269 million kilometers</li>
    <li>No risk of collision reported</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2025, records from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter probe revealed a halo of gas around the nucleus during a close pass to Mars. The comet continued to eject jets following its perihelion on October 29. On November 3, images from the Gemini Sul observatory in Chile showed a coma exceeding 56,000 kilometers. The Projeto Telescópio Virtual recorded 3I/ATLAS on November 11 with a narrow ion tail. The latest image by Efrain Morales on November 17 confirmed the comet's sustained activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The asymmetrical coma suggests an irregular ejection of material, which differs from the behavior recorded in 2I/Borisov,” said a spokesperson for the monitoring specialists.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed in the Solar System, following 2I/Borisov, which was detected in 2019. Observations of interstellar comets provide valuable insights into the composition and behavior of such objects originating from the Oort Cloud. Ongoing studies of 3I/ATLAS's composition indicate a significant presence of carbon dioxide and water.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its minimum distance from Earth on December 19. Observations will focus on its evolving geometry and ongoing activity as it moves away from the Sun.</p>
