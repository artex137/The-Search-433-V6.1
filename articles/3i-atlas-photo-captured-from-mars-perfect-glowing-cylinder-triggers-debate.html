      <h2>3I/Atlas photo captured from Mars: 'Perfect glowing cylinder' triggers debate</h2>

<p>A photograph of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, taken by NASA’s Perseverance rover on the Martian surface, has sparked debate online after it captured a glowing cylindrical object moving across the sky. The image was taken on October 3, when 3I/Atlas flew by Mars, but no other images of the comet have been reported from orbiters.</p>

<p>This photograph has reignited discussions about the nature of 3I/Atlas, with some speculating that it could be an alien spacecraft. The scientific community is examining the image closely, as it features a bright object that deviates from typical comet appearances. Authorities continue to analyze the data to provide clarity on the comet's characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Photo taken by NASA’s Perseverance rover on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas was approximately 38 million kilometres from Mars at the time of the photo.</li>
    <li>The object’s estimated size is about 46 kilometres in diameter and it has a mass of 33 billion tonnes.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas travels at a speed of 60,000 km/sec (220,000 km/hour).</li>
    <li>Photo taken using the Navcam, with a spatial scale of about 12,500 kilometres.</li>
    <li>The elongated appearance of the object is attributed to a long integration time during image capture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first discovered on July 1, 2023. Since then, it has garnered significant attention due to its unusual characteristics. The comet approached Mars on October 3, prompting the Perseverance rover to capture its image. As scientists analyze the photograph, they are working to determine the object's true nature and whether it conforms to known physical laws.</p>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The stripe is about 50,000 kilometres long," and explained that the elongated appearance of the object is due to the integration time used to make the composite Navcam image.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas has raised questions within the scientific community regarding interstellar objects. Its trajectory indicates it is traveling from outside our solar system, and its size and speed have led to various hypotheses about its origin and nature. Previous interstellar objects have also prompted similar discussions but none have displayed the same level of intrigue as 3I/Atlas.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the image and data collected from 3I/Atlas, aiming to clarify its characteristics and address the ongoing speculation surrounding its appearance. Further observations may be conducted as additional data becomes available.</p>
