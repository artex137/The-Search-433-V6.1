      <h2>Mystery Deepens Over Interstellar Visitor 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS observatory in Chile, is raising questions among astronomers due to its unusual characteristics. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this celestial body.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Researchers at the European Southern Observatory have noted that its trajectory and unique features could provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects. Currently, 3I/ATLAS is behind the Sun from Earth's viewpoint, making it temporarily invisible to ground-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 2025 by ATLAS Observatory, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Interstellar object (third known)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Sun:</strong> Late October 2025 (~1.4 AU)</li>
    <li><strong>Current position:</strong> Behind the Sun (not visible from Earth)</li>
    <li><strong>Unusual features:</strong> Travels along the plane of the planets; double tail; strong CO₂ outgassing</li>
    <li><strong>Size estimate:</strong> Up to 11 km (7 mi) wide</li>
    <li><strong>Artificial origin:</strong> Unproven, but not ruled out</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by astronomers at the ATLAS observatory in Chile. Since its discovery, it has been noted for its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not bound by the Sun’s gravity. In late October 2025, the object will reach its closest point to the Sun, around 1.4 astronomical units away.</p>

<p>Currently, 3I/ATLAS is obscured by the Sun from Earth's perspective. It is expected to re-emerge into the morning sky in late October, coinciding with its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re witnessing something extraordinary,” said Dr Brian Cox, a professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester. “Whether it’s just a comet or something far more remarkable, it reminds us that the universe is still full of surprises.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr Cox also noted the alignment of 3I/ATLAS with the planetary plane, stating, “If you were sending a probe into our Solar System, that’s exactly the route you’d take to study the planets efficiently.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered the Solar System. Its discovery follows the earlier observations of Oumuamua and Borisov, both of which sparked discussions about the nature of interstellar objects and the possibility of artificial origins.</p>

<p>Speculation regarding the nature of such interstellar objects has been prevalent since the discovery of Oumuamua, with some scientists urging caution while exploring unconventional explanations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Once 3I/ATLAS re-emerges from behind the Sun, astronomers plan to resume observations using both Earth-based observatories and space telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. These observations may provide crucial data on the object's size, shape, and rotation, as well as insights into its potential origins.</p>
