      <h2>Comet C/2025 A6 Lemmon becomes visible to naked eye</h2>
<p>Sky watchers in the Northern Hemisphere can now look for Comet C/2025 A6 Lemmon, which has brightened enough to be visible without a telescope. The comet will be most easily seen about 90 minutes before dawn and may also be visible during post-sunset dark skies starting Thursday.</p>

<p>This visibility is significant as it marks the first time in five years that a bright comet has been observable in the Northern Hemisphere, drawing attention from both amateur and professional astronomers. NASA explains that comets like Lemmon are remnants from the formation of the solar system and develop distinct features as they approach the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 A6 Lemmon was discovered in January 2025.</li>
    <li>It is expected to be visible without a telescope starting Thursday.</li>
    <li>Optimal viewing times are approximately 90 minutes before dawn and after sunset.</li>
    <li>Sky conditions should be clear or partly cloudy for best visibility.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is also currently visible but only through telescopes or binoculars.</li>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) is brightening but remains difficult to observe due to its low altitude.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 A6 Lemmon was discovered in January 2025. In the following months, it has become increasingly bright, making it visible through telescopes and binoculars. As of this week, it is set to be visible to the naked eye during optimal viewing conditions.</p>

<p>NASA has described the characteristics of comets, noting their icy nuclei and the development of comas and tails as they approach the Sun. Sky watchers are encouraged to utilize star charts to locate the comet effectively.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Each comet has a frozen part, called a nucleus, often a few miles across. The nucleus contains icy chunks, frozen gases with bits of embedded dust,” NASA explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Five years have passed since the Northern Hemisphere last saw a bright comet, specifically Comet NEOWISE. The appearance of Comet Lemmon reignites interest in comet observation among the public and the astronomy community.</p>

<p>Additionally, Comet 3I/ATLAS, only the third interstellar comet ever observed, and Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) are also gaining attention, although their visibility is more limited compared to Lemmon.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers are advised to check local weather conditions and prepare for comet viewing over the coming weeks, as Comet Lemmon is expected to get brighter. Ongoing updates about visibility and sky conditions will be available through astronomy blogs and star chart websites.</p>
