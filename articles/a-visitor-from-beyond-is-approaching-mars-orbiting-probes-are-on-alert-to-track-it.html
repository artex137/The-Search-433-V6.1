      <h2>A visitor from beyond is approaching Mars: orbiting probes are on alert to track it</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, is approaching Mars, with its closest approach occurring on October 3, 2025. The comet, which was first identified in July, is traveling at an estimated speed of 220,000 km/h and is currently about 30 million kilometers from the red planet. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This passage of 3I/ATLAS presents a significant opportunity for scientists. The European Space Agency (ESA) has deployed two probes, Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, to monitor the comet closely. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers are also prepared to gather data during this event, which could yield valuable insights into the composition and origin of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at a speed of 220,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>It is currently about 30 million kilometers from Mars.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars occurred on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>ESA probes Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter have been observing since October 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and rovers are also monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>Additional observation opportunities will arise through October 7, 2023.</li>
    <li>The Juice mission will observe the comet again in November 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers first identified Comet 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Observations from ground-based telescopes provided initial data about the comet's speed and trajectory. By October 1, 2023, ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter began tracking the comet as it approached Mars. The closest approach occurred on October 3, 2025, with additional observation opportunities available until October 7, 2023. Future observations will take place during the Juice mission in November 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar comet as it moves through our solar system,” said a spokesperson for NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, highlighting its significance for scientific research. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have also drawn considerable attention from astronomers, leading to increased interest in the study of such celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for additional data as the comet passes Mars. The Juice mission in November 2023 will provide another opportunity to observe the comet as it travels further into the solar system.</p>
