      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: A Rare Interstellar Visitor</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, one of only three interstellar objects detected in our solar system, is currently passing through our cosmic neighborhood. It was first confirmed as originating from outside Earth's solar system in July 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</p>

<p>This comet matters because it offers scientists a unique opportunity to study a celestial body from another star system. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are actively monitoring its trajectory and characteristics as it speeds towards the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Confirmed in July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> About 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> 130 million miles on October 30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Currently on the opposite side of the sun from Earth; will reappear in December 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Size Estimate:</strong> Between 1,000 feet and 3.5 miles wide</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Agencies:</strong> NASA, European Space Agency, Minor Planet Center</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers confirmed the existence of Comet 3I/ATLAS, noting its interstellar origin. The Minor Planet Center recorded its observation shortly after. As the comet travels through the solar system, scientists have been working to determine its size and physical characteristics.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2023, the comet will come within 130 million miles of the sun. Currently, it is on the opposite side of the sun from Earth, making it impossible to observe from the ground.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is making a short journey into and out of our solar system, sparking an urgency to get a closer look at this unique object,” according to a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While some have speculated about its origins, we have confirmed that it is almost certainly a comet,” said a representative from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, following Comet Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. The discovery of such objects has prompted interest and speculation about their origins and characteristics, with some researchers exploring the possibility of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet continues its journey, astronomers will use orbiters around Mars and Jupiter to gather additional observations. The comet is expected to become visible again in December 2023, offering further opportunities for study.</p>
