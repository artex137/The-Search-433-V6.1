      <h2>James Webb Telescope discovers 3I/ATLAS is 7 billion years old</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has revealed that comet 3I/ATLAS is potentially 7 billion years old, according to a study published on the preprint server arXiv. The research indicates the comet has undergone significant changes due to cosmic ray bombardment during its extensive journey through the Milky Way. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it enhances our understanding of extraterrestrial objects and their origins. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS is a comet from outside our solar system, marking it as only the third known comet to enter our solar system from elsewhere. The study adds to ongoing debates in the scientific community regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>It has been heavily irradiated by cosmic rays over its lifespan.</li>
    <li>This research is based on observations from the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>The lead author of the study is Romain Maggiolo from the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third known comet to enter our solar system from outside.</li>
    <li>The study's findings have not yet been peer-reviewed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers have studied 3I/ATLAS using the James Webb Space Telescope, revealing its estimated age of 7 billion years. Observations show that the comet has absorbed numerous galactic cosmic rays, leading to significant changes in its physical state. The research combines these observations with computer simulations to support the estimated age.</p>
<p>Previously, 3I/ATLAS was noted for exhibiting extreme levels of carbon dioxide enrichment, prompting further investigation. The study highlights the difference between comets from outside our solar system and those formed within the heliosphere, which protects Earth from cosmic radiation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It's very slow, but over billions of years, it's a very strong effect,” said Romain Maggiolo, the lead author of the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has sparked debate among scientists, with some, including Harvard professor Avi Loeb, suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft due to its unusual characteristics. NASA has consistently maintained that it is a comet, emphasizing its significance as a celestial body from another solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research findings are expected to undergo peer review. Meanwhile, 3I/ATLAS is currently visible from Earth through telescopes as it moves back towards our planet from the sun.</p>
