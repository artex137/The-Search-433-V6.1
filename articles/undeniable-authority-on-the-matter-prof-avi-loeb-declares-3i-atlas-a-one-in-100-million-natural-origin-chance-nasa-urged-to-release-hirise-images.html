      <h2>Undeniable Authority On The Matter, Prof. Avi Loeb Declares 3I/ATLAS a “One-in-100 Million” Natural Origin Chance — NASA Urged to Release HiRISE Images</h2>

<p>CAPE COD, Mass. — Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb has stated that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has a 1 in 100 million chance of being a naturally occurring comet. His remarks come as NASA faces calls to release HiRISE images captured during the object's recent pass near Mars on October 2–3, 2025.</p>

<p>Loeb's calculations suggest that the features of 3I/ATLAS, including its behavior and trajectory, do not align with standard cometary models. As the U.S. government shutdown concludes, he has publicly requested that NASA make the 40-day-old imaging data available for further analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to have a diameter of roughly 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The object passed within approximately 29 million kilometers of Mars on October 2–3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb has identified at least seven distinct jets emanating from 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The HiRISE images were taken at a resolution of 30 kilometers per pixel.</li>
    <li>Loeb's analysis suggests the mass loss of 3I/ATLAS would exceed 16 percent of its total volume without visible fragmentation.</li>
    <li>The object’s orbital path is tilted less than five degrees from Earth’s orbit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2–3, 2025, NASA’s HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS as it passed near Mars. Following the event, Professor Loeb began advocating for the release of these images, which could provide crucial data about the object's nature.</p>
<p>As the U.S. government shutdown delayed the release of these images, Loeb emphasized the need for scientific inquiry over bureaucratic delays. He has since renewed his request for the data, backed by support from Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Scientific knowledge should not be second in priority to bureaucracy,” said Loeb, calling for the release of the HiRISE images.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has sparked significant interest in the scientific community, especially following the unexpected nature of its features, which challenge traditional cometary explanations. Loeb's analysis has drawn parallels to the earlier interstellar object 1I/‘Oumuamua, which also raised questions about its origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory, Earth-based telescopes will again have a clear observational window beginning November 11, 2025. Astronomers plan to monitor its jets and composition leading up to its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Loeb has also placed a public bet regarding the discovery of technological evidence related to 3I/ATLAS by December 31, 2030.</p>
