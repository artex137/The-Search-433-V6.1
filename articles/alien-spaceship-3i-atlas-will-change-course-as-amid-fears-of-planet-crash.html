      <h2>'Alien spaceship' 3I/ATLAS will 'change course' as amid fears of planet crash</h2>

<p>Research has revealed that comet 3I/ATLAS may experience a significant course change due to a close encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026. Experts have raised concerns that this interstellar object could collide with the planet, which would alter its trajectory as it exits the solar system.</p>

<p>This encounter matters because it could impact the comet's path and provide insights into its origins. Astronomers have been studying 3I/ATLAS since its discovery in July 2025, and they continue to investigate its trajectory and potential interactions with other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025.</li>
<li>It is expected to encounter Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
<li>The comet is predicted to approach within 0.355 astronomical units (au) of Jupiter.</li>
<li>3I/ATLAS is believed to have originated from the Sagittarius constellation.</li>
<li>The comet has a mean radial velocity of -57.995 ± 0.011 km/s towards Sagittarius and 58.01 ± 0.01 km/s towards Gemini.</li>
<li>Experts have suggested there could be a stronger perturbation from Jupiter compared to Mars due to its proximity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. Since then, astronomers have been tracking its path and studying its characteristics. The latest research indicates that the comet will have a close encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026, which could significantly affect its trajectory.</p>

<p>Experts have also noted that the comet is moving with a velocity that aligns with predictions for objects from the Milky Way's 'thick disk'. They are working to model its trajectory and potential interactions with other planets before it exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"This thing's coming in much faster than the other two, but it is actually within the range of velocities that we would predict in objects," said Chris Lintott, Professor of Astrophysics and Citizen Science Lead at the University of Oxford.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"The long-term orbital integration of 500 statistical clones of comet 3I for hundred years in the past and future shows that the comet is coming from the Sagittarius constellation," the research team stated in their findings.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects and their origins. Previous studies have suggested that objects like 3I/ATLAS could provide valuable information about the formation of our solar system and the broader galaxy. The potential for a collision with Jupiter adds urgency to ongoing research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter and refine their models of its trajectory. The outcome of the close encounter will be crucial for understanding the comet's future path and origins.</p>
