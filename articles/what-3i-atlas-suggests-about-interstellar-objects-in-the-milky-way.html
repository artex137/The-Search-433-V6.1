      <h2>What 3I/ATLAS suggests about interstellar objects in the Milky Way</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, marking it as the third recorded interstellar visitor to the Solar System. Harvard Professor Avi Loeb reported that the object traveled through the Solar System for approximately 8,000 years before its detection. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this discovery.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that interstellar objects similar to 3I/ATLAS may be far more numerous than previously recorded. Loeb estimates a population of approximately 10²³ such objects in the Milky Way alone. Authorities are currently developing methods to better detect and study these objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Midpoint passage:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum distance from the Sun:</strong> 203 million kilometers (1.36 AU)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated population of similar objects:</strong> 10²³ in the Milky Way</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated number of objects in the Solar System:</strong> 1 trillion at any given time</li>
    <li><strong>Mass per star:</strong> Approximately one-sixth of Earth's mass</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. On October 29, 2025, it reached the midpoint of its passage through the Solar System, at a distance of 203 million kilometers from the Sun. Observations have continued since its discovery, revealing insights about its composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, it represents a population of objects totaling approximately 10²³ in the Milky Way galaxy alone,” said Professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that interstellar objects are common in the Milky Way. This follows previous findings of other interstellar visitors, which have prompted further interest in the study of these celestial bodies. The implications of this research could reshape our understanding of mass distribution and material processing in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are developing a three-layer screening approach for identifying interstellar objects, which includes wide-field survey telescopes and high-resolution imaging methods. Further studies will aim to confirm the natural origins of 3I/ATLAS and explore potential technological features.</p>
