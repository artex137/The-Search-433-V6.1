      <h2>Interstellar Object 31/ATLAS Disappears After Perihelion, Set to Reappear in December</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has reported that the interstellar object 31/ATLAS has passed its perihelion, the point in its orbit closest to the Sun, and is now hidden from view as it travels behind the Sun. The European Space Agency (ESA) noted that 31/ATLAS came within 130 million miles of the Sun on October 30, 2023.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights the ongoing study of interstellar objects and their behavior. Scientists are interested in the physical characteristics of 31/ATLAS, especially as it sheds dust and ice, forming a luminous coma. The object is expected to reappear in December when it moves to the other side of its orbit.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 31/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Distance to Sun:</strong> 130 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Beyond 93 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Next Visibility:</strong> December 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2023, 31/ATLAS reached its perihelion, coming within 130 million miles of the Sun. As it passed this point, the object began to move behind the Sun, becoming invisible from Earth.</p>
<p>The ESA reported that, during its perihelion, 31/ATLAS released gases from its surface, resulting in the formation of a coma. The object is expected to become visible again in December 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As frozen gases vaporized from its surface, the comet shed dust and ice into space, forming a luminous coma,” an ESA scientist said in a press release.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects like 31/ATLAS has gained traction since the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. These objects provide valuable information about the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own. Avi Loeb has proposed that such objects may not be entirely natural, adding a layer of intrigue to their study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 31/ATLAS as it approaches visibility in December 2023. Further observations may provide insights into its composition and behavior as an interstellar object.</p>
