      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Reappears After Passing Behind the Sun</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reappeared in the sky after passing behind the Sun, with astronomers from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona confirming its visibility. Despite NASA's advanced imaging technology, the space agency has struggled to capture a clear picture of the comet, which is moving at high speed and low visibility near the Sun.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it provides scientists a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object passing close to Earth. Astronomers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, with expectations of further observations as its position changes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29, coming within 1.4 astronomical units (130 million miles or 210 million kilometers) from the Sun.</li>
  <li>It is traveling at speeds of approximately 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
  <li>The comet's first optical image post-perihelion was captured by Qicheng Zhang on November 2.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is now visible to amateur astronomers using small telescopes across the Northern Hemisphere.</li>
  <li>The comet is expected to move 25 to 30 degrees away from the Sun within a week, improving visibility for larger telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, briefly disappearing from Earth’s view as it passed behind the Sun. Astronomers tracked its trajectory using data from various space telescopes. The comet reappeared and was observed again on November 2, when Qicheng Zhang captured its first optical image after perihelion.</p>
<p>The comet is anticipated to become more visible in the coming days as it rises higher above the horizon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite the obstruction, scientists and amateur astronomers tracked its trajectory using data from various space telescopes,” said Qicheng Zhang, who captured the first image post-perihelion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Anyone with a clear sky and a low eastern horizon can spot the comet as a faint smudge that will gradually become more visible,” Zhang added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object observed passing through our solar system. Early theories speculated it could be an alien probe, but scientists now confirm it behaves like a natural comet. Studies suggest that 3I/ATLAS could be older than our solar system, possibly by about three billion years, with its surface altered by space radiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. Researchers expect to study how its icy surface sublimates into gas, which will help determine its chemical composition and structure.</p>
