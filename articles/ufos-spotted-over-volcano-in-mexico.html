      <h2>UFOs spotted over volcano in Mexico</h2>

<p>Mysterious unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been filmed above the Popocatépetl volcano in Mexico. The footage was captured by a camera that monitors the volcano's activity continuously. The video reportedly shows dozens of small lights circling above the crater for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>This sighting has drawn attention from both scientists and the public. Authorities have noted that the Popocatépetl volcano has a history of strange activity, leading to ongoing speculation about its potential as a site for extraterrestrial encounters. Alejandro Rojas, an advisor to Enigma Labs, has analyzed the footage and stated that he did not find anything unusual in the video.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Popocatépetl volcano, Mexico</li>
    <li>Duration of UFO sighting: 30 minutes</li>
    <li>Expert analysis: Alejandro Rojas, Enigma Labs</li>
    <li>Previous sightings: Reports of a black pyramid-shaped UFO over Texas</li>
    <li>Camera type: Continuous monitoring</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent days, a video surfaced showing small lights above the Popocatépetl volcano. The footage captures the lights for a duration of 30 minutes. Experts have been studying the video to understand the nature of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Alejandro Rojas has provided insights into the video, stating that the perceived speed of the objects may be misleading. He emphasized that the movement of the lights could be interpreted differently based on the camera's perspective.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What appears to be moving quickly is actually moving much slower. Thus, airplanes, satellites, or anything else that enters the frame will appear to be rushing by when they are not,” said Alejandro Rojas, advisor to Enigma Labs.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Popocatépetl volcano has been associated with various reports of unusual activity for several decades. Some scientists and enthusiasts speculate that it may serve as a portal for extraterrestrial ships. In addition, there have been other recent sightings of unidentified objects, including a black pyramid-shaped UFO over Texas, which remained in view for about two minutes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the latest UFO sighting may continue, as experts analyze the footage further. There are no current plans for formal inquiries regarding the sightings at this time.</p>
