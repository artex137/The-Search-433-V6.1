      <h2>US Military Attempts to Shoot Down Mysterious UAP</h2>

<p>On September 9, 2025, during a Congressional hearing, U.S. military officials discussed a failed attempt to shoot down an unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) off the coast of Yemen. The incident involved a MQ-9 drone firing a Hellfire missile at an "orb"-like object, which sustained damage but continued on its path, according to testimony from witnesses.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as it highlights the ongoing investigations into UAPs and the U.S. government's efforts to provide transparency regarding these phenomena. The hearing, led by Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Missouri, included testimony from military veterans and has reignited public interest in the subject, especially following previous hearings in recent years.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 drone tracked an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen. The drone fired a Hellfire missile at the object, which appeared to sustain some damage but continued its course.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2025, Rep. Eric Burlison presented the video of the incident during a Congressional hearing on UAPs. The video was shown publicly for the first time, generating significant interest and discussion among lawmakers and the public.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Greenlight given to engage, missile appears to be ineffective against the target," said Rep. Eric Burlison in a post on social media after the hearing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings," stated Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, ahead of the hearing.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing marks the third discussion on UAPs in Congress over the past three years, following heightened interest and testimony in July 2023. Witnesses have included military personnel and journalists, who have described secret programs aimed at retrieving and studying UAPs. The Pentagon has consistently stated that there is no evidence linking UAPs to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident are ongoing, with an independent review of the video currently underway. Congress continues to push for more information from the federal government regarding UAP sightings and the military's responses to them.</p>
