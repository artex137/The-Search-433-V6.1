      <h2>The Quiet from NASA: When Silence Becomes the Story</h2>

<p>NASA has not released new data on comet 3I/ATLAS since early October, raising questions about the object’s unusual characteristics and its implications for scientific understanding. The comet, which is roughly the size of Manhattan and weighs an estimated 33 billion tons, has sparked global interest due to its intense blue spectrum and unusual non-gravitational drift as it approaches perihelion.</p>

<p>The absence of information from NASA has led to speculation and scrutiny from the scientific community. Observers have noted that the blue light emitted by 3I/ATLAS is far brighter than typical solar-reflected hues seen in comets, leading to theories about its composition and potential non-natural origins. Meanwhile, Europe’s JUICE spacecraft is set to observe the comet in November 2025, possibly providing new insights into its nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
<li>It weighs an estimated 33 billion tons.</li>
<li>The comet exhibits an intense blue spectrum not typical of standard comets.</li>
<li>NASA has not released any new data or official statements since early October.</li>
<li>Europe’s JUICE spacecraft will attempt to observe 3I/ATLAS in November 2025.</li>
<li>NASA's HiRISE camera stopped providing updates in early October.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October 2023, NASA's HiRISE camera ceased updates on 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>On October 6, 2023, astronomers noted an unusual intensity of blue light from the comet.</p>
<p>Independent researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) released calculations indicating a non-gravitational drift of the comet.</p>
<p>In mid-November 2023, telescopes on Earth and in space are expected to provide additional data on the comet.</p>
<p>In November 2025, Europe’s JUICE spacecraft may capture images of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA has maintained complete radio silence, offering neither clarification nor context about the blue-light anomaly or the deviation noted by JPL analysts.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This silence from NASA is unusual, as the agency typically shares findings with transparency. The lack of communication has become a focal point of criticism, raising doubts about institutional readiness to address phenomena that challenge existing scientific models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As public interest grows, scientists and observers await new data from upcoming observations by JUICE and other telescopes. The scientific community continues to seek clarification from NASA regarding 3I/ATLAS and its unusual characteristics.</p>
