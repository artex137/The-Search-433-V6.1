      <h2>3I/ATLAS: All there is to know about rare comet from another star system</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS, identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope network in Río Hurtado, Chile, has generated significant interest among astronomers and the public. This interstellar comet is travelling along a hyperbolic trajectory and will not return to our solar system after its passage.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it represents only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. Researchers are eager to study its unique composition, which may offer insights into the formation of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope network.</li>
    <li>Official designation: C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), later upgraded to 3I.</li>
    <li>Travelling at approximately 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun expected in late October, at a distance of around 1.4 astronomical units (approximately 210 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>Expected to become brighter as it approaches the Sun, potentially visible through binoculars or small telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, from Río Hurtado, Chile. After confirming its interstellar origin, astronomers designated it as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS). The designation was later upgraded to 3I, recognizing its status as the third known interstellar object. The comet is currently moving toward its closest approach to the Sun, which is anticipated in late October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The appearance of 3I/ATLAS provides a valuable observational window for scientists to gather data before it departs our solar system,” said an astronomer from the ATLAS project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it offers a rare opportunity to study a celestial body that has originated from outside our solar system. Previous interstellar objects, such as ʻOumuamua and Comet Borisov, have also sparked curiosity among the scientific community, highlighting the importance of tracking and understanding such visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, aiming to collect as much data as possible before the comet exits the solar system. Observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope, are expected to play a crucial role in this research effort.</p>
