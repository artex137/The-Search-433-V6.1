      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could be turning bright green, surprising new photos reveal</h2>

<p>New photos taken during the total lunar eclipse on September 7 show that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be turning bright green as it approaches the sun. The comet, traveling more than 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h), is currently nearing its closest point to the sun, which is expected on October 29.</p>

<p>This potential change in color is significant as it suggests the comet's increasing proximity to the sun is affecting its composition. Experts have noted that the transformation may be due to the expulsion of rarer chemicals from the comet's core, although no other observations have confirmed this change yet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 11 kilometers wide.</li>
    <li>It was first spotted in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is projected to have a flyby of Mars next month.</li>
    <li>Its minimum distance from the sun will occur on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Photos taken over Namibia during a total lunar eclipse suggest a green hue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023, traveling towards the inner solar system. On September 7, astrophotographers captured images of the comet during the total lunar eclipse, indicating a possible color change to green.</p>
<p>As the comet continues its approach, it is expected to fly by Mars next month before reaching its minimum distance from the sun on October 29.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new images suggest that the comet's increasing proximity to the sun has caused it to 'turn green' as new rarer chemicals are expelled from its core,” reported Spaceweather.com.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The green glow might come from some other mix of gases or dust, mimicking a classic cometary color with unfamiliar chemistry,” Spaceweather.com representatives added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first instance of a comet exhibiting a green hue. In recent years, several comets, including C/2022 E3 and 12P/Pons-Brooks, have displayed similar colors due to the presence of dicarbon, a molecule that can form in the comet's coma. So far, spectroscopic observations have not detected dicarbon in 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to monitor the comet for further observations and confirmations of the color change. 3I/ATLAS is expected to become less visible as it passes the sun but will reappear in a few months before reaching its closest point to Earth in December.</p>
