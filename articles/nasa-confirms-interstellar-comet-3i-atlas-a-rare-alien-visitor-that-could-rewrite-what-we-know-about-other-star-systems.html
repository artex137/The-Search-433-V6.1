      <h2>NASA Confirms Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object, making it only the third confirmed object from outside our solar system observed passing through. The announcement was made on December 14, 2025, with the comet expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 170 million miles (270 million kilometers).</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it could enhance our understanding of the conditions in other star systems. NASA has initiated a comprehensive observing campaign utilizing 12 agency assets to capture and analyze data from the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet designation:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 1.8 AU (approximately 170 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Date of first observation:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>NASA assets involved:</strong> 12</li>
    <li><strong>Key finding:</strong> High CO₂-to-water ratio in the comet's coma</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile first reported the comet. Subsequent observations from various archives confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its interstellar origin. NASA classified 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar comet based on its speed, which is too fast for it to be captured by the Sun's gravity.</p>
<p>The comet is currently undergoing a solar-system-wide observation campaign, with NASA utilizing multiple spacecraft and telescopes to gather data. This includes close observations from Mars and solar missions that have tracked the comet as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We certainly haven’t seen any technosignatures,” said leadership from NASA’s Science Mission Directorate during a public briefing regarding online speculation about alien technology.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed by NASA, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike ‘Oumuamua, which exhibited unusual behavior, 3I/ATLAS has been observed to be active, indicating it has an icy nucleus and a surrounding coma of dust and gas.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue its observation campaign as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth. Scientists hope to gather more data on the comet's composition and behavior before it exits the solar system.</p>
