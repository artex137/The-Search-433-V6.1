      <h2>3I/ATLAS Truth Exposed: Viral Telescope Image Baffles Scientists After Object Appears More Like a Spacecraft Than a Comet</h2>

<p>A mysterious video claiming to show leaked footage of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has gone viral on social media, baffling scientists and observers. The object, seen in a grainy telescope view, appears elongated and structured, looking more like an artificial spacecraft than a typical comet. The footage has been attributed to a 'Japanese Space Agency', but its authenticity remains unverified.</p>

<p>The object, officially discovered on 1 July 2025 by an Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile, is only the third interstellar object ever identified. Since its discovery, Earth has been moving away from 3I/ATLAS as it journeys towards the Sun, now placing it on the opposite side of the Sun, making observation from Earth impossible. The European Space Agency (ESA) is taking steps to study the comet from unique vantage points.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object identified.</li>
    <li>The object is currently on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth.</li>
    <li>ESA's Mars orbiters will observe the comet from 1 to 7 October 2023.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of the comet to Mars will be 30 million km on 3 October 2023.</li>
    <li>ESA's Juice mission will observe 3I/ATLAS from 2 to 25 November 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the ATLAS telescope in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile, officially discovered 3I/ATLAS. Since then, Earth has been moving away from the comet, which is now located on the opposite side of the Sun. This has made it impossible for Earth-based telescopes to observe it.</p>

<p>From 1 to 7 October 2023, ESA's Mars orbiters, Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, will observe the comet as it passes relatively close to Mars. The closest distance will occur on 3 October, when the comet will be 30 million km away from the Mars spacecraft.</p>

<p>ESA's Juice mission will then take its turn, observing 3I/ATLAS from 2 to 25 November 2023, shortly after the comet's closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a rare opportunity for us to study an interstellar object from a unique vantage point,” a spokesperson from the European Space Agency said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar object discovered. The lack of visibility from Earth has led to speculation about its true nature, with viral videos fueling the debate about whether it is a comet or something artificial.</p>

<p>Historically, interstellar objects like 1I/2017 U1 and 2I/Borisov have captured the attention of scientists and the public alike, prompting extensive observation efforts to understand their composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The European Space Agency will continue its observations of 3I/ATLAS in October and November 2023, providing critical data to clarify the object’s nature and composition, and potentially countering the viral theories surrounding it.</p>
