      <h2>Why 3I/Atlas’ alignment is raising questions: Avi Loeb breaks down the 1 in 40,000 odds</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/ATLAS has drawn attention due to its unusual orientation in space, according to Harvard scientist Avi Loeb. The comet, which originated from outside our solar system, has been observed tumbling almost directly toward the Sun, a rare occurrence among comets. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this cosmic phenomenon.</p>

<p>This peculiar alignment has prompted scientists to consider the implications of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb noted that the chances of this alignment occurring by accident are about 1 in 40,000. He argues that further study is crucial, as understanding such rare events can enhance knowledge about interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known object to originate from another star system.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb estimates the odds of its unusual alignment occurring by chance are 1 in 40,000.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has been observed by the Hubble and Webb telescopes.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed as it travels through our solar system, with scientists noting its unusual orientation. The comet's characteristics have been studied using advanced telescopes, with findings suggesting it shares properties typical of comets.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb's commentary on the comet has sparked further discussions within the scientific community regarding its alignment and what it may signify about interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Asking questions does not mean jumping to wild conclusions. Even if 3I/ATLAS turns out to be completely natural, studying it helps scientists learn more about objects that travel between stars."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects have been identified. The study of these objects helps scientists understand the dynamics of space and the potential for discovering new celestial phenomena. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS challenge existing theories about comet behavior and formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor and study 3I/ATLAS to gather more data. No claims have been made regarding the comet being artificial, but its unique alignment will prompt ongoing research to explore its origins and behavior.</p>
