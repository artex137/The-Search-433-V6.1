      <h2>Meteor Shower in Missouri Turns Into Possible UFO Sighting</h2>

<p>A 62-year-old retired physician has reported witnessing a possible UFO while observing a meteor shower in Brumley, Missouri, shortly after midnight on August 13, 2025. The man described a silent, triangular object flying directly over him, which has drawn attention from the National UFO Reporting Center.</p>

<p>This sighting raises questions about unidentified aerial phenomena and has prompted interest from UFO enthusiasts and investigators. Authorities are currently reviewing the report for any additional information or corroboration.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred just after midnight on August 13, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Brumley, Missouri</li>
    <li>Eyewitness: 62-year-old retired physician</li>
    <li>Object described as triangular, approximately 3-4 meters wide</li>
    <li>Object flew silently, without lights or smells</li>
    <li>Closest military base: Fort Leonard Wood, one hour southeast</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the night of August 13, 2025, the eyewitness went outside to view a meteor shower. Approximately ten minutes into his observation, he spotted the triangular object flying from the southwest at a height just above the tree line. The object then disappeared behind a tree line.</p>

<p>The witness noted the lack of sound, lights, or any discernible smell associated with the object. His account was later reported to the National UFO Reporting Center.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “About 10 minutes after I started watching, a small triangular 'craft' flew directly over me coming from the SW. It was just slightly higher than the tree line and ~ 10-12 feet wide,” the witness stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting adds to a growing list of UFO reports across the United States, particularly in areas near military installations. While the proximity of Brumley to Fort Leonard Wood may raise questions, the eyewitness account does not provide evidence of military activity at the time.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The National UFO Reporting Center will likely continue to investigate the sighting, seeking further information or similar reports from others in the area.</p>
