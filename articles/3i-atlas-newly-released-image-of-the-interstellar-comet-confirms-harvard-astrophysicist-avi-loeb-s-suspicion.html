      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Newly Released Image Of The Interstellar Comet Confirms Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb’s Suspicion?</h2>

<p>Satoru Murata has posted a new image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in the ICQ Comet Observations’ Facebook Group. The image was shared as researchers and stargazers await NASA’s HiRISE images from its Mars observer probe, while the European Space Agency (ESA) has already released a less detailed image of the comet. Murata noted that the comet was passing by the galaxy NGC4691, which added to the impression of it being from another world.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it adds to the ongoing discussions about the comet’s characteristics. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has commented on the image, highlighting the presence of multiple jets both towards and away from the Sun. Loeb previously suggested that one of these jets, referred to as an anti-tail, could potentially indicate technological thrusters propelling 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Image posted by Satoru Murata in the ICQ Comet Observations’ Facebook Group.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth expected on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA’s HiRISE images pending; ESA has released a fuzzy image.</li>
    <li>Location of image capture: not disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. Since then, it has attracted significant attention due to its unusual characteristics. Satoru Murata shared a new image of the comet on a Facebook group, while experts await additional images from NASA and ESA.</p>

<p>In previous discussions, Avi Loeb has compiled a list of 12 anomalies associated with the comet. His observations have sparked interest and speculation within the scientific community regarding the nature of these anomalies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb remarked, "The image shows multiple jets both towards and away from the Sun, including an anti-tail and a much longer tightly collimated tail." </blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb has also stated, "There is the more speculative possibility that the anti-tail is a result of technological thrusters, which accelerate 3I/ATLAS away from the Sun through tightly collimated jets that penetrate a million kilometers through the Solar wind because of their high speed."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has led to numerous scientific inquiries and discussions about its origins and behavior. Avi Loeb's previous findings and hypotheses have generated both interest and critique, especially regarding the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<p>This is not the first time astronomical objects have been scrutinized for signs of advanced technology, but 3I/ATLAS has garnered unique attention due to its interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze images and data as they become available, particularly from NASA’s HiRISE probe. The scientific community will monitor the comet's approach to Earth, with the closest encounter scheduled for December 19, 2025.</p>
