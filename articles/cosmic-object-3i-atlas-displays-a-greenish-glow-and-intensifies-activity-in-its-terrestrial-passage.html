      <h2>Cosmic object 3I/ATLAS displays a greenish glow and intensifies activity in its terrestrial passage</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited a significant increase in brightness and a greenish hue as it approaches Earth, with its closest passage scheduled for December 19, 2025. The comet, which is the third confirmed object from outside the Solar System, has shown heightened activity since its perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, in October.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is important for scientists as it provides insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Observations from the Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii have revealed a bright green glow in the comet’s coma, indicating the release of new volatile compounds as the comet’s icy nucleus sublimates due to solar heating.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 200,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observational Sites:</strong> Gemini North Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, ESA's JUICE probe</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in May 2025, located 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun. On October 29, 2025, the comet reached its perihelion, intensifying its activity due to solar heat.</p>
<p>Images captured on November 26, 2025, showed a transition in the comet’s coma from a reddish to a greenish hue. This change correlates with the release of diatomic carbon, which emits light in the green spectrum when excited by solar radiation.</p>
<p>As of December 15, 2025, astronomers are monitoring the comet closely for potential outbursts during its approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The transition from reddish to greenish in the comet’s coma offers vital clues about its internal structure,” said an astronomer from the Gemini Observatory. “It suggests that solar heat is penetrating deeper into the nucleus, releasing different volatile compounds.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its well-defined coma and extensive tails, distinguishing it from previous interstellar objects like ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. The comet’s activity is a result of solar heating, which can cause delayed responses in cometary behavior.</p>
<p>Similar green emissions have been observed in other comets, providing a basis for understanding the chemical processes at work in these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for any eruptive events as it approaches Earth. Ongoing observations will help refine understanding of its characteristics and behavior.</p>
