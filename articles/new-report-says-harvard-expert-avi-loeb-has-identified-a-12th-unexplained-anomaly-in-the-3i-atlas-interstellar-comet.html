      <h2>New report says Harvard expert Avi Loeb has identified a 12th unexplained anomaly in the 3I/Atlas interstellar comet</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has identified a 12th unexplained anomaly in the interstellar comet known as 3I/Atlas, according to a new report. This discovery has intrigued space enthusiasts as it adds to the mystery of the comet, which behaves differently than typical comets observed in our solar system.</p>

<p>The 3I/Atlas comet originates from interstellar space and follows an undefined path into our solar system. Each anomaly contributes to scientists' understanding of interstellar objects, as the comet’s unusual characteristics prompt further investigation into its composition and behavior. Loeb has been studying 3I/Atlas for several months and has noted changes in its movement that do not conform to established comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery of the 12th anomaly reported by Avi Loeb.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is an interstellar comet, not originating from our solar system.</li>
    <li>Loeb has studied the comet for several months.</li>
    <li>Comet exhibits unusual changes in brightness, speed, and direction.</li>
    <li>Each anomaly represents a unique pattern in the comet's behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has been monitoring 3I/Atlas for several months. During this time, he has documented various anomalies in the comet's movement. The recent identification of the 12th anomaly marks a significant point in ongoing research into the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, "The bottom line is to gather as much information as possible before the comet travels beyond range once more."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted that "interstellar objects are fast movers, and once they are out of our solar system, that might be our only chance to study them."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is notable because it does not conform to the behavior of typical comets, which mainly originate from the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud. Loeb's ongoing research raises fundamental questions about the nature of interstellar objects and their formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to track 3I/Atlas, gathering data and observations to better understand the comet's anomalies and what they might reveal about interstellar objects.</p>
