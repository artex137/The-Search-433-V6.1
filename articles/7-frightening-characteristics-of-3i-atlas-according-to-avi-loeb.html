      <h2>7 frightening characteristics of '3I/ATLAS' according to Avi Loeb</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has identified seven unsettling traits of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS during a discussion with Joe Rogan. Loeb claims that 3I/ATLAS, which entered the Solar System at a significantly higher velocity than typical gravitationally bound objects, may not be just another comet.</p>

<p>This discussion highlights the ongoing intrigue surrounding 3I/ATLAS, which has drawn attention from scientists worldwide. Experts are examining its unusual characteristics to better understand its origins and implications for future interstellar exploration.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> Higher than expected for gravitationally bound objects</li>
    <li><strong>Trajectory:</strong> Hyperbolic, suggesting interstellar origin or intentional propulsion</li>
    <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Lacks a visible gas or dust tail</li>
    <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong> Non-gravitational, indicating potential artificial propulsion</li>
    <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Possibly thin or flat, akin to a solar sail</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Objects:</strong> Third known after ‘Oumuamua and Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected as it entered the Solar System, moving at an unusually high velocity. Following its discovery, scientists began to analyze its trajectory and physical characteristics, leading to ongoing debates about its classification. Loeb's insights have sparked discussions about the implications of its features and the possibility of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The hyperbolic trajectory suggests it came from deep interstellar space — or was intentionally propelled,” said Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This very uncertainty exposes how conventional science often avoids confronting radical possibilities,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects that challenge conventional scientific understanding. Its appearance coincides with increasing detections of similar objects and upcoming solar cycle peaks, which may enhance our ability to observe potential extraterrestrial technologies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze its characteristics to determine its true nature. Ongoing observations may provide further insights into interstellar phenomena and the possibility of extraterrestrial exploration efforts.</p>
