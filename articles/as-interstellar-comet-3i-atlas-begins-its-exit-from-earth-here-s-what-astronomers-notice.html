      <h2>As Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Begins Its Exit from Earth, Here’s What Astronomers Notice</h2>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS has become a focal point for astronomers as it begins to drift away from Earth following its closest approach on December 19, 2025. Recent observations have revealed unusual behaviors in the comet, providing scientists with valuable data that challenges existing models of cometary behavior.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it offers a unique opportunity to study an untouched object from a distant star system as it reacts to the Sun's heat. Researchers view 3I/ATLAS as a "pristine" body, providing insights into comet formation beyond our solar system. The data gathered will aid scientists in refining their understanding of cometary rotation and distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>It was observed over 37 nights between July and September 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted using the Two-meter Twin Telescope at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of 3I/ATLAS completes a full rotation every fifteen hours and thirty minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected and tracked as it approached the solar system. Observations began in July 2025, continuing through September. The comet reached its perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, in October 2025, before coming closest to Earth on December 19, 2025. Since then, it has been drifting away from our planet.</p>

<p>During the observation period, astronomers noted the comet's coma changing shape, initially resembling a sun-facing fan of dust before developing a clearer tail. The discovery of "wobbling jets" was made after tracking their movements over several nights.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is the first time such behaviour has been clearly documented in an interstellar visitor,” researchers stated. “Studying its reaction to solar heating helps scientists to test their models of comet formation beyond our own planetary system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discoveries of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, both of which have contributed to our understanding of how distant planetary systems evolve. Unlike typical comets that develop tails streaming away from the Sun, 3I/ATLAS has exhibited a sun-facing anti-tail, which has drawn particular interest from researchers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, astronomers will analyze the data collected during its approach. This research will enhance scientific knowledge and may take years to fully unravel the implications of the comet's behavior.</p>
