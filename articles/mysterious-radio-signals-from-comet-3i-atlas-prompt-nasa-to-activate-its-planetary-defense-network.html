      <h2>Mysterious radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS prompt NASA to activate its planetary defense network</h2>

<p>The global scientific community has heightened its alert status after detecting unusual radio emissions from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, currently traversing the solar system. First identified on July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS celestial scanning system, the comet has become the focus of an extensive observation campaign due to the peculiar nature of its signals.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it marks the activation of NASA’s planetary defense protocols for continuous monitoring of the comet. Researchers are investigating the origin and structure of the radio emissions, which differ from typical cosmic noise and may provide insights into the comet's composition and its extrasolar origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Exceeding 100,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter Estimate:</strong> Between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>First Detection of Radio Signals:</strong> October 24, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Collaborating Agencies:</strong> NASA, ESA, and other global space agencies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA’s ATLAS system first detected comet 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Following this discovery, astronomers observed its unique trajectory and high speed, confirming its interstellar origin.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa captured the anomalous radio emissions from the comet. Initial assessments suggested a natural origin, but further analysis indicated that the signals were focused and persistent, prompting a global monitoring effort.</p>
<p>In response, NASA, in collaboration with other space agencies, redirected powerful telescopes such as the Very Large Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope to study the comet in detail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The nature of these emissions is unprecedented for a comet. We are committed to understanding their origin and implications for our knowledge of interstellar bodies,” said a NASA spokesperson.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This is an extraordinary opportunity to study material from a distant part of the galaxy,” remarked an astronomer involved in the investigation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed to enter our solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The detection of radio signals from the comet has sparked debates within the scientific community regarding their potential origins, including the possibility of exotic materials interacting with solar plasma or even an artificial source.</p>
<p>The event has led organizations dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) to intensify monitoring efforts, reflecting the significance of this discovery in the field of radio astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS closely, aiming to gather high-resolution images and detailed spectroscopic data. This ongoing analysis will help to create a comprehensive chemical profile of the comet, which may yield valuable information about its formation and the conditions in its home star system.</p>
