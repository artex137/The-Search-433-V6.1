      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shines in new image captured after close pass by the sun</h2>

<p>Astronomer Gianluca Masi has captured a new image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on November 19, 2025, as it moves away from the sun following its closest approach, known as perihelion, on October 29. The comet was first discovered on July 1, 2025, and is only the third interstellar object confirmed to visit our solar system.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insight into the evolution of interstellar objects. NASA plans to release additional images of 3I/ATLAS during a press conference today at 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT), showcasing data collected from various agency missions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The new image was captured on November 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Masi used a 10-inch (250 mm) astrograph telescope located at the Virtual Telescope Project in Manciano, Italy.</li>
    <li>The image consists of 11 individual 120-second exposures.</li>
    <li>The observations took place during a public livestream under good atmospheric conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. It made its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025. On November 19, 2025, astronomer Gianluca Masi captured a detailed image of the comet as it moved through the constellation Virgo.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “For me, it is particularly interesting to see how such an interstellar object evolves,” Masi said in an email to Space.com. “Knowing it came from so far away adds a very special flavor to the observations.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed to enter our solar system, following the 2017 flyby of 1I/'Oumuamua and the arrival of 2I/Borisov in 2019. These events have heightened interest in studying the characteristics and origins of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will provide further insights into 3I/ATLAS during its press conference today, detailing findings from recent observations and discussing the implications for future research on interstellar objects.</p>
