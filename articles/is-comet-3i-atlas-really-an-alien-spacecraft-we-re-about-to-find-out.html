      <h2>Is Comet 3I/ATLAS Really an Alien Spacecraft? We’re About To Find Out</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to the sun today, October 29, 2025, raising questions about its nature, including speculation that it may be an alien spacecraft. The perihelion, the point in its orbit closest to the sun, occurred at 11:47 UT (7:47 Eastern Time), according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides scientists with a crucial opportunity to analyze the comet's behavior. Avi Loeb, a professor of science at Harvard University, has described this moment as the "acid test" to determine whether the interstellar object is a natural comet or something more extraterrestrial.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS closest approach occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion time was 11:47 UT (7:47 Eastern Time).</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of the comet on July 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's gas plume consists of 87% carbon dioxide, 9% carbon monoxide, and 4% water.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has ranked the comet's potential technological origin as 4 on the Loeb Scale.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. On July 21, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of the comet from 277 million miles away. Since then, it has been monitored as it approached the sun.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2025, the comet reached its perihelion, where its behavior is being closely analyzed to assess its origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “We have to collect as much data as possible to figure out its nature. The implication of alien technology would be huge and therefore we must take it seriously.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also commented, “Nature is more imaginative than the best script writers for science fiction movies in Hollywood.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known object from outside our solar system to pass through the solar system, following 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The interest in the comet has been heightened due to its unexpected characteristics and the possibility of it being technologically manufactured.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to gather data on 3I/ATLAS in the coming months to determine its nature and origins. Further analysis may reveal more about its trajectory and composition, as well as its implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>
