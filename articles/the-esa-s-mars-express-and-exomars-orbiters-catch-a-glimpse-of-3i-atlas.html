      <h2>The ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Orbiters Catch a Glimpse of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency's (ESA) Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) have provided new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, passing within 30 million km of the orbiters. The observations were made in October 2023, marking a significant opportunity for scientists to study this mysterious object.</p>

<p>The observations are important because they offer insights into the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited unusual characteristics since its discovery. The ESA has stated that the data collected from these orbiters will contribute to understanding the comet's origin and its activity as it nears the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Distance from orbiters: 30 million km (18.64 million mi)</li>
    <li>Observation date: October 2023</li>
    <li>Instruments used: CaSSIS on TGO, HRSC on Mars Express</li>
    <li>Tail length: Estimated at 56,000 km (35,000 mi)</li>
    <li>Next observation opportunity: November 2023 with ESA's JUICE mission</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed as it approaches the Sun, releasing water vapor and forming a coma and tail. The ESA's TGO captured images of the comet in October 2023, while Mars Express collected spectra of the object. The observations are part of ongoing efforts to study the comet's activity and composition.</p>

<p>The TGO utilized its Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) to capture a series of images, although it could not distinguish the nucleus of the coma. The Mars Express orbiter has not yet captured images of 3I/ATLAS due to its shorter exposure time, but data from both orbiters will be analyzed together.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target," said Nick Thomas, Principal Investigator of the CaSSIS camera.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it's always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one. I look forward to seeing what the data reveals following further analysis," said Colin Wilson, a Mars Express and ExoMars project scientist at the ESA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has sparked interest among scientists since its discovery due to its interstellar origin and unusual behavior. It is one of several interstellar objects observed since the first such object, 1I/ʻOumuamua, was discovered in 2017. These observations are crucial for understanding the diversity and nature of interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ESA's JUpiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will observe 3I/ATLAS in November 2023, following its closest approach to the Sun. Data from this observation is expected to be available by February 2024, providing further insights into the comet's activity and composition.</p>
