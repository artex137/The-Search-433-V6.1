      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS posing a threat to humans? Interstellar comet heads toward Earth again with new changes noticed by scientists</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, remaining about 1.8 astronomical units, or roughly 270 million kilometres, away from the planet. Recent observations have noted a brightening of the comet, a change in its colour, the growth of a long ion tail, and the detection of its first radio signal. Authorities have confirmed that the comet poses no danger to Earth.</p>

<p>The significance of these observations has led to increased interest among scientists and the public. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have emphasized that 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory and will not return to the solar system after this flyby. The agencies continue to monitor the comet, which has sparked discussions about its nature, including speculation about potential alien technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 1.8 astronomical units away during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The nearest perihelion occurred around October 30, 2025, at about 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet ever identified, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by astronomers using the ATLAS survey telescope. Subsequent images traced its path back to mid-June, confirming its origin beyond the solar system. The comet reached its perihelion on October 30, 2025, before reappearing in the dawn sky as it moved away from the Sun. Recent observations have shown changes in brightness, colour, and tail structure, leading to increased public interest and scientific analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away,” stated NASA in a report dated July 2025.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This would mean that 3I/ATLAS exploded at perihelion and we are witnessing the resulting fireworks,” claimed Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, regarding the comet's brightening and possible fragmentation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The detection confirms the object is a natural comet, not an alien probe,” said the South Africa’s MeerKAT radio array team about the recent radio signal detected from 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar visitor identified, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates it is not bound to the Sun, meaning it will leave the solar system after this flyby. Previous interstellar objects have sparked similar debates about their origins and potential risks, but experts have consistently reassured the public of their safety.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observations will focus on its physical changes and behaviour as it moves through the solar system. Further updates are expected as scientists gather more data on this unique interstellar comet.</p>
