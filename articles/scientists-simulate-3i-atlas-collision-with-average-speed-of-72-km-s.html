      <h2>Scientists simulate 3I/Atlas collision with average speed of 72 km/s</h2>

<p>Researchers from Universidade Estadual in Michigan have simulated the potential impacts of interstellar comets on Earth, focusing on comet 3I/Atlas. The study, led by Darryl Seligman, reveals that 3I/Atlas, the third interstellar object detected in the Solar System, could approach at an average speed of 72 kilometers per second during a collision. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this research.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it sheds light on the potential hazards posed by high-speed interstellar comets. Authorities and scientists are using these findings to better understand the dynamics of such objects and their possible impacts on Earth, particularly during specific periods when Earth’s orbital position may increase the likelihood of encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Average collision speed:</strong> 72 km/s (259,200 km/h)</li>
    <li><strong>Comparison speed:</strong> Typical asteroids range from 11 to 73 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery of 3I/Atlas:</strong> 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Other interstellar comets:</strong> 1I/'Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated interstellar impacts:</strong> Approximately ten in 4.6 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Research collaboration:</strong> Includes Dušan Marčeta (Universidade de Belgrado) and Eloy Peña-Asensio (Politecnico di Milano)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in 2024, marking it as the third known interstellar comet. Prior to this, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov were identified in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Researchers have conducted simulations to understand the behavior and impact of such comets on Earth.</p>

<p>The simulations concentrated on the dynamics of high-speed impacts, revealing that interstellar comets, including 3I/Atlas, arrive much faster than typical asteroids. The study indicates that these high-speed impacts can lead to different crater shapes and compositions compared to those created by conventional asteroid impacts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The energy released during an impact from an interstellar comet far exceeds that of conventional impacts due to the difference in initial speed,” said Darryl Seligman, lead researcher.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The history of interstellar objects shows that no significant impacts have occurred in the last few million years. The research highlights the rarity of such events, estimating only around ten incidents throughout Earth's 4.6 billion-year history. These findings reinforce the understanding that while interstellar comets can approach Earth, the risk of impact remains low in the short and medium term.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from these simulations to refine their understanding of potential impacts and improve predictive models for future encounters with interstellar objects.</p>
