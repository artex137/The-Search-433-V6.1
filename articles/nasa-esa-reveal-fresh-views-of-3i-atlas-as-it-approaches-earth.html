      <h2>NASA, ESA Reveal Fresh Views of 3I/ATLAS as It Approaches Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is becoming increasingly active as it approaches Earth, according to new images released by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). The comet, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, is expected to make its closest approach at about 1.8 astronomical units, or approximately 170 million miles (270 million km) from Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This observation is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed passing through our solar system. Scientists believe it provides a rare opportunity to study materials from another star system, potentially revealing insights into the formation of planetary systems and the building blocks of life across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 1.8 astronomical units (170 million miles / 270 million km)</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus diameter: 440 meters to 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Not a threat to Earth, confirmed by scientists</li>
    <li>Visible only through telescopes or astrophotography gear</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, scientists began tracking its trajectory and activity levels. On November 30, 2025, high-resolution data from the Hubble Space Telescope revealed subtle jets and a faint tail structure, indicating the comet's increasing activity as it moves through the solar system.</p>
<p>ESA's deep-space missions captured additional images of 3I/ATLAS, providing views of its dust and plasma tails. Observatories worldwide have been monitoring the comet, and they will continue to collect data into early 2026 as its coma and brightness evolve.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This interstellar visitor gives humanity a rare chance to study matter from another star system,” said a NASA spokesperson. “It could teach us about comet formation across the galaxy and the diversity of materials drifting between stars.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its passage offers a unique opportunity for astronomers to gather data that could reshape our understanding of interstellar objects and their compositions compared to local comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As scientists continue to observe 3I/ATLAS, they will analyze its coma's gases and dust for organic molecules and other elements. This research may provide insights into whether the chemical ingredients for life are common across the galaxy.
