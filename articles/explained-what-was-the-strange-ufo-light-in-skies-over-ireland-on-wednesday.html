      <h2>Strange Light in Irish Skies Identified as Falcon 9 Rocket</h2>

<p>On Wednesday evening, a bright light moving across the sky baffled residents in various parts of Ireland, leading many to speculate about a potential UFO sighting. The unusual object was first reported around 6:30 PM over Kildare, with similar sightings reported in Carlow and Co. Mayo. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident has prompted a wave of social media activity as witnesses sought to identify the source of the mysterious light. Experts have since clarified that the object was not extraterrestrial, but rather a Falcon 9 rocket operated by SpaceX, which had recently ejected leftover fuel during its mission.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Time of initial sighting: 6:30 PM on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Locations reported: Kildare, Carlow, Co. Mayo.</li>
    <li>Witness descriptions: Bright light, triangular shape, varying speed.</li>
    <li>Expert confirmation: Object was SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket.</li>
    <li>Incident reported by multiple sources including Carlow Weather.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At approximately 6:30 PM, residents in Kildare began reporting a bright light in the sky. Witnesses described the object as hovering and then vanishing. Similar reports followed from Carlow and Co. Mayo, with descriptions of the object ranging from a bright dot to a triangular shape with lights.</p>

<p>Shortly after, experts began to analyze the phenomenon. Alan O'Reilly from Carlow Weather stated that the light was likely due to the Falcon 9 rocket dumping leftover fuel, which creates a visible light effect when frozen at high altitude.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The light in the sky tonight most likely to be the Falcon 9 dumping fuel in orbit based on latest information. Not aliens this time.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Spotted from the cockpit on approach to Cork on a training flight. Almost triangular in shape with the bottom of the triangle quite bright, almost like lights.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Rocket launches from SpaceX have become increasingly common, with Falcon 9 missions frequently deploying satellites into orbit. The phenomenon of frozen fuel creating visible light has been noted in previous launches, helping to explain similar sightings in the past.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No further investigations are currently planned, as authorities and experts have confirmed the source of the light. The public has been reassured that it was a natural occurrence related to space activities, not an unidentified flying object.</p>
