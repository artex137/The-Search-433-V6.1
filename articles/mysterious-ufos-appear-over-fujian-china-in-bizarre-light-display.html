      <h2>Mysterious UFOs Appear Over Fujian, China in Bizarre Light Display</h2>

<p>On February 10, 2025, around 8:00 p.m., residents of Zhangzhou City in Fujian Province reported seeing bright unidentified flying objects (UFOs) moving rapidly in the sky. Witnesses described the objects initially as point-like before they formed a straight-line formation, eventually multiplying to over ten and forming a circle before disappearing completely.</p>

<p>The sighting has gained significant attention, with videos and photos circulating on social media. Local authorities, including the Zhangzhou city government, have stated they are unaware of the phenomenon. The incident has sparked various speculations online, with some attributing the lights to drones or Starlink satellites.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>Duration of display: About ten seconds</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Witnesses first observed the UFOs around 8:00 p.m. on February 10. Initially, the objects appeared as bright points in the sky.

<blockquote>“The object formed a point in the sky, then spread and lined up in a straight line. At first, I thought it was a drone—it was very bright.” - Mr. Zhang, local witness</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I looked up and suddenly saw two rows of red dot-like things in the sky. They flashed for less than a minute. It was very shocking.” - Another witness</blockquote>
