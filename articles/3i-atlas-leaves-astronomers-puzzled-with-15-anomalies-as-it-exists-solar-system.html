      <h2>3I/ATLAS leaves astronomers puzzled with 15 ‘anomalies’ as it exits solar system</h2>

<p>As of December 19, 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (officially C/2025 N1) is making its closest approach to Earth before continuing its journey out of the Solar System. This third confirmed interstellar comet has raised questions among astronomers due to its unusual characteristics, as reported by NASA and highlighted by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its peculiar behavior, which challenges existing comet classifications. NASA is closely monitoring the comet, providing ongoing updates to the scientific community and the public. Loeb has documented 15 anomalies that suggest 3I/ATLAS may not conform to traditional comet expectations, prompting further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is making its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was discovered in early 2025 by the ATLAS survey.</li>
    <li>NASA continues to monitor the comet and has provided updates.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has identified 15 anomalies related to the comet's behavior.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a retrograde orbit, moving counter to most planets.</li>
    <li>The comet has passed by multiple planets, including Jupiter, Mars, and Venus, without disruption.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early 2025 by the ATLAS survey. Since then, NASA has been actively monitoring the comet as it approaches Earth. As of December 18, 2025, NASA confirmed its continued observations and planned a public Reddit AMA for December 19, 2025, to address questions about the comet.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has compiled a list of 15 anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS that challenge conventional comet theories. These anomalies include a jet pointing toward the Sun, a tightly collimated jet, and stable jet direction over time, among others.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We're continuing to observe the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it heads out of our solar system.” – NASA</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet, following 'Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1) and 2I/Borisov. Previous interstellar visitors have also prompted discussions regarding their nature and origins, with Loeb previously suggesting that 'Oumuamua may have been an artificial probe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it exits the solar system. Ongoing analysis of the comet's anomalies may lead to new insights into its composition and behavior, and further discussions are expected within the scientific community regarding its implications.</p>
