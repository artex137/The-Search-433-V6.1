      <h2>World should draft UFO policy, says professor eyeing strange comet</h2>

<p>Professor Avi Loeb has called for the international community to draft a policy on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) as he examines a newly discovered comet, identified as C/2023 A3. Loeb made his remarks during a recent conference held in Toronto, Canada, where he presented his findings on the comet's unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>The need for a comprehensive UFO policy is pressing, according to Loeb, as many nations have reported encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena. Current regulations are insufficient to address the potential risks and implications of such encounters, he said. Loeb is a prominent astrophysicist and the founding director of the Institute for Theory and Computation at Harvard University.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred during a conference in Toronto, Canada.</li>
    <li>Comet C/2023 A3 has displayed unusual characteristics.</li>
    <li>Professor Avi Loeb is the founding director of the Institute for Theory and Computation at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>Loeb advocates for international collaboration on UFO policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the conference, which took place on October 5, 2023, Professor Loeb presented his analysis of comet C/2023 A3. He highlighted its strange features and linked them to broader discussions about UFOs.</p>

<p>Loeb's call for a unified UFO policy has gained attention in light of increasing reports of UFO sightings worldwide. He emphasized the need for a structured approach as more data becomes available.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We need a coordinated effort to understand what these phenomena are and how we can respond to them,” said Professor Loeb during his presentation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In recent years, numerous governments have released reports detailing encounters with UFOs. This has sparked a renewed interest in the subject, prompting scientists and policymakers to consider the implications of such phenomena. Existing policies vary significantly among nations, with many lacking a cohesive framework.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb plans to continue his research on comet C/2023 A3 and engage with international bodies to discuss the formation of a global UFO policy. Further findings from his research are expected to be published in the coming months.</p>
