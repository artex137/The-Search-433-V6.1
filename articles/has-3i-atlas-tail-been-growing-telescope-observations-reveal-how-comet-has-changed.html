      <h2>Has 3I/ATLAS' tail been growing? Telescope observations reveal how comet has changed</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, has been observed by the Gemini South telescope in Chile, revealing that its tail has been steadily growing as it approaches the sun. The comet poses no threat to Earth, but astronomers and space agencies are seizing the opportunity to study its unique properties. Observations made on August 27 indicate significant changes in the comet's tail and coma, which have sparked interest among the scientific community.</p>

<p>This event is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever confirmed in Earth's solar system. Scientists are eager to gather data on its composition and behavior, as it provides insight into planetary materials from another star. The comet is expected to come within 130 million miles of the sun on October 30 and reappear in December for further study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is over 12 miles wide and traveling at 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>It will approach the sun on October 30, 2025, at a distance of about 130 million miles.</li>
    <li>The comet was first detected by a telescope in Chile, part of the ATLAS system.</li>
    <li>Observations show the tail is significantly more extended than earlier images indicated.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes have also observed the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was confirmed to have originated outside Earth's solar system. The discovery made headlines as it became only the third known interstellar object. The first was Comet Oumuamua in 2017, followed by Comet Borisov in 2019. On August 6, the James Webb Space Telescope captured images of the comet in near-infrared light, followed by observations from SPHEREx from August 7 to August 15. The latest findings from the Gemini South telescope were reported on September 4.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet’s tail is significantly more extended than it appeared in earlier images, suggesting that 3I/ATLAS has become more active as it travels through the inner solar system,” said NOIRLab in a September 4 press release.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, interstellar objects were exceedingly rare, with only two others confirmed. The study of such comets provides valuable information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems in different star systems. The similarities between the materials of 3I/ATLAS and native comets further suggest common processes in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, with further data expected in December when the comet reappears. Ongoing studies will help researchers understand its physical properties and chemical makeup as it travels through the solar system.</p>
