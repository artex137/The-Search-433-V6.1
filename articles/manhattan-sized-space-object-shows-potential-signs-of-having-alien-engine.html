      <h2>Manhattan-Sized Space Object Shows Potential Signs Of Having Alien 'Engine'</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object the size of Manhattan, has recently exhibited signs of non-gravitational acceleration as it passed near the Sun, according to NASA and Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The object, which is expected to come within 167 million miles of Earth on December 19, 2025, has raised questions about its nature, with some suggesting it could be a spacecraft.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing understanding of comet behavior and raises the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. NASA has recorded the object's unusual acceleration, which indicates substantial outgassing—a typical feature of comets. Researchers are preparing to study the object further during its upcoming close approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, size comparable to Manhattan</li>
    <li>Current proximity to the Sun: 172 million miles</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 167 million miles</li>
    <li>Notable observation: Object appears “bluer than the Sun”</li>
    <li>Researcher: Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li>Significant findings: Non-gravitational acceleration and rapid brightening</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has exhibited notable changes in its behavior since its discovery. In a recent analysis, NASA confirmed the object's non-gravitational acceleration, which is typically indicative of substantial outgassing. Avi Loeb published insights on the object's unique color and acceleration characteristics on Medium, suggesting possible artificial origins.</p>
<p>As the object approaches Earth, researchers are preparing to conduct detailed observations during its closest pass to gather more data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “This might also explain the report on 3I/ATLAS getting ‘bluer than Sun.’”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb further noted, “It could potentially be explained by a hot engine or source of artificial light.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS challenge conventional comet classifications, as its behavior has deviated from typical patterns. Previous observations noted the object’s coloration changing from red to green before its recent blue appearance, which has surprised researchers.</p>
<p>This incident follows a trend of increased interest in unidentified aerial phenomena and interstellar objects, prompting organizations like NASA to enhance their monitoring efforts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to observe 3I/ATLAS closely during its December 19 approach to determine whether it is a comet or an artificial construct. Further studies are expected to clarify the object's unusual characteristics and potential implications for our understanding of space technology.</p>
