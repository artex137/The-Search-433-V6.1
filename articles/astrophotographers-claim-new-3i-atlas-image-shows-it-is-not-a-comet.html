      <h2>Astrophotographers Claim New 3I/ATLAS Image Shows It Is Not a Comet</h2>

<p>NASA has affirmed its conclusion that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, despite an increasing number of scientists arguing that this interstellar object may possess characteristics unlike any previously documented. First detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS travels on a hyperbolic orbit at high speed, indicating it originated outside the Solar System.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as astronomers race to understand the unique properties of 3I/ATLAS, which is only the third interstellar object ever recorded. The object’s unusual chemical composition, erratic brightness, and CO₂-rich coma have sparked debates regarding its classification.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The object travels on a hyperbolic orbit, confirming its interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS displays an unusual CO₂-dominant chemical profile.</li>
    <li>NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet based on its observable features.</li>
    <li>The object is only the third interstellar object ever recorded.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025 during observations conducted by the ATLAS survey telescope. It has since been monitored by various telescopes worldwide, including the James Webb Space Telescope, which revealed its distinctive CO₂-rich chemical profile. As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey back into deep space, astronomers are making urgent efforts to collect final observations before it becomes too faint to detect.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nicky Fox, a NASA official, stated, "It looks and behaves like a comet. All evidence points to it being a comet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS presents unique challenges for scientists as it does not fit neatly into existing comet categories. Unlike the two previously confirmed interstellar objects, 'Oumuamua and Borisov, which exhibited different characteristics, 3I/ATLAS displays traits of both a comet and an atypical object. This has led to discussions about the diversity of small bodies across the Milky Way and the implications for our understanding of protoplanetary discs in other solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to gather and analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it moves further away. The findings may either reinforce NASA's classification of the object as a comet or lead to alternative theories about its nature.</p>
