      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS sent by advanced civilizations to 'seed' life on Earth? Harvard scientist's big claim</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has claimed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may have been sent by advanced civilizations to "seed" life on Earth. This assertion was made during a recent discussion on the potential origins of the comet, which was first detected in 2022.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked interest within the scientific community, prompting researchers to explore the implications of extraterrestrial life and its possible influence on Earth. Authorities have not disclosed any ongoing investigations related to this theory, but discussions continue among scientists regarding the origins and trajectory of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected in 2022.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a professor of astrophysics at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>The comet is classified as interstellar.</li>
    <li>Loeb's theory suggests it may have been sent by advanced civilizations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2022, astronomers detected comet 3I/ATLAS as it approached the solar system. Since then, scientists have studied its trajectory and characteristics. Avi Loeb presented his theory regarding the comet's potential purpose in recent discussions, generating significant interest and debate.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The possibility that 3I/ATLAS was sent by advanced civilizations opens up new avenues for understanding our place in the universe."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This claim aligns with ongoing discussions in the scientific community about the existence of extraterrestrial life. Previous studies have examined unidentified aerial phenomena and their implications, but the connection to a comet offers a new perspective on the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data regarding comet 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory, while discussions about the implications of Loeb's claims are expected to unfold in scientific circles.</p>
