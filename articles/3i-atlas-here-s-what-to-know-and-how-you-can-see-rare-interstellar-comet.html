      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Here’s What To Know And How You Can See Rare Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025. Discovered on July 1 by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, scientists have tracked the comet as it approaches our planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant because 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system. NASA has stated that ongoing observations have confirmed its interstellar origin through its trajectory and velocity. People can observe the comet from home using ground-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass within approximately 167 million miles of Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at speeds of up to 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach will pose no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Current observations indicate the comet was about 178 million miles from Earth as of November 30.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope. Since then, scientists have monitored its trajectory and composition. The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 167 million miles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This makes it fascinating, exciting, and scientifically very important,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya regarding the comet's interstellar origin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When 3I/ATLAS is closest to the Earth, all the features that we are looking for will be easier to detect with our telescopes,” said Darryl Z. Seligman, Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan State University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object confirmed to traverse our solar system. Its discovery adds to the growing understanding of celestial bodies originating outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will continue to observe it to gather more data about its characteristics and composition during its closest approach on December 19.</p>
