      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Pulses Every 16 Hours — But It Won't Affect Callisto</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected a consistent, heartbeat-like pulse from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which brightens and dims every 16.16 hours. The object, first detected on 1 July by the ATLAS sky-survey project, has generated interest and speculation about its potential impact on Jupiter's moon Callisto. However, scientists have confirmed that the effect is purely optical and poses no threat to Jupiter, its moons, or the wider Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it provides insight into the behaviour of interstellar objects and the processes that govern their brightness. NASA has stated that the flickering is due to reflected sunlight, not a change in mass, orbit, or energy output. Researchers are now investigating the possibility that jets of gas and dust may be responsible for the observed brightness changes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First detected: 1 July 2023</li>
    <li>Pulsing cycle: Every 16.16 hours</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size: 2.8 km in radius</li>
    <li>Observation method: Hubble Space Telescope</li>
    <li>No threat to Jupiter or Callisto confirmed by NASA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2023, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS sky-survey project. Subsequent observations revealed a pulsing brightness every 16.16 hours, prompting further investigation into its cause. On 21 July, NASA published Hubble Space Telescope observations that indicated most of the light from the object comes from its coma, rather than its solid nucleus.</p>

<p>As researchers examined the data, they shifted their focus from rotation as the sole explanation for the brightness changes to the possibility of periodic jets of gas and dust. This theory suggests that as 3I/ATLAS rotates, areas rich in frozen material warm up under sunlight, causing jets that can reflect more light.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The pulsing does not affect Jupiter or its moon Callisto in any way,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This change is purely a light phenomenon, not a change in size, mass, or trajectory.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed, offering a unique opportunity to study the chemistry and behaviour of bodies formed around distant stars. Previous interstellar objects have also generated interest, but 3I/ATLAS's consistent brightness changes have led to widespread speculation about potential unusual phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct more continuous, long-duration observations to confirm whether the brightening events consistently correspond to the same region rotating into sunlight. These observations will help strengthen the jet activity explanation and further our understanding of 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey through the Solar System.</p>
