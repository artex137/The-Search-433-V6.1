      <h2>Greenish glow of interstellar visitor Comet 3I/ATLAS revealed in new Gemini North image</h2>

<p>A new image of Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar visitor to our solar system, has been captured by the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawai’i, as the comet makes its closest pass by Earth tonight, December 19. The image reveals the comet emitting a faint greenish glow after re-emerging from behind the sun.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it highlights the ongoing monitoring of Comet 3I/ATLAS as it exits the solar system. The imaging session was part of a public outreach initiative called Shadow the Scientists, which invites students to join researchers in observing astronomical phenomena. The Gemini North telescope is operated by the National Science Foundation NOIRLab and is part of the International Gemini Observatory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Gemini North telescope, Mauna Kea, Hawai’i</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor to the solar system</li>
    <li>Observation conducted as part of a Shadow the Scientists outreach initiative</li>
    <li>Previous images showed the comet appearing red before the recent green glow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 26, scientists used the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph to capture images of Comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet was observed close to Zaniah, a triple-star system in the constellation Virgo, after it re-emerged from behind the sun. The new images show changes in the comet's appearance following its closest approach to the sun.</p>

<p>Earlier images taken during a Shadow the Scientists session at Gemini South in Chile revealed the comet’s red coloration, attributed to gases in its coma. As the comet nears the sun, these gases evaporate and change the emitted light spectrum.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Sharing an observing experience in some of the best conditions available gives the public a truly front-row view of our interstellar visitor,” said Bryce Bolin, a research scientist at Eureka Scientific, in a NOIRLab release.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Allowing the public to see what we do as astronomers and how we do it also helps demystify the scientific and data collection process, adding transparency to our study of this fascinating object,” Bolin added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader effort to engage the public in scientific research. Programs like Shadow the Scientists aim to connect learners with researchers, fostering interest in astronomy and scientific exploration.</p>

<p>Comets often exhibit changes in their behavior as they approach and depart from the sun. The current monitoring of 3I/ATLAS will help scientists understand its gas composition and potential outbursts as it cools down after leaving the sun's vicinity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Gemini North will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it exits the solar system, observing any changes in its gas composition and potential outburst behavior. Further findings will contribute to the understanding of interstellar comets and their characteristics.</p>
