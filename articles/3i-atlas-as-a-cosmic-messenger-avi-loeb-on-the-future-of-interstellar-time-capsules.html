      <h2>3I/ATLAS as a cosmic messenger: Avi Loeb on the future of interstellar time capsules</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, first reported on July 1, 2025, has sparked significant discussion among astronomers and the public alike, particularly regarding its potential alien origins. Harvard physicist Avi Loeb, a key figure in this discourse, stated that the comet exhibited no unusual activity when it passed Earth on December 19, 2025. On December 21, 2025, Loeb published an essay proposing that interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS could serve as faster means to send time capsules into interstellar space.</p>

<p>This discussion matters as it opens new possibilities for humanity to communicate with extraterrestrial life. Loeb's ideas challenge traditional methods of space exploration and emphasize the potential of utilizing natural interstellar objects for sending messages beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first reported on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It passed Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb published his paper on December 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of 60 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Voyager 1 travels at a speed of 17 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Loeb estimates 3I/ATLAS could reach interstellar space by approximately 10,000 CE.</li>
    <li>Voyager 1 is projected to reach the solar system's limit in another 28,000 years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first reported the discovery of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, during which it displayed behavior typical of natural comets. Following this event, Avi Loeb published an essay on December 21, 2025, where he discussed the potential of 3I/ATLAS as a vehicle for sending time capsules into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "If we are impatient in establishing physical contact with extraterrestrials, we can attempt to do better in reaching our cosmic neighbors with technological artifacts."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb concluded, "Riding 3I/ATLAS offers the benefit of reaching interstellar space by the year ~10,000 CE instead of the year ~30,000 CE."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding interstellar objects is gaining traction as scientists explore new methods for communicating with extraterrestrial life. The Voyager program, which launched Voyager 1 and 2 in 1977, attached the “Voyager Golden Records” to send messages from Earth. However, Loeb's proposals suggest a shift towards leveraging natural interstellar phenomena for faster communication.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb's ideas could lead to further exploration of interstellar objects as potential time capsule carriers. Researchers may investigate the feasibility of attaching records to these objects or developing technologies to carve messages onto them. The scientific community is expected to continue studying 3I/ATLAS and similar bodies for their potential in interstellar communication.</p>
