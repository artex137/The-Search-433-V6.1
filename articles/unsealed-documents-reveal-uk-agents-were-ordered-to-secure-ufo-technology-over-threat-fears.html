      <h2>Unsealed documents reveal UK agents were ordered to secure UFO technology over threat fears</h2>

<p>Unsealed government files have shown that the British military once investigated the potential acquisition of UFO technology due to concerns about unexplained aerial phenomena. The documents, released from the National Archives in London, detail efforts made by the UK’s Defence Intelligence staff during the 1990s to examine a series of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) sightings reported in Belgium from November 1989 to April 1990.</p>

<p>The investigation highlights the military's apprehension that these sightings might not only be genuine but could also pose a threat to national security. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has since stated that they no longer pursue investigations into UFOs or UAPs, prioritizing other defense activities instead.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documents released from the National Archives in London.</li>
    <li>UK Defence Intelligence began investigating UAPs in the 1990s.</li>
    <li>Thousands of sightings reported in Belgium between November 1989 and April 1990.</li>
    <li>The MoD ceased UFO investigations in 2009.</li>
    <li>Minister for Defence Readiness Luke Pollard has confirmed no current projects on UFOs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the UK Defence Intelligence staff began to investigate a surge in UAP sightings. In March 1997, internal memos expressed concern about the implications of these sightings for national defence.</p>
<p>Reports from this period highlighted sightings of large, silent, low-flying black triangles that demonstrated capabilities beyond known aircraft. The investigation also revisited the 1980 Rendlesham Forest incident, where a glowing craft reportedly landed near a US Air Force base.</p>
<p>By December 2024, Luke Pollard confirmed that the MoD had ceased investigations into UFO sightings since 2009, indicating a shift in focus to other defence priorities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The MoD ceased to investigate reports of UFOs or UAP in 2009. It has been deemed more valuable to prioritise staff towards other defence-related activities.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The MoD’s position remains unchanged, which is that, in over 50 years, no sighting reported to the department has indicated the existence of any military threat to the UK.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documents reveal a historical concern within the UK military regarding UAPs, particularly during the late 20th century. The reports noted the advanced capabilities of these unidentified objects, which could hover and accelerate at speeds surpassing military jets, leading to speculation about their technological significance.</p>
<p>Despite the interest in UAPs among military officials, the MoD has maintained that no credible threat has been substantiated from the reported sightings, leading to a pivot away from ongoing investigations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no plans for the MoD to initiate any new investigations into UFO sightings or UAPs. The focus remains on other defence-related activities, with no dedicated team for UFO inquiries anticipated in the near future.</p>
