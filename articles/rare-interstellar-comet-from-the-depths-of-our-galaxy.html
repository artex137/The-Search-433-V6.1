      <h2>Rare Interstellar Comet from the Depths of Our Galaxy</h2>

<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS telescope discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it entered our Solar System, marking it as the third interstellar object ever detected. The previous two were 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet is expected to disappear behind the Sun in October and reappear in November.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it provides astronomers with a unique opportunity to study materials from outside our Solar System. Researchers from NASA’s JWST team have begun analyzing the comet, revealing unusual properties that could shed light on its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Objects:</strong> 1I/’Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Expected to Disappear:</strong> October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Expected to Reappear:</strong> November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Analysis by:</strong> NASA’s JWST team</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS telescope first detected 3I/ATLAS entering the Solar System. As it approached the Sun, astronomers began observing its characteristics. In the months following its discovery, researchers identified a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the comet's gases using data from the JWST.</p>

<p>The analysis indicated that the comet has likely been exposed to ultraviolet light and cosmic rays, suggesting it originated from a stellar system with a higher carbon dioxide presence than our own. Further studies confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is over seven billion years older than both the other interstellar comets and the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The high-quality spectrum of light measured by JWST is key in studying its properties. In particular, the unusually high amount of CO2 in its cometry gas may indicate that it has been bombarded by UV light and high-energy particles,” according to NASA researchers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS allows us a rare chance to study the product of processes of planetesimal formation around another star,” stated researchers from the Universities of Oxford and Canterbury.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects have been observed entering the Solar System, which makes the current discovery particularly noteworthy. Astronomers have suggested that interstellar objects are common in the galaxy, but their small size and high velocity often make them difficult to detect.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS may enhance our understanding of the formation of planetary systems and the composition of materials found in other parts of the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it reappears in November 2025, analyzing its trajectory and composition further. This ongoing study may provide insights into the processes that govern the formation of celestial bodies in our galaxy.</p>
