      <h2>New clues about comet 3I/ATLAS revealed in older images</h2>

<p>A team of researchers from Michigan State University has discovered earlier images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which were captured by NASA’s TESS space telescope in May 2025, before its official detection on July 1, 2025. The findings were announced on September 11, 2025, and provide important insights into the nature of comets from other planetary systems.</p>

<p>This study is significant as it sheds light on the differences between comets originating from other solar systems and those from our own. The researchers aim to use these findings to better understand the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. The peer-reviewed study has been published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will cross the orbit of Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images from TESS were taken in May 2025, prior to the comet's discovery.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>Researchers have noted that 3I/ATLAS exhibits signs of activity much farther from the sun than typical comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 1, 2025, NASA’s TESS space telescope captured images of 3I/ATLAS, which went unnoticed at the time. On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile officially detected the comet. Following this, researchers at Michigan State University identified the earlier images from TESS. On September 11, 2025, the findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There are so few interstellar objects that we’ve detected in our solar system, and they each seem to be unique. 3I/ATLAS gives us an opportunity to study other solar systems up close and personal, without actually needing to visit them,” said lead author Adina Feinstein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Capturing as many observations from this prediscovery period, where 3I/ATLAS may be in telescope images but wasn’t previously identified, is essential to our understanding of how these objects ‘turn on’ as they approach our sun,” said co-author John Noonan.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third interstellar object identified by astronomers. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have helped scientists understand the characteristics and origins of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers plan to continue observing 3I/ATLAS using the James Webb Space Telescope and other instruments to gather more data before the comet moves too far from Earth to be observed effectively.</p>
