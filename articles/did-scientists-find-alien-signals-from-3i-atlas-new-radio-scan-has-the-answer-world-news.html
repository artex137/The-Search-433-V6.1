      <h2>Did scientists find alien signals from 3I/ATLAS? New radio scan has the answer</h2>

<p>Astronomers have conducted a radio scan of the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS as it passed near Earth on December 18, 2023. The object, which originated outside the solar system, has garnered significant attention since its discovery earlier this year. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This research is important as it addresses speculation about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, particularly claims suggesting it could be an artificial object. The findings may help clarify whether the object is indeed a natural comet or something more unusual. In response to the public interest, astronomers have undertaken a targeted search for radio signals that could indicate technological activity associated with 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Date of scan: December 18, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during observations: approximately 267 million km</li>
    <li>Telescope used: Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, West Virginia</li>
    <li>Number of unusual signals detected: nearly 470,000</li>
    <li>Independent searches by two other teams: no credible artificial signals detected</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers have monitored 3I/ATLAS since its discovery earlier this year. As the object approached Earth, researchers heightened their scrutiny, particularly after some scientists suggested it could be artificial. On December 18, 2023, the Breakthrough Listen program conducted a targeted radio scan of the object using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope.</p>
<p>During the scan, the telescope monitored 3I/ATLAS across four radio frequency bands, specifically searching for narrowband signals that might indicate artificial technology. The analysis of the data revealed no credible detections of narrowband radio technosignatures originating from the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have not identified any credible signs of artificial signals from 3I/ATLAS,” the researchers stated, as cited by Gizmodo.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar visitor ever detected, making it a significant subject of study. Previous studies of interstellar objects have led to various theories about their origins and characteristics. Scientists believe 3I/ATLAS is older, larger, and faster than the two previously discovered interstellar objects and exhibits distinct chemical and physical traits.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Although 3I/ATLAS is now leaving the solar system, researchers will continue analyzing the data collected during its passage. The findings are expected to enhance understanding of objects formed around other stars and contribute to the ongoing search for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
