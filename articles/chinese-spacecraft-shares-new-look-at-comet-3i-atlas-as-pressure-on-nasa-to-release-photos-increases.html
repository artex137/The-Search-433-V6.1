      <h2>Chinese spacecraft shares new look at comet 3I/ATLAS as pressure on NASA to release photos increases</h2>

<p>The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has released new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, captured by the Tianwen-1 orbiter between October 1 and 4, 2023. The images include both a still photo and an animated GIF, marking the first time such a distant object has been photographed in this manner.</p>

<p>This development highlights ongoing discussions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which some scientists suggest may not conform to typical comet behavior. The release of these images coincides with increased pressure on NASA to disclose its own photographs of the comet, which could provide further insights into its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Captured by:</strong> Tianwen-1 orbiter, CNSA</li>
    <li><strong>Capture dates:</strong> October 1-4, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 129,800 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> 10,000 to 100,000 times dimmer than Mars</li>
    <li><strong>Other imaging sources:</strong> European Space Agency's Mars Express, ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, NASA's HiRISE camera</li>
    <li><strong>Next steps:</strong> Further studies of 3I/ATLAS based on captured data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023, becoming the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system. On October 2, NASA's HiRISE camera reportedly took a photograph of the comet, though this image has not yet been released to the public.</p>

<p>Between October 1 and 4, the Tianwen-1 orbiter successfully captured images of 3I/ATLAS. The CNSA released these images, which depict distinct features of the comet, including a nucleus and a coma spanning several thousand kilometers.</p>

<p>On November 5, new images of the comet were taken by the R. Naves Observatory in Spain, which have further fueled speculation about the object's nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was the first attempt to photograph such a distant and relatively dim target,” CNSA stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The use of the high-resolution camera carried by the Tianwen-1 orbiter was determined, and key imaging strategies were carefully designed, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the observation,” CNSA added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I write to request the release of specific observational data related to 3I/ATLAS, recently captured by NASA missions,” said Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna in her letter to NASA.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We all owe a debt of deep gratitude for the visionary support displayed by Representative Luna to frontier science through her letter,” noted Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated considerable interest among scientists because of its unusual behavior. Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet's lack of a visible tail could indicate it is not a natural object. This claim is gaining traction as new images emerge.</p>

<p>The ongoing debate surrounding the comet has led to calls for greater transparency from NASA, particularly regarding its imaging data, which could shed light on the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are conducting further studies of 3I/ATLAS based on the observational data captured by the Tianwen-1 orbiter. NASA faces mounting pressure to release its photos of the comet, which could provide critical insights into its characteristics and behavior.</p>
