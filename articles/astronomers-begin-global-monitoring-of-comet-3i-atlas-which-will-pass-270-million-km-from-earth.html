      <h2>Astronomers begin global monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS, which will pass 270 million km from Earth</h2>

<p>Astronomers have initiated global monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to pass approximately 270 million kilometres from Earth in early 2026. The comet has not been associated with any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This monitoring effort is significant as it allows scientists to study the comet's composition and trajectory. Various astronomical agencies around the world, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are collaborating to track the comet's path and gather data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to pass Earth at a distance of 270 million km.</li>
    <li>The monitoring began in January 2026.</li>
    <li>Agencies involved include NASA and the European Space Agency.</li>
    <li>There are currently no reported risks associated with the comet's flyby.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In January 2026, astronomers launched a coordinated effort to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS. This initiative involves telescopes and other observational tools deployed globally to track the comet's trajectory.</p>
<p>The comet's closest approach to Earth is anticipated to occur in early 2026, allowing scientists to gather valuable data about its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS is a unique opportunity for astronomers to enhance our understanding of celestial bodies,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time astronomers have closely monitored a comet. Previous efforts have provided insights into the composition of comets and their potential impact on Earth.</p>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS's trajectory is being closely observed to ensure that any potential risks can be managed effectively.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with ongoing updates expected from participating astronomical agencies.</p>
