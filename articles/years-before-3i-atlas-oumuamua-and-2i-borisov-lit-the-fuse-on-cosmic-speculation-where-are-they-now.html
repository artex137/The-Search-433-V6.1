      <h2>Years before 3I/ATLAS, ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov lit the fuse on cosmic speculation: Where are they now?</h2>

<p>Three confirmed interstellar objects (ISOs)—ʻOumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS—have passed through the Solar System, with the most recent, 3I/ATLAS, detected in July 2025, according to Universe Today. No injuries or fatalities have been reported as a result of these celestial events.</p>

<p>This information is significant as it enhances our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. NASA and researchers from institutions like Harvard University have analyzed the trajectories and characteristics of these ISOs, contributing to the study of cosmic dynamics and stellar populations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>ʻOumuamua detected on October 19, 2017, by the Pan-STARRS1 telescope in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>2I/Borisov discovered by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov on August 30, 2019.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>ʻOumuamua measures approximately 400 meters in length, with a length-to-width ratio of 10:1.</li>
    <li>2I/Borisov's nucleus is estimated to be under one kilometer in diameter.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be 4.6 billion years old.</li>
    <li>All three ISOs follow hyperbolic trajectories and are moving back into interstellar space.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2017, the Pan-STARRS1 telescope in Hawaii first detected ʻOumuamua. It exhibited a unique elongated shape and was classified as inert upon observation. In August 2019, Gennady Borisov discovered 2I/Borisov, which showed signs of active outgassing. In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was detected, displaying cometary activity as it approached the Sun.</p>
<p>Current monitoring continues to focus on the outbound trajectories of these ISOs as they move away from the Sun, following paths determined by their velocities and gravitational influences.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Current data suggests that all three ISOs are now moving back into interstellar space along paths determined by their respective velocities and trajectories,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of interstellar objects has sparked interest in the scientific community regarding their origins and characteristics. Prior to these discoveries, the study of ISOs was largely theoretical. The analysis of their trajectories and compositions has provided valuable insights into the dynamics of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor the outbound trajectories of ʻOumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS to refine models of interstellar object dynamics and stellar population origins. Further studies are expected to enhance our understanding of these cosmic phenomena.</p>
