      <h2>Avi Loeb Claims Comet 3I/ATLAS May Be Alien Spacecraft</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University, has suggested that comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through the Solar System, may be an alien spacecraft. Loeb raised these claims during a recent discussion, highlighting the comet's unusual characteristics, which he argues are improbable for a natural body.</p>

<p>This assertion has garnered significant attention both in scientific circles and among the general public. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are planning detailed observations of the comet as part of their planetary defense protocols. These observations are intended to assess the comet's trajectory and behavior as it nears Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in the Solar System.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has estimated the comet's mass to be around <strong>50 billion tons</strong>.</li>
    <li>The perihelion approach to Earth is expected on <strong>December 19, 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency are coordinating a dedicated observation campaign during the JUICE mission from <strong>November 2 to 25, 2025</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected as an interstellar object, prompting interest in its characteristics. In recent discussions, Avi Loeb has proposed that its unusual mass and behavior suggest it could be a spacecraft. His claims have sparked debate regarding the implications of such an object.</p>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency have begun planning for observations of the comet, scheduled for late 2025, coinciding with its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The characteristics of comet 3I/ATLAS challenge traditional models of the formation of rocky and icy bodies in interstellar space."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"It would be prudent for global institutions to assess scenarios and strategies should its artificial origin be confirmed," Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Avi Loeb has suggested that interstellar objects may have artificial origins. His previous work on 1I/Oumuamua has also generated significant discussion and controversy within the scientific community. The current debate surrounding comet 3I/ATLAS highlights the ongoing interest in the search for extraterrestrial technology and the importance of planetary defense.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency will proceed with their observation plans for comet 3I/ATLAS, with the aim of gathering data to better understand the object and its potential implications for Earth. Further discussions on the comet's characteristics and origins are expected to continue as the approach date nears.</p>
