      <h2>Nuclear Missile Guard Claims Hooded 'Non-Human' Froze Him Before UFO Abduction at Secret US Base</h2>

<p>Richard Barth, a former missile security guard, has claimed he was paralyzed by a hooded non-human figure before being taken aboard a UFO at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in 1964. Barth's allegations have resurfaced, drawing attention to mysterious incidents reported at nuclear weapons sites during the Cold War. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>Barth's account raises questions about unexplained aerial activity near nuclear facilities. Authorities have not disclosed any current investigations related to his claims. The story has reignited discussions on the connection between UFO sightings and military installations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in 1964 during Barth's night shift at Vandenberg Air Force Base.</li>
    <li>Barth reported losing control of his body and experiencing a lapse in time.</li>
    <li>He described four entities with large heads and dark eyes communicating telepathically.</li>
    <li>Barth claimed to have witnessed a glowing yellow orb during a missile launch.</li>
    <li>The base was reportedly shrouded in thick fog at the time of the encounter.</li>
    <li>No official military records confirm Barth's alleged abduction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1964, Richard Barth was stationed as a missile security guard at Vandenberg Air Force Base. During a night shift, he noticed a shadow in the fog, initially believing it to be a fellow serviceman. As the figure approached, Barth realized it was not human and felt frozen.</p>

<p>Barth reported losing control of his body and subsequently experienced a lapse in time. His next memory involved waking aboard a UFO, surrounded by four entities. He claimed these beings communicated telepathically and warned him about the dangers of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Barth also recalled witnessing a glowing yellow orb tracking a missile during an earlier launch, an event he was allegedly warned never to discuss.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I kept the story private for decades due to fear of ridicule and potential repercussions within the military,” Barth said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Barth's claims have gained traction partly due to other unusual reports from Vandenberg Air Force Base during 1964. In September of that year, another serviceman reportedly captured footage of a mysterious object interacting with an Atlas missile during a test launch. Researchers note that these recurring stories suggest a pattern of unexplained aerial activity linked to advanced weapons testing.</p>

<p>Experts remain skeptical of Barth's account, attributing extraordinary experiences to stress or memory gaps. However, supporters argue that the consistency of accounts from multiple veterans merits further investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No investigations or charges have been announced related to Barth's claims. The discussion surrounding UFO sightings near military sites continues, with advocates calling for a thorough examination of the incidents.</p>
