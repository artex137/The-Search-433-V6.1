      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will pass closest to Earth early Friday morning</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, at approximately 2:30 a.m. to 5 a.m. EST, reaching a distance of about 168 million miles. The comet, which was first discovered in July by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the comet's interstellar origins, which provide a rare opportunity for scientists to study material from outside our solar system. NASA scientists have noted that the comet travels at an unprecedented speed of around 130,000 miles per hour, making it the fastest recorded visitor to our solar system. Observers will require a telescope or powerful binoculars to view the comet, as it will not be visible to the naked eye. Space.com will livestream the event on December 18-19 starting at 10 p.m. CT.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>It will reach a distance of approximately 168 million miles.</li>
    <li>The closest viewing time is expected between 2:30 a.m. and 5 a.m. EST.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at around 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by ATLAS in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Observers will need a telescope or binoculars to see the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 during a routine sky survey by ATLAS. It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2023, at a distance of approximately 130 million miles. The comet is expected to continue its journey through interstellar space after its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope gathered data on the comet's size and composition shortly after its discovery. The comet's nucleus is estimated to be between 1,000 feet and 3.5 miles in diameter. Experts have noted the challenges in determining its origins due to its rapid movement through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“[Interstellar objects are] like cosmic time capsules, delivering samples from distant exoplanetary systems we could never otherwise visit and study directly,” Space.com stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, a lead scientist for NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates it is moving too fast to be captured by the Sun's gravitational pull. The comet's unique chemical makeup suggests it formed in a different environment than our solar system.</p>

<p>Speculation regarding the comet's nature has arisen, particularly from Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who has suggested it may be alien technology. However, this theory has been met with skepticism from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach, Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue its trajectory through interstellar space. Scientists will analyze data collected during its pass to further understand its composition and origins.</p>
