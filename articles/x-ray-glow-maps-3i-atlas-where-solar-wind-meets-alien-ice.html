      <h2>X-ray glow maps 3I/ATLAS where solar wind meets alien ice</h2>

<p>Scientists have mapped the X-ray glow emitted from comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing interactions between solar wind and the comet's icy surface. This discovery was made by researchers using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and has provided insights into the behavior of solar wind as it reaches extraterrestrial bodies.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances the understanding of how solar wind impacts comets and other celestial objects. The findings could inform future studies on the composition of comets and their potential effects on space weather. NASA and other space agencies are expected to further investigate these interactions to deepen their knowledge of solar phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory.</li>
<li>The X-ray glow was detected as solar wind interacts with the comet's ice.</li>
<li>This study contributes to understanding the solar wind's effects on comets.</li>
<li>The research was published in a recent scientific report.</li>
<li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this study.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has been monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS since its discovery. The mapping of the X-ray glow has occurred over several observation sessions, with findings being compiled into a scientific report released recently. Specific dates for the observations have not been disclosed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This discovery sheds light on the complex interactions between solar wind and cometary ice,” said a spokesperson for NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time that researchers have studied the effects of solar wind on comets. Previous studies have indicated that solar wind can significantly alter the behavior and appearance of these celestial objects. Understanding these interactions is crucial for predicting space weather events that could impact Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to conduct further observations of comet 3I/ATLAS to expand on these findings. Future studies may focus on the implications of this research for space weather forecasting and our understanding of the solar system's dynamics.</p>
