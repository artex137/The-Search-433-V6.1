      <h2>Matthew Brown – holding past presidents accountable for UAP secrecy</h2>

<p>Former Pentagon metadata analyst Matthew Brown has gained attention this year for his criticisms of U.S. government secrecy regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Brown's advocacy has centered around a deep dive into the Pentagon's UFO program, culminating in the publication of the “Immaculate Constellation” file, which has attracted significant support from the online community, particularly on Reddit.</p>

<p>This issue matters as it raises questions about government transparency and accountability. Brown argues that successive U.S. presidents have perpetuated a culture of secrecy regarding UFOs, fearing that disclosure could alienate voters. His recent writings and public statements have sparked renewed discussions about the implications of UAP secrecy and the need for reform.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Matthew Brown has published the “Immaculate Constellation” file.</li>
    <li>Brown's blog, Invisible Frontiers, gained traction during August and September 2023.</li>
    <li>He claims that U.S. presidents from Truman to Trump have continued a culture of secrecy regarding UFOs.</li>
    <li>Brown has collaborated with ufologists, including Jeremy Corbell.</li>
    <li>Former President Barack Obama acknowledged the existence of unexplained aerial phenomena in 2021.</li>
    <li>Brown has called for an investigation into the secrecy surrounding UAP.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, Matthew Brown has extensively criticized government secrecy regarding UAP through his writings and social media. His blog, Invisible Frontiers, has explored the implications of UFO secrecy and the historical context of U.S. presidential policies.</p>

<p>Brown's publication of the “Immaculate Constellation” file has drawn attention to the issues of accountability and transparency in government dealings with UAP. He has also highlighted the historical context of UFO secrecy, tracing it back to President Truman's administration.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every step of the process was anomalous and not in keeping with official procedures. This was partly by design – my decision to self-report offered an opportunity to learn more about UAP through ‘the process’ itself.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The challenge before us is formidable. Corruption is pervasive, toxic, and entrenched at the top.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>U.S. government secrecy regarding UFOs has a long history, with claims that President Truman initiated a cover-up following the 1947 Roswell incident. Subsequent presidents have been accused of maintaining this secrecy, with some analysts suggesting that political motivations play a significant role in the continued concealment of UAP information.</p>

<p>In 2021, Barack Obama acknowledged the existence of footage and records of aerial objects that remain unexplained, indicating that the issue has received some attention at high levels of government.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Matthew Brown has indicated plans to speak about his “Immaculate Constellation” report at an undecided time. He continues to advocate for an investigation into the constitutional implications of UAP secrecy, emphasizing the need for accountability in government practices.</p>
