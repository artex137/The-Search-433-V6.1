      <h2>Baba Vanga's Alien Prediction and Trump's UFO Disclosure</h2>

<p>A prophecy by Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga has gained attention following President Donald Trump's order to release secret government files on UFOs and extraterrestrial life. The announcement, made recently, has intensified speculation about the implications of the newly disclosed records on unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it coincides with claims that Baba Vanga predicted humans would first contact aliens in November 2026. Authorities have not disclosed specific details regarding the content of the released files or any potential findings related to UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Trump orders release of UFO-related government files</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Recently announced; exact date not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Predicted Contact:</strong> November 2026, according to Baba Vanga</li>
    <li><strong>Baba Vanga:</strong> Born Vangeliya Pandeva Dimitrova in 1911; died August 11, 1996</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Predictions:</strong> Believers credit her with predicting major global events</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Baba Vanga, known for her prophecies, reportedly foresaw that a massive spacecraft would enter Earth's atmosphere in November 2026, indicating undeniable proof of extraterrestrial life. Her followers claim she had visions about future contact with aliens in 2288 and the construction of underwater cities with their help.</p>

<p>In recent months, speculation regarding UFOs intensified after former President Barack Obama acknowledged the existence of aliens during a February 14 interview. Trump criticized these remarks, asserting that Obama revealed classified information. Following this, Trump directed the Pentagon to release materials related to UAP and UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Two metal birds will crash into American brothers, and blood will spill,” Baba Vanga reportedly predicted regarding the September 11 attacks.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Baba Vanga has been credited with predicting several significant events, including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the election of Barack Obama in 2008. However, some of her predictions have not materialized, leading to debate among skeptics and believers regarding their accuracy.</p>

<p>As public interest in UFOs grows, the release of government files may further fuel discussions about Vanga's predictions and the broader implications of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The government is expected to continue releasing information related to UFOs, as interest in the subject increases. Future investigations may focus on the implications of these files and any connections to ongoing claims about alien life.</p>
