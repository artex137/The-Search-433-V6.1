      <h2>New Image of Comet 3I/ATLAS Captured by Juice Spacecraft</h2>

<p>A new image of comet 3I/ATLAS has been captured by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) spacecraft on 2 November 2025. The comet, which is an interstellar object, was discovered on 1 July 2025 and is currently passing through our Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar comets. Scientists are utilizing various telescopes and spacecraft to gather information about the comet before it disappears from view. The data collected could provide insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The Juice spacecraft captured an image of the comet on 2 November 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of Juice to 3I/ATLAS occurred on 4 November 2025 at a distance of 66 million km (41 million miles).</li>
    <li>The full data from Juice's observations is expected to arrive on Earth in February 2026.</li>
    <li>Juice's image shows the comet's coma and two tails, one made of gas and the other of dust.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, scientists discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. By autumn 2025, the comet moved behind the Sun from Earth's perspective, prompting scientists to utilize various spacecraft for observations. On 2 November 2025, the Juice spacecraft captured an image of the comet during its first observation session. The closest approach of Juice to 3I/ATLAS occurred on 4 November 2025.</p>

<p>Following the observations, ESA indicated that data from five scientific instruments on Juice would be sent back to Earth in February 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We expect to receive the data from the five scientific instruments switched on during the observations – JANUS, MAJIS, UVS, SWI and PEP – on 18 and 20 February 2026,” ESA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is unique as it originates from beyond our Solar System, making it potentially the oldest comet ever discovered at approximately 7 billion years old. The majority of comets known to scientists originate from within our Solar System.</p>

<p>The Juice mission is primarily focused on studying Jupiter's icy moons, which are believed to have subsurface oceans, making them potential locations for signs of habitability.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Juice mission team will analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS once it arrives in February 2026, including high-resolution images and composition data.</p>
