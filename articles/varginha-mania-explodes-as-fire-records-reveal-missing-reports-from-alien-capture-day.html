      <h2>Varginha Mania Explodes as Fire Records Reveal Missing Reports From Alien Capture Day</h2>

<p>On 20 January 1996, the Brazilian town of Varginha became the focus of an alleged UFO incident when three girls reported seeing a creature. Newly-released fire department documents show serious gaps and alterations in the official record from that day, raising questions about the events surrounding the capture of the so-called Varginha creature.</p>

<p>These discrepancies in the fire department logs have prompted renewed interest in the incident, with UFO researchers seeking to understand the implications of the missing records. Authorities have not disclosed any current investigations into the fire department's documentation practices or the missing police reports.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: 20 January 1996</li>
    <li>Location: Varginha, Brazil</li>
    <li>Number of eyewitnesses: Three girls</li>
    <li>Reported creature characteristics: Dark brown, shiny, oily with large red eyes</li>
    <li>Medical description of creature: White skin, lavender eyes</li>
    <li>Number of fire department incidents logged that day: Nine</li>
    <li>Time of first recorded incident: Around 10:00 AM</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the morning of 20 January 1996, three girls reported seeing a strange creature in Varginha. The fire department logs indicate that only one incident was recorded during the morning, a medical emergency, which seems inconsistent with the events reported by the eyewitnesses. A bulletin was noted at 10:00 AM, but subsequent entries were not logged until later that evening.</p>

<p>As the day progressed, doctors admitted a creature to the hospital, which eyewitnesses described differently from earlier reports. The discrepancies in the creature's appearance have led to speculation about possible biological responses to environmental factors.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The incident reports weren't digitised. Everything was done by hand. If there was an error in one number, sometimes several had to be corrected,” said the former commander of the Varginha Fire Department.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Errors in manual record-keeping are common. The missing reports and discrepancies do not provide definitive evidence of extraordinary events,” stated skeptic ufologist João Marcelo.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Varginha incident has remained a topic of fascination for decades, with ongoing interest from UFO enthusiasts and researchers. Documentaries, including Rede Globo's 'The Mystery of Varginha,' have highlighted the inconsistencies in the official reports and the potential implications of the alleged extraterrestrial encounter.</p>

<p>The recent release of fire department files has reignited discussions about the physiological anomalies of the creature and the missing police records. These factors continue to fuel debate within the UFO community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not announced any investigations into the discrepancies in the fire department's documentation or the missing police records. Future inquiries may focus on understanding the events of 20 January 1996 and the implications of the newly-released information.</p>
