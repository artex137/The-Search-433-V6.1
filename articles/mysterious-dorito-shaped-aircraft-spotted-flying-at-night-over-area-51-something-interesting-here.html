      <h2>Mysterious ‘Dorito-shaped’ aircraft spotted flying at night over Area 51</h2>

<p>A “Dorito-shaped” aircraft has been spotted flying over Area 51, a highly classified military base in southern Nevada, around 3 a.m. on January 14. Off-grid videographer Anders Otteson recorded the unidentified aircraft while documenting the area for his YouTube channel, Uncanny Expeditions.</p>

<p>This sighting has raised interest among UFO researchers and the public. Authorities are currently examining the footage and looking into the implications of the sighting, as it follows a pattern of similar unidentified aerial phenomena reported in the region.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Time of sighting: 3 a.m. on January 14</li>
    <li>Location: Area 51, southern Nevada</li>
    <li>Videographer: Anders Otteson</li>
    <li>Aircraft shape: Equilateral triangle, described as “Dorito-shaped”</li>
    <li>Previous sightings: Over 40 triangular unidentified aerial phenomena reported in Nevada in 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 14, 2026, Anders Otteson captured video footage of an unidentified aircraft near Area 51. He noted its distinct shape, which differed from that of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber he filmed earlier that night. The following day, Otteson collaborated with UFO researcher Joerg Arnu, who provided audio of unusual radio communications from pilots during a B-2 flight in the area.</p>

<p>Otteson mentioned that the aircraft’s shape and flight trail resembled those seen in photos from 2014, which depicted similar unidentified triangle-shaped aircraft over Wichita, Kansas, and Amarillo, Texas.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Are we looking at a classified test flight or run-of-the-mill training sortie? I certainly think we have something interesting here,” Otteson said regarding the aircraft.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Joerg Arnu described the radio chatter as “different than anything” he had previously heard after decades of monitoring the airwaves.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has been a focal point for UFO lore for decades. The U.S. government acknowledged the base's existence in 2013. In April 2025, a triangular tower at the base fueled speculation about potential links to alien technology. The structure is reported to stand between 150 and 190 feet tall, but its purpose remains unclear.</p>

<p>In 2025, Nevada logged over 40 reported sightings of triangular unidentified aerial phenomena, indicating a growing interest and concern regarding unexplained aerial activities in the area.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the recent sighting are ongoing. Authorities may review the footage and audio recordings to determine the nature of the aircraft and whether it poses any security concerns.</p>
