      <h2>NASA’s Jupiter Probe Could Snag First-Ever Sample From an Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>NASA’s Europa Clipper probe may have the opportunity to collect material from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the inner solar system between October 30 and November 6. Scientists have identified a chance for the probe to pass through the comet’s ion tail, which has been growing since the comet's discovery in early June. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This potential encounter is significant as it would mark the first time a spacecraft could directly sample material from an interstellar object. Researchers aim to gather data on the interior of interstellar comets and the star systems from which they originate. The Europa Clipper is currently en route to study Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, and is equipped with tools that may aid in this analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in early June 2023.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, occurs on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The Europa Clipper probe is expected to encounter the ion tail between October 30 and November 6, 2023.</li>
    <li>Researchers Samuel Gran and Geraint Jones have conducted the analysis using the “Tailcatcher” computer program.</li>
    <li>Instruments necessary for sampling are currently inactive amid a government shutdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early June 2023, and since then, its tail has expanded as it approaches the Sun. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun, or perihelion, on October 29, 2023. Researchers have predicted that the Europa Clipper could intercept the ion tail between October 30 and November 6, 2023, providing a unique opportunity for scientific discovery.</p>

<p>The Europa Clipper is currently en route to Jupiter and is equipped with instruments that could analyze the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS. However, the instruments are inactive due to a government shutdown, raising concerns about the timing of their activation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have virtually no data on the interior of interstellar comets and the star systems that formed them,” said Samuel Gran, a postdoctoral researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Sampling the tail in this way is the closest we can currently get to a direct sample of such an object, and thus a different part of the galaxy,” Gran added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets is a relatively new field, with 3I/ATLAS being one of the few known examples. Prior to this, most comet studies have focused on objects within our solar system. The ability to analyze materials from 3I/ATLAS could enhance understanding of the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and the status of the Europa Clipper's instruments. Activation of the necessary tools will be crucial for the potential sampling of the comet’s ion tail. The scientific community awaits further developments as the encounter window approaches.</p>
