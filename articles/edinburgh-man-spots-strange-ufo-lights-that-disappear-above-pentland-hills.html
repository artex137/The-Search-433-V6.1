      <h2>Edinburgh man spots strange 'UFO lights' above Pentland Hills</h2>

<p>An Edinburgh resident has shared a video of strange lights hovering above the Pentland Hills, captured from his flat window in the Forrester area around 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, January 8. The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, reported seeing four to five lights that merged into a single ball of light before disappearing.</p>

<p>This sighting has drawn attention due to the ongoing interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities have not confirmed the nature of the lights. The incident raises questions about potential military exercises or other explanations for the unusual lights.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on January 8 at approximately 7:30 p.m.</li>
    <li>Location: Above the Allermuir Hill region of the Pentland Hills.</li>
    <li>The man has recorded a video of the lights from his flat window.</li>
    <li>Witness reported seeing four to five lights that merged into one.</li>
    <li>Emergency services involvement: not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Previous sightings: A woman in West Lothian reported a similar incident.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The resident captured the video from his flat while eating dinner. He noticed the lights and quickly grabbed his phone to record the event. The lights appeared as a horizontal line, then merged into a single stationary light for approximately 10-15 minutes before disappearing.</p>

<p>The witness expressed uncertainty about whether the lights were related to a military exercise or if there was another explanation. He noted that his views on UFOs have changed since the release of declassified UAP videos by the Pentagon in 2020.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It was a horizontal line of four or five lights, then at the end of the video it looked like one ball of light that stayed stationery for a good 10-15 minutes,” the witness said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I don’t think it was aircraft or drones because the lights just appeared and disappeared like switching off a light,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a growing interest in UFO sightings, particularly following the release of UAP footage by the Pentagon. The witness indicated that he has seen strange lights in the Pentland Hills area before, suggesting a pattern of sightings in the region.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not announced any investigations into the sighting. Further reports of similar phenomena may prompt local or national agencies to look into the matter.</p>
