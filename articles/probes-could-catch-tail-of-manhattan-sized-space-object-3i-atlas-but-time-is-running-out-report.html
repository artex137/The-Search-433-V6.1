      <h2>Probes could catch tail of Manhattan-sized space object 3I/ATLAS, but time is running out: report</h2>

<p>A pair of space probes, Hera and Europa Clipper, may be able to pass through the tail of the comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth over the next few weeks. Scientists have indicated that immediate course adjustments are necessary for the probes to intercept the comet's tail, according to a new paper published in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society.</p>

<p>This opportunity is significant for researchers, as it marks the first time scientists could collect data directly from a comet's tail. The probes will be flying "downwind" of 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to reach its closest point to Earth by the end of October. However, the comet will be obscured by the Sun, making observations from Earth impossible.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Probes: Hera and Europa Clipper</li>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach: End of October 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from comet for probe interception: Approximately 5 million miles</li>
    <li>Publication: Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society</li>
    <li>Timeframe for course adjustments: Next two weeks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in June 2023. Since its discovery, it has intrigued scientists due to its unusual behavior and composition. The comet is expected to pass closest to Earth by late October 2023. The Hera and Europa Clipper probes are currently on separate missions but may have the chance to analyze the comet's tail in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Hera may not even be able to be of much help. The probe is currently headed to study an asteroid and isn’t equipped with instruments that could do much reading of 3I/ATLAS’ particles,” according to the report.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Europa Clipper — which is on the way to analyze ice on Jupiter’s moon Europa — has exactly the kind of instruments the job would call for,” the report states.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has puzzled scientists since its discovery, with some, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, suggesting it could be an intelligently-operated alien probe. The object has been observed ejecting a nickel alloy typically associated with human manufacturing and has previously emitted an "anti-tail," which Loeb speculated might indicate a braking thrust system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists must act quickly to adjust the course of the probes within the next two weeks to capitalize on this rare opportunity to collect data from 3I/ATLAS. Further observations and analysis will depend on the probes' successful interception of the comet's tail.</p>
