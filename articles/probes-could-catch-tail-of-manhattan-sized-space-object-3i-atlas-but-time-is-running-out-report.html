      <h2>Probes could catch tail of Manhattan-sized space object 3I/ATLAS, but time is running out: report</h2>

<p>A pair of space probes, Hera and Europa Clipper, may have the opportunity to pass through the tail of the comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, according to a report published in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society. This event is expected to occur over the next few weeks as the comet travels through the solar system.</p>

<p>This potential encounter is significant because it presents a rare chance for scientists to collect data from the comet's tail, which contains particles ejected by the comet. The probes will need to be redirected quickly to take advantage of this opportunity, as their current missions do not involve studying 3I/ATLAS directly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The probes Hera and Europa Clipper are currently on separate missions in the solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first observed in June 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to fly closest to Earth by the end of October 2025.</li>
    <li>The dispersal field of particles is located approximately 8 million kilometers (5 million miles) from the comet.</li>
    <li>Scientists have a two-week window to redirect the probes for optimal data collection.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper is equipped with instruments suitable for analyzing the comet's particles.</li>
    <li>Hera is currently focused on studying an asteroid and may not be able to assist effectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in June 2025. In the following months, scientists have observed its unusual behavior and composition, leading to speculation about its origins. As the comet approaches Earth, researchers have identified a unique opportunity for the Hera and Europa Clipper probes to collect data from its tail.</p>
<p>In late October 2025, the comet will be at its closest point to Earth, but it will be obscured by the Sun, making it difficult for ground-based telescopes to observe it.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Both probes will be flying ‘downwind’ of 3I/ATLAS as it cruises through the cosmic neighborhood,” according to Live Science.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Scientists would need to act immediately to send them on course to meet the comet’s tail,” the report stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have sparked interest and debate within the scientific community. Some researchers, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have suggested that its composition and behavior may indicate it is not simply a natural comet. The presence of a nickel alloy and the emission of an “anti-tail” have raised questions about its origins and function.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists must make quick decisions regarding the course adjustments for the probes within the next two weeks to capitalize on this rare opportunity to study 3I/ATLAS.</p>
