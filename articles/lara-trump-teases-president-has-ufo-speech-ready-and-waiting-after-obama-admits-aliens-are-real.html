      <h2>Lara Trump Teases President Has UFO ‘Speech’ Ready and Waiting After Obama Admits Aliens Are ‘Real’</h2>

<p>Lara Trump has stated that her father-in-law, President Donald Trump, has a speech prepared regarding extraterrestrial life, which he will deliver at the "right time." She shared this information during a podcast interview with New York Post reporter Miranda Devine on Wednesday, shortly after former President Barack Obama claimed that UFOs are "real." No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this topic.</p>

<p>This revelation comes amid increasing public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life, following Obama’s comments that have sparked widespread discussion. Authorities and experts have been examining UFO phenomena more closely, with recent testimonies from former military personnel adding to the conversation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interview took place on Wednesday, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Obama's UFO comments occurred less than a week prior to Lara Trump's statements.</li>
    <li>Retired Maj. David Grusch testified to the House Oversight Committee in 2023 regarding government UFO programs.</li>
    <li>Grusch alleged the U.S. has retrieved “non-human” biological matter from UFO pilots.</li>
    <li>Location of Obama’s comments: podcast hosted by Brian Tyler Cohen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a podcast interview on Wednesday, Lara Trump revealed that President Trump has a prepared speech on extraterrestrial life. This follows Obama’s remarks made on a podcast less than a week earlier, where he confirmed the existence of UFOs. Obama stated that while he has not personally seen any extraterrestrial beings, they are not merely fictional characters.</p>

<p>Earlier in 2023, retired Maj. David Grusch testified before the House Oversight Committee, claiming he had been denied access to certain government UFO programs, yet knows the “exact locations” of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) in U.S. possession.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Do you think he's about to make an announcement on UFOs? Because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president,” Lara Trump said during the interview.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I think my father-in-law actually said it — that there is some speech that I guess at the right time... he’s gonna break out and talk about,” she added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I feel like there might be information out there, and hopefully it’s going to be able to be told to us very soon,” Lara Trump stated, expressing her anticipation for further revelations on the topic.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion of UFOs and extraterrestrial life has gained traction in recent years, particularly following testimonies from military personnel and public figures. In addition to Obama and Lara Trump, other politicians have expressed beliefs in the existence of extraterrestrial beings, contributing to a growing narrative surrounding UFOs. Retired Maj. David Grusch’s testimony has also amplified calls for transparency regarding government knowledge of UFOs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UFOs continues to escalate, it remains unclear when President Trump will deliver his anticipated speech. Investigations into UFO phenomena and public discussions surrounding the topic are expected to persist, as authorities and experts seek to uncover more information.</p>
