      <h2>Awakening an interstellar wanderer: Surprising nickel detection in Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A team of international astronomers has detected glowing nickel vapor in the gas surrounding interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first spotted on July 1, 2025, during a routine sky survey by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). This unexpected finding occurred at a distance of 3.88 astronomical units (AU) from the sun, where temperatures are too cold for metals to typically vaporize.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides new insights into the chemical composition of materials from beyond our solar system, potentially billions of years old. The findings may help scientists understand the origins of planetary systems and the chemical processes at play in interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nickel vapor was first detected on July 20, 2025, at a distance of 3.88 AU from the sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The team includes scientists from Chile, Belgium, the U.K., Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and Italy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected comet 3I/ATLAS during a routine survey. This marked the discovery of only the third confirmed interstellar object. Observations began immediately, providing a unique opportunity to study its approach to the sun.</p>

<p>By July 20, the team recorded spectral lines indicating the presence of nickel vapor in the comet's atmosphere. This detection was notable given the cold temperatures at that distance from the sun. As the comet continued its journey, an increase in nickel vapor was observed.</p>

<p>On August 15, 2025, at approximately 3.07 AU from the sun, scientists detected spectral signatures of cyanogen (CN) gas, marking a significant observation in the comet's chemical activation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I/ATLAS opens the door to a completely new branch of study in astrophysics,” said Rohan Rahatgaonkar, a Ph.D. student at the Instituto de Astrofísica-Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The beauty of science lies in following the evidence where it leads us, even when findings challenge our expectations,” said Darryl Z. Seligman, Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan State University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and comet Borisov. Its early detection offers a rare chance to track the evolution of an interstellar comet as it approaches the sun, providing insights into the chemical signatures that may reflect its ancient origins.</p>

<p>Previous studies of interstellar objects have shown they carry chemical information from their star systems, allowing for comparisons between different stellar environments and the building blocks of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its approach to perihelion, scientists will gather more data on its chemical composition. Observations are expected to reveal further increases in activity and potentially new chemical species as temperatures rise.</p>
