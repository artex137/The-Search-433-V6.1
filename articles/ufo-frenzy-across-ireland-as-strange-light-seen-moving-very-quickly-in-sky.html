      <h2>UFO frenzy across Ireland as 'strange light' seen moving very quickly in sky</h2>

<p>A bright, puzzling light has been reported across Ireland since 6 p.m. local time, leading to widespread speculation about unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Witnesses described the light as “like a big object with light in front but no noise and moving very quickly.” No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The sighting has sparked a wave of interest and theories about UFOs nationwide. Alan O'Reilly from Carlow Weather stated he received numerous messages from people across the country who captured videos and images of the light. He noted that initial investigations suggested the light was not associated with any aircraft tracked on FlightRadar. However, it has since been identified as the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket dumping fuel in orbit after its launch in Florida earlier that day.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Time of sighting: After 6 p.m. local time</li>
  <li>Location: Reports came from across Ireland, including the south, midlands, and both east and west regions</li>
  <li>Reported by: Alan O'Reilly, Carlow Weather</li>
  <li>No injuries or fatalities reported</li>
  <li>Initial speculation involved UFOs and alien sightings</li>
  <li>Identified as the Falcon 9 rocket dumping fuel in orbit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The strange light was first reported by witnesses around 6 p.m. local time, with many people sharing videos and images on social media. Alan O'Reilly reported a surge in messages from the public, indicating widespread sightings across Ireland.</p>

<p>As the evening progressed, O'Reilly stated that initial tracking of the object did not yield any results. By the end of the night, the light was identified as the Falcon 9 rocket’s fuel dump, clarifying the mystery behind the sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“So I don't know what that light in the sky was that I've shared. My notifications have never lit up like they have just now,” said Alan O'Reilly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The light in the sky tonight most likely to be the Falcon 9 dumping fuel in orbit based on latest information. Not aliens this time,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a trend of increased public interest in UFO sightings, especially with the rise of social media where users can share experiences in real time. Previous incidents in Ireland have also sparked similar reactions, although most have been attributed to natural or man-made phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
