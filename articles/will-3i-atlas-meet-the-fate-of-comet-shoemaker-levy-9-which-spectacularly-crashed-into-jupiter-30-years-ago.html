      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS to Fly by Jupiter in 2026</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to fly by Jupiter on March 16, 2026, at a distance of 33 million miles, according to reports from Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The comet's trajectory has sparked comparisons to the historic impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which collided with Jupiter in July 1994.</p>

<p>This upcoming event is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential origins. Scientists are particularly interested in whether the comet could be an artificial object and if it might deploy devices within Jupiter's Hill sphere during its flyby.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The flyby distance will be approximately 33 million miles.</li>
    <li>The comet previously passed Earth at a distance of 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at a speed of 65.9 kilometers per second relative to Jupiter.</li>
    <li>The escape speed from Jupiter's gravitational potential well is 2.2 kilometers per second.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered recently and has generated significant interest. It is expected to fly past Earth before its approach to Jupiter. The flyby will occur nearly two years after its initial discovery.</p>
<p>In contrast, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was discovered in 1993 and fragmented due to Jupiter's tidal forces in 1992. The impacts on Jupiter occurred from July 16 to July 22, 1994.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist, speculated, “If 3I/ATLAS is technological in origin, it might have fine-tuned its trajectory with the help of thrusters.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb further stated, “Any new objects orbiting Jupiter after the passage of 3I/ATLAS could be identified by the Juno spacecraft.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter was the first recorded extraterrestrial impact on a solar system planet. It produced visible impacts that lasted for months and raised awareness about the potential dangers of comets and asteroids.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS, classified as an interstellar comet, has prompted discussions among scientists regarding its origins and possible technological attributes, differentiating it from typical comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the 2026 flyby approaches, scientists will continue to analyze 3I/ATLAS's trajectory and gather more data. Observations will be conducted to determine if any devices are deployed during the comet's passage near Jupiter.</p>
