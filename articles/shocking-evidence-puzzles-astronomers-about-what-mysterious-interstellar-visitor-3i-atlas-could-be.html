      <h2>Shocking evidence puzzles astronomers about what mysterious interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS could be</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has raised eyebrows among astronomers after it survived a close flyby of the sun on October 29, 2025, without disintegrating. Initial expectations suggested the object would break apart, but recent observations have revealed it remains intact, challenging conventional comet theories.</p>

<p>This development matters because it could indicate that 3I/ATLAS is not a comet but potentially an alien spacecraft. Researchers are now analyzing new data to understand the object's unusual characteristics, including jets of material that defy typical comet behavior. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the jets could point to a technological origin, while others in the scientific community remain skeptical.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km) in diameter.</li>
    <li>The object passed closest to the sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is expected to approach Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is ejecting about five billion tons of material each month.</li>
    <li>The jets extend up to 620,000 miles (998,000 km) toward the sun and 1.86 million miles (2.99 million km) in the opposite direction.</li>
    <li>Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has stated that some information about 3I/ATLAS is being withheld by the Pentagon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, sparking interest due to its interstellar origin. It made its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025, where scientists expected it to break apart. Observations from the Nordic Optical Telescope in Spain on November 9 revealed that it remained intact, prompting further investigation into its unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>Following the flyby, astronomers noted the presence of an 'anti-tail' and jets of material that challenge the conventional understanding of comet behavior. These findings have led to increased scrutiny and debate within the scientific community regarding the object's true nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Technological thrusters which point their exhaust towards the sun would accelerate away from the sun,” Loeb said. “This post-perihelion maneuver might be employed by a spacecraft that aims to gain speed rather than slow down through the gravitational assist from the sun.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I do believe it's a passing through comet, and so I don't think we are going to have any contact with any non-human intelligence yet,” Luna told NewsMax. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The theories that the object contains alien life or will collide with Earth are not true,” said NASA administrator Sean Duffy.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is not the first celestial object to spark speculation about extraterrestrial life. Previous interstellar visitors have also prompted discussions about their origins, though none have exhibited the same level of unusual characteristics as 3I/ATLAS. The scientific community has historically maintained that such objects are natural phenomena, but the latest findings have reignited debates on the possibility of technological origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth on December 19. Congresswoman Luna has called on NASA to release all collected images and data regarding the object's journey, while debates about its classification and nature are expected to persist in the scientific community.</p>
