      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals signs of metal, carbon, and possible cryovolcanism</h2>

<p>New analyses of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have shown that this rare celestial body is carbon-rich and metal-bearing, with a bright coma dominated by carbon dioxide. The comet, which has exhibited signs of complex chemistry potentially linked to catalytic and cryovolcanic processes, was first detected by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it provides insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Astronomers have initiated an international observation campaign to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the inner Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>It travels at approximately 57 km/s (35 mi/s) relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus size is estimated between 0.3–5.6 km (0.19–3.4 miles) in diameter.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide dominates its coma, with a CO<sub>2</sub>-to-H<sub>2</sub>O ratio seven times higher than typical comets.</li>
    <li>Nickel detected in its coma exceeds levels found in previous comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope detected comet 3I/ATLAS, marking the beginning of an international observation campaign. Data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission revealed that the comet had not approached any nearby stars in at least 10 million years. As the comet approached a heliocentric distance of 2.53 AU, astronomers noted a significant increase in its brightness and surface activity between July and October 2025. The comet reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The presence of nickel in 3I/ATLAS's coma suggests a deeper and more energetic process at work," said a lead researcher. "This finding could alter our understanding of interstellar bodies."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar comets, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unique characteristics, including a bright coma and high metal content, set it apart from typical Solar System comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System, focusing on its chemical composition and surface activity. Further studies may provide insights into the formation of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>
