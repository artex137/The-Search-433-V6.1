      <h2>Donut-shaped flying objects reported near Thurston County in 1947</h2>

<p>On June 21, 1947, Harold Dahl and Fred Crisman reported seeing six circular, donut-shaped flying objects over Maury Island, located north of Tacoma, Washington. Dahl claimed that one of the crafts ejected metal debris that injured his son and killed his dog. No fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident, known as the “Maury Island Incident,” has been a topic of interest for decades. Authorities, including the FBI, initially suspected the report was a hoax. However, the event has contributed to ongoing public fascination with UFOs and has inspired cultural phenomena such as the "Men in Black" movies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: June 21, 1947</li>
    <li>Location: Maury Island, Washington</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Harold Dahl and Fred Crisman</li>
    <li>Injuries: One son injured, one dog killed</li>
    <li>FBI classification: Suspected hoax</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 21, 1947, Harold Dahl and Fred Crisman reported seeing six donut-shaped flying objects over Puget Sound. Dahl stated that one object dropped metal debris, resulting in injuries to his son and the death of his dog. The incident drew attention and was investigated by the FBI.</p>

<p>On June 24, 1947, respected businessman Kenneth Arnold observed nine shiny, metallic saucer-like UFOs while searching for a downed U.S. Marine Transport near Mount Rainier. His sighting, which he described as "like a saucer if you skip it across water," led to the media coining the term “flying saucer.”</p>

<p>Following these sightings, the U.S. military investigated the reports, attributing some to Soviet aircraft while acknowledging the credibility of others. Arnold maintained the accuracy of his sighting until his death in 1984.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Diverse other credible persons saw the same light, after, about the same place,” said John Winthrop, referring to earlier sightings in 1639.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The objects flipped, banked and weaved through the sky,” Arnold stated about his own sighting on June 24, 1947.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Maury Island Incident is part of a larger pattern of UFO sightings that surged during the late 1940s and early 1950s. This period coincided with heightened public anxiety over national security during the Cold War. The fascination with UFOs was fueled by a combination of secret military testing, cultural narratives, and increased media coverage.</p>

<p>Prior to the Maury Island Incident, the first reported UFO sighting in North America occurred in 1639, with subsequent reports leading to a growing public interest in unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the Maury Island Incident and other UFO sightings continue to capture public interest. While the U.S. Air Force and CIA have investigated various reports, no definitive conclusions have been reached regarding the nature of these sightings.</p>
