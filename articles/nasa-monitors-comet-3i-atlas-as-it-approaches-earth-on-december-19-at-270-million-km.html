      <h2>NASA monitors comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth on December 19 at 270 million km</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers, or 1.8 astronomical units. The American space agency has stated that this passage poses no threat to the planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed in our solar system. Continuous monitoring by NASA, the European Space Agency, and astronomers has tracked the comet's trajectory since its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 270 million km (1.8 astronomical units)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Up to 250,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Core diameter:</strong> Between 440 meters and 5.6 km</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Initial observations:</strong> June 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 30, 2025, at 210 million km from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Next approach:</strong> March 2026, close to Jupiter at 53.6 million km</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in preliminary observations in June 2025 before being confirmed in July by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. It was initially classified as a possible asteroid due to its hyperbolic orbit, which indicated its interstellar origin. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, intensifying its activity as solar radiation caused sublimation of ice, generating jets of gas.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2025, the comet passed within 29 million kilometers of Mars, allowing for observations by probes including Mars Express and MAVEN. Following this, it made a close pass at Venus on November 3, 2025, at a distance of 97 million kilometers.</p>

<p>Observations from November indicated that the comet had lost about two million tons of mass between July and October, and data from the European Space Agency's JUICE probe captured images of the comet's distinct tails.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Continuous monitoring data has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth,” NASA officials said. “We are excited to observe this unique interstellar visitor.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its interstellar origin, as indicated by its hyperbolic orbit and escape velocity greater than that of local objects. This comet's activity, including jets of gas and cryovolcanism, differs from typical comets found within the solar system, suggesting a formation in colder, distant environments of the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026, before it exits the solar system permanently. Observations are set to increase as the comet's visibility improves, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
