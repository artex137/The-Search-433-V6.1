      <h2>Putin jokes about 3I/ATLAS, calling it Russia’s ‘secret weapon’</h2>

<p>During a press conference on December 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin made light of the recently observed interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, referring to it as a “secret weapon.” The object, which has sparked interest among scientists and the public, passed about 210 million kilometers from Earth at a speed of approximately 246,000 kilometers per hour.</p>

<p>The object, known as 3I/ATLAS, is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected in the solar system. Following its closest approach, scientists have been closely monitoring its trajectory, with expectations that it will exit the solar system by early 2026. NASA and other space agencies have stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no danger to Earth and is best understood as a natural interstellar comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 210 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 246,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Exit from Solar System:</strong> Expected by early 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmed Interstellar Objects:</strong> Third, following ‘Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has captured attention since its entry into the solar system earlier this year. After a brief disappearance behind the Sun in October and November, it re-emerged, prompting renewed interest from astronomers and the public alike.</p>
<p>On December 19, during an annual press conference, President Putin jokingly referred to the comet as a “secret weapon” while assuring that it posed no threat to Earth. His comments were met with laughter from the audience.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I will let you in on something, but it must stay between us because it’s classified information. This is our secret weapon, but we will only use it as a last resort.” 
    <cite>— Vladimir Putin</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It’s a comet, and it doesn’t pose a threat to Earth.” 
    <cite>— Vladimir Putin</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things.” 
    <cite>— Tom Statler, NASA scientist</cite>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has reignited public fascination with the possibility of extraterrestrial life. However, NASA officials have consistently emphasized that there is no evidence to suggest that the object contains alien technology. The scientific community largely agrees that 3I/ATLAS is a natural phenomenon, despite some anomalies that have been noted.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. Research will focus on understanding its composition and behavior, while public interest in interstellar objects is expected to remain high.</p>
