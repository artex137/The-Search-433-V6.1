      <h2>ESA Uses Mars Rover Data To Track Comet 3I/ATLAS: Accuracy Leaps Ten-Fold</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has improved the accuracy of tracking comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object currently moving through our solar system, by utilizing data from its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. This breakthrough comes as the comet approaches Earth, having been first discovered in July 2025, and follows the detection of mysterious radio emissions from the comet.</p>

<p>This advancement is significant as it enhances the ability of astronomers to predict the comet's trajectory, which is vital for planetary defence protocols worldwide. ESA's innovative approach has demonstrated the effectiveness of combining data from different locations in space, allowing for a tenfold increase in precision in tracking the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Travelling at speeds exceeding 60 km/s.</li>
    <li>Size comparable to Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Radio emissions detected by a South African observatory.</li>
    <li>Data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter improved tracking accuracy by tenfold.</li>
    <li>ESA's Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre involved in monitoring efforts.</li>
    <li>Data from ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) expected in early 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025, sparking global interest due to its unusual trajectory and speed. In the following months, ESA utilized data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which provided a closer perspective on the comet, leading to significant improvements in trajectory prediction. The detection of radio emissions from the comet further heightened scrutiny from planetary defence experts.</p>

<p>As the comet nears the Sun, ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) is set to observe its activity, with findings anticipated in early 2026. This observation will provide crucial data on the comet’s behaviour as it interacts with solar winds.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This operation has been a crucial rehearsal for tracking potentially hazardous objects,” said a spokesperson from ESA. “The success required a combined effort from multiple teams, enhancing our capabilities in planetary defence.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor to our solar system. Its unique trajectory has raised concerns about potential impacts, leading to its classification as a space threat by the United Nations. The detection of radio emissions has been linked to natural processes occurring as volatile gases are released from the comet, further emphasizing the need for close observation.</p>

<p>This incident has highlighted the importance of international cooperation in monitoring space threats and improving detection methods for future potentially hazardous objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. The agency is also preparing its Neomir mission to target asteroids coming from the Sun's direction, which will enhance early warning capabilities. Additionally, ESA's Comet Interceptor mission aims to explore another interstellar object in the future, further advancing our understanding of these celestial wanderers.</p>
