      <h2>Nasa's interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in stunning new imagery</h2>

<p>NASA has released new imagery of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. The comet was discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) on July 1, 2023. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this celestial event.</p>

<p>The new images provide a clearer view of 3I/ATLAS, which has previously been tracked using ground-based observatories and Earth-orbiting spacecraft. The object is significant as it is only the third known interstellar object to be identified within our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA and the European Space Agency are closely monitoring its trajectory, which has been refined significantly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is more than 12 miles wide.</li>
    <li>It is traveling at approximately 37 miles per second relative to the sun.</li>
    <li>On Dec. 19, 2023, it will be within 170 million miles of Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet made its closest approach to Earth on Oct. 30, 2023, coming within 130 million miles.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to reach speeds of up to 153,000 mph as it continues its journey.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, NASA's ATLAS observatory discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. The object has since been monitored using various NASA telescopes, including the Hubble and Webb telescopes. On Oct. 30, 2023, 3I/ATLAS came within about 130 million miles of Earth. The European Space Agency has narrowed its orbital path significantly, and further observations are expected from its Juice spacecraft in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The path of comet 3I/ATLAS has been narrowed down by the European Space Agency by ten fold,” NASA reported.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a rare group of interstellar objects. Its discovery builds on the findings of 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have sparked interest in studying objects that originate from outside our solar system. The hyperbolic nature of 3I/ATLAS's orbit indicates it does not follow a closed path around the sun, distinguishing it from other comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth on Dec. 19, 2023. Further observations from the Juice spacecraft are anticipated, which may yield additional insights into the comet's characteristics and trajectory.</p>
