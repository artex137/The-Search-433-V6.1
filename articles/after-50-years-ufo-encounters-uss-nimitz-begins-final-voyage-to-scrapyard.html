      <h2>After 50 Years, UFO Encounters USS Nimitz Begins Final Voyage to Scrapyard</h2>

<p>The American nuclear aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN-68) has begun its final voyage after over 50 years in service, departing from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and heading to the continental United States on October 20, 2023. The carrier will first stop in San Diego, California, before proceeding to Bremerton, Washington, where it will be decommissioned and scrapped, scheduled for completion in 2026.</p>

<p>This significant event marks the end of an era for the USS Nimitz, the oldest aircraft carrier in U.S. service. Authorities are now preparing for its decommissioning while also addressing the implications of having only ten operational aircraft carriers in the U.S. Navy for the next two years amid rising global tensions, particularly concerning China.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>USS Nimitz was commissioned in 1975 and has served for over 50 years.</li>
<li>The carrier's last combat deployment began in March 2023.</li>
<li>It has operated in the Indo-Pacific region and the Middle East during its final deployment.</li>
<li>USS Nimitz will be replaced by USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79), scheduled for commissioning in 2027.</li>
<li>China has recently commissioned its third aircraft carrier and plans to add two more.</li>
<li>The decommissioning process for USS Nimitz is set to begin in 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Laid down in 1968, USS Nimitz was commissioned in 1975. Over its operational history, it participated in numerous military operations, including Eagle Claw (1979-1980), Desert Fox (1999), and Iraqi Freedom (2003). The carrier encountered a Tic-Tac shaped UFO in 2004, which has become a notable aspect of its legacy.</p>
<p>In March 2023, USS Nimitz embarked on its final combat deployment, which included operations in the South China Sea and the Middle East. Following its departure from Pearl Harbor on October 20, 2023, it will make stops in San Diego and Bremerton before decommissioning.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
"The USS Nimitz has served the United States Navy with distinction for over five decades, participating in critical operations around the globe," a Navy spokesperson said.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The USS Nimitz has been a key asset in U.S. naval operations, particularly during periods of heightened global tensions. Its decommissioning reflects a broader trend in the U.S. Navy's fleet management, as the service transitions to newer vessels while facing increasing competition from other nations, notably China.</p>
<p>China's recent advancements in naval capabilities, including the commissioning of new aircraft carriers, have raised concerns within the U.S. about maintaining maritime superiority.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the USS Nimitz prepares for decommissioning, the U.S. Navy will focus on the logistics of the scrapping process, which is expected to be lengthy and costly, beginning in 2026.</p>
