      <h2>NASA Telescope Observes Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Flare Exiting Solar System</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed by NASA’s SPHEREx space telescope as it dramatically brightened during its exit from the solar system in December 2025. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides crucial data about materials formed around other stars. The activity of 3I/ATLAS, which released gas, dust, and complex molecules, challenges previous understandings of comet behaviour following a close approach to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Event observed: December 2025</li>
  <li>Comet discovered: July 2025</li>
  <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/’Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
  <li>Lead author: Carey Lisse</li>
  <li>Publication: February 2026 in Research Notes of the AAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS asteroid survey. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun two months later. By December 2025, SPHEREx observed a significant increase in brightness and activity as the comet exited the solar system.</p>

<p>During this period, the comet developed a glowing coma rich in water vapor, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds. The observations revealed a pear-shaped dust tail formed from rocky material ejected during its heightened activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet was fully erupting into space in December 2025,” said Carey Lisse, the lead author of the study.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Cosmic rays likely processed its crust, but as sunlight penetrated deeper, ancient ices began to release a mix of long-hidden chemicals,” remarked Phil Korngut, a co-author of the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS has allowed for extended observations, providing insights into its chemical composition and interior.</p>

<p>Previous studies of comets have primarily focused on their behaviour close to the Sun. The findings from 3I/ATLAS may change how scientists understand the formation of celestial bodies and the distribution of essential materials for life throughout the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As research continues, scientists will further analyze the data collected from SPHEREx to explore the implications of the findings regarding comet 3I/ATLAS and its role in understanding interstellar materials.</p>
