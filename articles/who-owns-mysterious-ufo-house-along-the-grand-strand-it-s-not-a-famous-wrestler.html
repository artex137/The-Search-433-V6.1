      <h2>Who owns mysterious UFO house along the Grand Strand? It’s not a famous wrestler</h2>

<p>The "UFO house," officially known as "The Round House," is a unique home located on South Waccamaw Drive in Garden City, South Carolina. Built in 1976, the house has captured the attention of locals and visitors alike for nearly five decades. The home has withstood numerous hurricanes, including Hurricane Hugo in 1989, with no reported damage, according to family members. Walden Graham, who died on September 5, 2025, was one of the builders and used the house for family vacations.</p>

<p>This house matters as it stands out among traditional beach cottages, representing an innovative design aimed at hurricane resistance. Local interest in the house has grown, with many visitors curious about its unusual shape and history. The Graham family, owners of the home, have confirmed that they have no plans to sell it, choosing to keep it within the family.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: South Waccamaw Drive, Garden City, South Carolina</li>
    <li>Year built: 1976</li>
    <li>Owner: Graham family</li>
    <li>Design: Created by Miami architect Peter Vander Klout</li>
    <li>Construction purpose: Hurricane-resistant home</li>
    <li>Last major hurricane: Hurricane Hugo in 1989</li>
    <li>Current status: Family plans to retain ownership</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the early 1970s, Walden Graham and engineer Kenneth McDowell sought a project for their construction crews during downtimes. Inspired by a hurricane-resistant home featured in Popular Mechanics, they decided to build a similar structure in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The Round House was completed in 1976, becoming one of only six in the world at that time. Over the years, it has remained a popular attraction for its distinct UFO-like appearance and has survived multiple storms without damage.</p>
<p>Following Walden Graham's passing in September 2025, his sons Kenneth and Michael have confirmed their intention to keep the home in the family.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’ll keep it in the family,” Michael Graham said regarding the future of the house.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It was supposed to be hurricane proof,” Kenneth Graham said, referring to the home’s design.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’ve heard all kinds of stuff,” Kenneth Graham said about the various names people have called the home.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Round House is believed to be the last remaining home of its design in the United States. Most similar structures in Florida have either been abandoned or demolished over the years. The house's unique construction has made it a subject of curiosity and fascination among both locals and tourists.</p>
<p>Hurricane Hugo, which struck in 1989, was a significant storm that tested the home's resilience, as many surrounding properties were damaged or destroyed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Graham family plans to continue maintaining the home as a family retreat, with no current plans for renovations or sales. They will keep the house as a lasting legacy of their father’s innovative vision.</p>
