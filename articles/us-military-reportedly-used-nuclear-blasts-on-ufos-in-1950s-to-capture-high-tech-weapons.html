      <h2>US Military Reportedly Used Nuclear Blasts on UFOs in 1950s</h2>

<p>Filmmaker Dan Farah has claimed that the US military detonated nuclear weapons in the 1950s to disable unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and capture advanced technology. Farah made these assertions during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience, stating that high-level military insiders provided him with this information over a four-year investigation. No physical evidence of these claims has been presented.</p>

<p>This revelation has sparked renewed discussions about UFO secrecy and the competition for advanced military technology. While US government agencies maintain there is no confirmed evidence of extraterrestrial craft, Farah argues that the consistency of accounts from former officials indicates a significant cover-up involving multiple governments.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Filmmaker Dan Farah claims US military used nuclear blasts against UFOs in the 1950s.</li>
    <li>Claims were made during an interview on the Joe Rogan Experience.</li>
    <li>No physical evidence has been presented to support these allegations.</li>
    <li>Farah interviewed high-level government and military insiders over four years.</li>
    <li>1,054 nuclear tests occurred in the US between 1945 and 1992, according to the Department of Energy.</li>
    <li>Locations of nuclear tests included the Nevada desert and the Pacific Ocean.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to Farah, the US military's use of nuclear detonations against UFOs began in the 1950s. He claims that these tests were strategically positioned in areas known for UFO activity. The practice allegedly aimed to destabilise UFO propulsion systems, creating a "ripple effect" that could make the craft vulnerable.</p>

<p>Farah's documentary outlines what he describes as an 80-year global cover-up involving multiple governments. It features interviews with former officials, including members of Congress, discussing alleged retrieval programmes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Pentagon has repeatedly stated that investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena have no verifiable proof of recovered alien technology,” said a spokesperson from the US government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Farah noted, “The consistency of accounts from former intelligence officials suggests a coordinated effort to keep such programmes hidden.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This revelation comes in the context of increased public interest in UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena. Various government officials, including Congressman Tim Burchett, have expressed concerns about alleged underwater UFO bases and the implications of foreign powers potentially advancing in reverse-engineering alien technology.</p>

<p>Farah argues that the competition for alien technology has become a new Cold War, with Russia and China also pursuing similar goals. The filmmaker claims that some US officials fear that these nations may already have an advantage in exploiting recovered materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Farah believes that pressure from members of the Trump administration on current Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to investigate these allegations may lead to further disclosures. However, officials have not yet commented on the filmmaker's claims.</p>
