      <h2>NASA Faces Growing Pressure to Unveil Latest Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA is under increasing pressure to release new images of Comet 3I/ATLAS, a mysterious cosmic visitor first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. The comet, which is not a threat to Earth, has sparked significant interest among scientists and space enthusiasts as it travels through our solar system.</p>

<p>The significance of Comet 3I/ATLAS lies in its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originates from outside our solar system. NASA has mobilized its fleet of telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, to track the comet's movement and gather data about its composition and origins. As the comet approaches the Sun, researchers hope to gain insights into the formation and behavior of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is currently over 400 million miles (about 645 million kilometers) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at approximately 150,000 mph (241,402 km/h).</li>
    <li>Its estimated size ranges from 10 to 20 km (6 to 12 miles) in width.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 170 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass near Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2025, pre-discovery images of Comet 3I/ATLAS were captured, with the first official detection reported on July 1, 2025. NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile made the discovery. As of August 2025, Hubble's observations have suggested that the comet's nucleus may range from 440 meters to 5.6 kilometers across. As the comet approaches the Sun, NASA's telescopes are expected to provide more detailed observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet offers a unique opportunity to study a celestial body from outside our solar system,” NASA officials stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Anna Paulina Luna, an American politician, has formally requested the release of more images and data on the comet, emphasizing the importance of this information for the scientific community.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it represents one of the few known hyperbolic comets, which are not bound by the Sun's gravity and are believed to originate from interstellar space. The comet's journey through our solar system provides a rare chance to study the characteristics of such objects and their implications for understanding the environments of distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to track Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and gathers data. The agency is expected to release more images and findings as the comet nears its closest approach to Earth in December 2025.</p>
