      <h2>NASA Activates Earth Defense Group Over Concerns Of Manhattan-Sized Comet With Possible Alien Technology</h2>

<p>A NASA-backed planetary defense group has begun efforts to locate comet 3I/ATLAS after reports of unusual behavior from the object. The comet, which is the size of Manhattan and may possess alien technology, has been classified as a threat by the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN).</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it marks the first time an interstellar object has been prioritized by the group, which includes a global coalition of space experts. Authorities aim to assess the potential impact of 3I/ATLAS and enhance preparedness for any threats from space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed on July 21 by the Hubble Telescope.</li>
    <li>Size of the comet is comparable to Manhattan.</li>
    <li>IAWN has listed 3I/ATLAS as a potential threat.</li>
    <li>Comet discharges a column with four grams of nickel per second.</li>
    <li>IAWN's "comet campaign" scheduled from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was photographed by the Hubble Telescope. Following this observation, NASA and IAWN noted its unusual behaviors, including an anti-tail and a particle jet directed at the sun. These anomalies prompted the activation of the planetary defense group.</p>
<p>The group has since intensified its focus on the comet, recognizing its potential threat and preparing for a detailed assessment campaign set to begin in late November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The bizarre behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unprecedented for a comet,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University. “The non-gravitational acceleration and its unusual trajectory raise questions about its nature.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This initiative follows a growing global focus on planetary defense against near-Earth objects. The formation of the IAWN represents a collaborative effort to detect and monitor potentially hazardous asteroids and comets.</p>
<p>Previous incidents involving comet observations have underscored the need for preparedness and response strategies in the face of potential threats from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will continue its "comet campaign" from November 27, 2025, through January 27, 2026, to pinpoint the precise location of 3I/ATLAS and assess its potential impact on Earth.</p>
