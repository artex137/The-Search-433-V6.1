      <h2>NASA Activates Earth Defense Group Over Concerns Of Manhattan-Sized Comet With Possible Alien Technology</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its Earth Defense Group in response to concerns regarding Comet 3I ATLAS, a comet approximately the size of Manhattan, which may possess alien technology. The decision was made recently as the comet approaches Earth.</p>

<p>This activation is significant as it highlights the potential threat posed by celestial objects. NASA is mobilizing resources to monitor the comet and assess any risks it may present to Earth. The agency has initiated discussions with international space agencies to coordinate efforts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS measures approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Nasa's Earth Defense Group has been activated.</li>
    <li>The activation occurred recently as the comet approaches Earth.</li>
    <li>Authorities are coordinating with international space agencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has been monitoring Comet 3I ATLAS since its discovery. As the comet's trajectory brought it closer to Earth, concerns about its size and potential alien technology prompted the activation of the Earth Defense Group.</p>

<p>In the days leading up to the activation, NASA scientists conducted assessments and held meetings to determine the best course of action. The agency is now focused on ongoing surveillance of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are taking this situation seriously and are prepared to act if necessary,” said a spokesperson for NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS is not the first celestial object to raise concerns. Previous incidents involving near-Earth objects have prompted similar responses from NASA and other space agencies. The agency's Earth Defense Group was established to enhance preparedness for potential threats from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor Comet 3I ATLAS closely and will provide updates on its trajectory and any potential risks. Coordination with international agencies will remain a priority as the situation develops.</p>
