      <h2>Latest Update on Interstellar Comet 3I ATLAS as Hubble Captures New Image</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has released a new high-resolution image of interstellar comet 3I ATLAS, observed on November 30, 2025. This comet is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor observed passing through our Solar System, and the latest image reveals structural details in its coma and tail.</p>

<p>This update is significant for astronomers as it provides fresh insight into the comet’s composition and behavior. NASA and the European Space Agency confirmed the release of the image on December 5, 2025. The data collected could enhance understanding of materials formed in other star systems and how they behave under solar heating.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
  <li>At discovery, it was 4.51 astronomical units from the Sun and traveling at approximately 58 km/s.</li>
  <li>The comet passed 0.194 AU from Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
  <li>It reached its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
  <li>3I ATLAS will make a close approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, at a distance of 0.357 AU.</li>
  <li>During the November 30 observation, the comet was about 286 million km from Earth.</li>
  <li>The new Hubble image shows a 40,000 km radius glow and an anti-tail stretching roughly 60,000 km.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. It passed near Mars on October 3 and reached perihelion on October 30. The comet was observed again on November 30, 2025, with Hubble capturing new details of its structure. The European Space Agency and NASA confirmed the image release on December 5, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard University astrophysicist, stated that the new image shows a glow and anti-tail that likely result from macroscopic fragments separating from the comet after perihelion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted that the observed pattern of fragment separation matches his earlier predictions.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, with only two others confirmed: 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of these objects has become an active area of research, particularly following debates regarding the unusual characteristics of ’Oumuamua.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring of 3I ATLAS will continue as it exits the Solar System over the coming months. Scientists expect that tracking its fragments will provide valuable data on the structure and durability of interstellar objects.</p>
