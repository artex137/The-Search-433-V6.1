      <h2>Baba Vanga’s chilling 2026 alien prediction to come true? Donald Trump’s latest UFO move sparks shock due to…</h2>

<p>A decades-old prophecy by Baba Vanga has resurfaced following US President Donald Trump’s order to release secret government files related to aliens and UFOs. This development raises questions about the implications of newly disclosed records concerning unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This matter has gained significant attention as authorities work to provide transparency regarding UAPs. The renewed focus on Baba Vanga’s prophecy coincides with increasing public interest in UFOs, especially after former US President Barack Obama suggested the existence of unexplained aerial objects during a February interview.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Baba Vanga, born in 1911, was a blind Bulgarian mystic known for her predictions.</li>
    <li>She reportedly predicted first contact with aliens in November 2026.</li>
    <li>Her followers claim she foresaw a “massive spacecraft” entering Earth’s atmosphere.</li>
    <li>Baba Vanga lost her sight at age 12 due to a tornado.</li>
    <li>Critics argue that many of her predictions have been exaggerated or misinterpreted.</li>
    <li>Trump directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to release materials on UAPs and UFOs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Baba Vanga reportedly made her predictions throughout her life, with many followers documenting them after her death in 1996. In February 2020, former President Barack Obama suggested in an interview that unexplained aerial objects exist, sparking further interest in UFOs.</p>
<p>In response to growing speculation, Donald Trump ordered the release of government files related to UFOs, directing the Pentagon to disclose information on UAPs. This order has led to heightened public interest in both UFOs and Baba Vanga’s prophecies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Humans will make first contact with aliens in November 2026,” claimed supporters of Baba Vanga.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Many predictions have been exaggerated or misinterpreted over time,” noted critics of Baba Vanga’s prophecies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Baba Vanga, often referred to as the “Nostradamus of the Balkans,” has a legacy of predictions that continue to attract attention. While her followers believe in the accuracy of her foresight, skeptics highlight the lack of written records and the potential for misinterpretation. The recent focus on UFOs has been amplified by public statements from political figures, increasing the demand for transparency regarding extraterrestrial matters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations into UAPs continue, the release of government files is expected to provide more information on UFOs. The public will be watching closely for any revelations that could align with Baba Vanga’s predictions or further clarify the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>
