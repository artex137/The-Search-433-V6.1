      <h2>Comet or UFO? This scientist shares 9 reasons why the 3I/ATLAS is a spacecraft and not a comet</h2>

<p>In July 2025, the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS entered our Solar System, prompting debate among astronomers about its true nature. Avi Loeb, a physicist at Harvard University, has raised nine points suggesting that 3I/ATLAS may not be a comet, but rather a spacecraft. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this object.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges the prevailing understanding of interstellar objects and raises questions about the search for extraterrestrial life. While most of the scientific community maintains that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, Loeb's arguments have ignited discussions about more exotic possibilities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a physicist at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to be over 3 miles (approximately 4.8 kilometres) across and weigh about 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has shown unusual characteristics, including a second tail pointing toward the Sun.</li>
    <li>It will pass within approximately 53 million kilometres of Jupiter in early 2026.</li>
    <li>The object reflects light with extreme negative polarisation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS enters the Solar System, capturing the attention of astronomers worldwide. Avi Loeb begins to analyze its trajectory and physical characteristics, proposing that its unusual features warrant consideration of it being a spacecraft rather than a comet. Observations continue, revealing its close proximity to Mars and future approach to Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb said, "While the simplest explanation remains that it is a comet, these quirks force us to consider more exotic possibilities.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS follows previous discussions about interstellar objects, particularly the first confirmed interstellar object, Oumuamua, which Loeb controversially suggested might have been a spacecraft. This ongoing dialogue reflects a growing interest in the nature of objects that enter our Solar System and their implications for the search for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and analyses of 3I/ATLAS are expected as it approaches Jupiter in early 2026. Scientists will continue to study its characteristics to better understand its origins and composition.</p>
