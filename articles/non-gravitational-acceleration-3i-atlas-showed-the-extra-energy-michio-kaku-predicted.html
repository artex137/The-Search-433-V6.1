      <h2>Non-Gravitational Acceleration: 3I/ATLAS Showed The Extra Energy Michio Kaku Predicted</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has exhibited non-gravitational acceleration, aligning with predictions made by theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku during a televised interview on Newsmax in late October. Kaku warned that if the comet received an "extra burst of energy," it could indicate potential visitation from extraterrestrial sources. This event occurred on October 30, the day 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion.</p>

<p>This development has drawn attention from the scientific community, prompting researchers to reassess current models of cometary behaviour. Authorities, including NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), are analyzing the data to understand the implications of this anomaly and what it may mean for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA's JPL Horizons system recorded a non-gravitational acceleration of 1.6 x 10<sup>-6</sup> au/day<sup>2</sup> on that date.</li>
    <li>By November 24, this value was revised to 4 x 10<sup>-7</sup> au/day<sup>2</sup>.</li>
    <li>The object's acceleration deviated significantly from expected gravitational trajectories.</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb from Harvard has published analyses suggesting possible 'intelligent control' of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2023, Dr. Michio Kaku made a public statement regarding the potential for 3I/ATLAS to exhibit non-gravitational acceleration. He specified that the world should "watch for it" on October 30, the date of perihelion.</p>
<p>On October 30, NASA's JPL recorded the non-gravitational acceleration of 3I/ATLAS. The value was significant enough to prompt multiple trajectory revisions by JPL. By November 24, the acceleration value was updated, but the presence of the anomaly remained confirmed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If the object received an extra burst of energy, we are being visited,” Kaku stated during his interview.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The JPL Horizons model underestimates the object's brightness surge near perihelion,” Dr. Loeb noted in his analysis.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has raised questions about the standard cometary model. Traditionally, non-gravitational acceleration is attributed to the sublimation of volatiles, but the magnitude and duration observed in 3I/ATLAS do not fit these explanations. Past interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have also been scrutinized for unusual behaviours, prompting discussions about their origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the closest observation window approaches on December 19, scientists will closely monitor 3I/ATLAS for any further deviations from known models. This data may shift the conversation regarding the object's nature and its implications for our understanding of the cosmos.</p>
