      <h2>3I/ATLAS: More Pics Captured By Canadian Astrophotographer Paul Craggs Of The Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>Canadian astrophotographer Paul Craggs has captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first observed on July 1, 2025. The comet is currently on its trajectory out of the solar system after its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unusual characteristics, including non-gravitational acceleration and an elliptical orbit. Experts, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have speculated about its potential extraterrestrial origin. As the comet approaches a close flyby of Earth on December 19, 2025, and Jupiter in March 2026, scientists are closely monitoring its path and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>First spotted:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Next close flyby:</strong> Earth on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Next close flyby:</strong> Jupiter in March 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Notable characteristics:</strong> Non-gravitational acceleration, nickel abundance</li>
    <li><strong>Imaging technology:</strong> HiRISE camera aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. It exhibited unusual behavior, prompting scientists to investigate its origins. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, a date noted by Avi Loeb as potentially significant. As it moves away from the Sun, it is scheduled for a close flyby of Earth on December 19, 2025, followed by Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behavior of 3I/ATLAS raises intriguing questions about its origin and composition,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third recorded interstellar visitor to our solar system. Its detection adds to the growing body of research on interstellar objects, which have become a focus of scientific inquiry in recent years. The unusual characteristics of this comet have sparked discussions on the potential for extraterrestrial influences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and Jupiter. Further observations are expected to provide insights into its composition and trajectory, contributing to the understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
