      <h2>Study says Mississippi is one of the last places you’re going to see a UFO</h2>

<p>MISSISSIPPI — A new study has ranked Mississippi among the worst states for reported UFO sightings, with only 7.82 sightings per 1 million residents each year. The analysis, conducted by social casino website McLuck, examined reports filed with the National UFO Reporting Center from 2020 to 2024. There have been no injuries or fatalities reported related to UFO sightings in the state.</p>

<p>This ranking is significant as it reflects the interest and belief in UFOs among the public. McLuck researchers have stated the study aims to provide a clearer picture of how likely residents are to report unexplained aerial phenomena, rather than simply counting total sightings. The findings may influence how residents engage in skywatching activities, particularly during certain times of the year.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mississippi ranked 48th out of 50 states for UFO sightings.</li>
    <li>There were 115 reported sightings in Mississippi from 2020 to 2024.</li>
    <li>October is the most common month for sightings in the state.</li>
    <li>9 p.m. is the most frequent time for sightings in Mississippi.</li>
    <li>Vermont leads all states with an average of 33 sightings per 1 million residents.</li>
    <li>Texas, despite high total sightings, ranked last overall with 7.01 sightings per 1 million residents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The study analyzed UFO sighting reports from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2024, focusing on patterns by state, month, and time of day.</p>
<p>In 2023, there was a notable increase in reports from Idaho, while Maine saw a 29% rise in sightings year-over-year.</p>
<p>The report was released on Tuesday, revealing trends in UFO sightings across the United States.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our study reveals the states with the highest number of UFO sightings over five years, finding that the summer months are the best time of year to spot one,” said Joerg Nottebaum, a spokesperson for McLuck.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies have shown varying results regarding UFO sightings in Mississippi. A different analysis ranked the state as the 4th most likely to see a UFO, based on different criteria. The discrepancy highlights the complexity of UFO reporting and public interest.</p>
<p>Interest in UFOs remains strong nationwide, with a recent YouGov survey indicating that over 60% of Americans believe the U.S. government is concealing information about UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor and analyze UFO sightings to identify trends and changes in public interest. For residents in Mississippi, the study suggests that fall evenings, particularly in October, may offer the best chance of spotting something unexplained.</p>
