      <h2>NASA images of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS raise new questions about its origin</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, captured by various spacecraft, raising questions about its origin. The object, discovered in July 2023, has intrigued the scientific community due to its unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>The images have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, according to NASA officials. This revelation counters earlier speculations that it might be an "alien spaceship" or "Trojan Horse." NASA's Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya stated that the findings are significant because the object originated outside the solar system, making it an important subject of study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Discovery Date: July 2023</li>
  <li>Confirmed Nature: Comet</li>
  <li>NASA Officials Involved: Amit Kshatriya, Nicky Fox</li>
  <li>Spacecraft Used: James Webb Space Telescope, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Perseverance Mars rover, Lucy probe</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 and has since garnered attention due to its unique features. NASA has released images from multiple spacecraft, confirming its status as a comet. The scientific community has debated its origins, with some initially suggesting it could be an extraterrestrial probe.</p>

<p>On a recent press briefing, Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, stated that there is no evidence of 3I/ATLAS being anything other than a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, NASA Associate Administrator: “It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet. But this one came from outside the solar system, which makes it fascinating, exciting and scientifically very important.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nicky Fox, NASA Science Mission Directorate: “We have not witnessed any technosignatures or anything from the interstellar comet that would lead us to believe that it is not a natural comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflects ongoing curiosity about interstellar objects and their origins. Previous findings of similar objects have led to debates in the scientific community regarding their classification and nature. The confirmation of 3I/ATLAS as a comet adds to the understanding of how such bodies behave when they enter the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA officials plan to continue studying 3I/ATLAS and its anomalies. They aim to further investigate its characteristics and gather additional data to enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
