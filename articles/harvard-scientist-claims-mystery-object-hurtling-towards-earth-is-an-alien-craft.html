      <h2>Harvard scientist claims mystery object hurtling towards Earth is an alien craft</h2>

<p>A Harvard academic has proposed that an interstellar entity, named 3I/ATLAS, is speeding towards Earth and may have been sent by extraterrestrials to evaluate human cognitive abilities. Professor Avi Loeb has suggested that immediate action is required before the object enters the solar system.</p>

<p>This claim raises significant questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and the implications of potential extraterrestrial contact. Authorities, including NASA, are being urged to consider the possibility of communication or interception with the object as it approaches, though many scientists have dismissed these ideas as speculative.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: 221,000 km/hr</li>
    <li>Proposed interception date: March 14, 2026</li>
    <li>Proposed NASA spacecraft: Juno, launched in 2011</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2023, at 29 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Close approach distance to Mars: 2.7 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Professor Loeb has made several calculations regarding 3I/ATLAS's trajectory. He has noted that if NASA's Juno spacecraft accelerates by 2.6 kilometers per second on September 14, 2025, it could reach 3I/ATLAS on March 14, 2026.</p>

<p>Loeb has also indicated that 3I/ATLAS will approach Mars on October 3, 2023, at a distance of 29 million kilometers, closing to just 2.7 million kilometers within a few days.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The close encounter of 3I/ATLAS to Jupiter provides a rare opportunity to shift Juno from its current orbit around Jupiter to intercept the path of 3I/ATLAS at its closest approach to Jupiter.” 
    <strong>- Professor Avi Loeb</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>Loeb has suggested that Juno could use its scientific instruments to probe 3I/ATLAS closely. He has described the object's illumination as resembling "a vehicle turning on its headlights," proposing that it could be powered by nuclear energy.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions about 3I/ATLAS have focused on its classification as a comet. However, Loeb's assertions challenge this notion, leading to a debate among scientists about the object's true nature and origin. Many researchers remain skeptical of the idea that it is an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations are necessary to assess the validity of Loeb's claims. NASA and other space agencies may need to consider options for observing or communicating with 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars and Jupiter in the coming months.</p>
