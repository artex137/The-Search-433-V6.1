      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion and allows real-time online observation</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its perihelion, following a hyperbolic trajectory in the Solar System. The comet, detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS project in Chile, moves at approximately <strong>210,000 km/h</strong> and will pass Earth at a minimum distance of <strong>270 million km</strong> on December 19, 2025. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with its passage.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar body, following 1I/Ê»Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Authorities, including NASA and various astronomical organizations, are actively monitoring the comet using ground-based telescopes and space probes. Real-time online observation platforms are available for the public to track its movement.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Speed: <strong>210,000 km/h</strong>.</li>
    <li>Minimum distance from Earth: <strong>270 million km</strong>.</li>
    <li>Scheduled exit from the Solar System: January 2026.</li>
    <li>Brightness: 10,000 to 100,000 times dimmer than typical Martian targets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was identified on July 2025 by the ATLAS project in Chile. NASA has confirmed its hyperbolic orbit, indicating its origin from outside the Solar System. Following its perihelion, the comet is now on a trajectory back to interstellar space.</p>
<p>During its passage, various space probes, including the Chinese Tianwen-1 and European Mars Express, have captured images of the comet. These images reveal the comet's coma and the rare optical phenomenon known as an anti-tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity for both professionals and enthusiasts to observe an interstellar body,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS marks a significant advancement in the study of interstellar objects. Previous incidents, such as the detection of 1I/Ê»Oumuamua in 2017, have sparked interest in the composition and origins of celestial bodies from outside our Solar System. The ability to track and analyze these objects enhances our understanding of planetary formation across the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The comet's trajectory has been mapped to ensure no collision risks with Earth. Observations will continue, with updates provided by the Minor Planet Center and various online platforms. Researchers and amateur astronomers will have ongoing access to data for tracking the comet’s movement.</p>
