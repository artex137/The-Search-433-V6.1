      <h2>NASA deepens investigation of comet 3I/Atlas, revealing star formation secrets</h2>

<p>NASA has expanded its observations of comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object, as part of a campaign scheduled for 2025. The agency aims to understand the comet's unique trajectory and composition, which have intrigued scientists worldwide.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it provides an opportunity to decipher the mysteries surrounding the origins of interstellar objects and the formation processes of stars and planetary systems. NASA's investigation will utilize both space assets and ground-based telescopes to enhance data collection and analysis throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet's hyperbolic orbit suggests it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA's observation campaign for 2025 includes the use of the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>Ground-based observatories such as Keck will contribute detailed spectroscopy and astrometry.</li>
    <li>Preliminary analyses indicate a different chemical composition than most solar system comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late 2024, initial observations of comet 3I/Atlas revealed its unusual nature, including its high speed and unique chemical characteristics. NASA has since planned an intensive observation campaign for 2025 to gather more data on the comet's composition and origins.</p>
<p>The data collection will involve collaboration among various international observatories to ensure comprehensive analysis and validation of findings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The study of interstellar objects like 3I/Atlas has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of planetary formation and astrobiology,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“By investigating these celestial travelers, we can gain insights into the diversity of materials available in different regions of the galaxy,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The investigation of interstellar objects has grown in importance as astronomers seek to understand the origins of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. The previous discovery of interstellar objects has led to new questions about the formation of stars and planets in varied environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue its observation campaign throughout 2025, focusing on the chemical analysis of comet 3I/Atlas. The findings could lead to new insights into the conditions of the protoplanetary disk where the comet originated, shaping future research in astrophysics and our understanding of the universe.</p>
