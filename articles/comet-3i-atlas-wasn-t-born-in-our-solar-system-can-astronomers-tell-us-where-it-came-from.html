      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS wasn't born in our Solar System: Can Astronomers tell us where it came from?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object detected, is moving through the solar system at approximately 220,000 km/h, following its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS alert system. Its origin remains a mystery as scientists work to understand its path and potential stellar encounters.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it could provide insights into the formation of planetary systems. A study led by researchers from Spain and Sweden, recently submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters, aims to reconstruct the comet's trajectory using data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Gaia mission. The findings may help clarify whether 3I/ATLAS originated from the Milky Way's thick disk, suggesting it could be older than the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS alert system.</li>
    <li>Comet is traveling at approximately 220,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun is expected at the end of October 2025.</li>
    <li>Research led by Xabier Pérez Couto from the Universidade da Coruña.</li>
    <li>Study titled “3I/ATLAS: In Search of the Witnesses to Its Voyage” submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters.</li>
    <li>Analysis revealed 93 encounters with stars over 10 million years, 62 of which were considered reliable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS alert system discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet's trajectory has been analyzed using data from ESA's Gaia mission, revealing its path over the past 10 million years. Researchers traced the comet's orbit and identified multiple encounters with nearby stars.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches the Sun, scientists are observing its unique cometary activity, which has resulted in the release of gases and dust, forming a bright coma and tail. This activity offers a chance to study materials from a different region of the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The uniqueness of this comet lies in its cometary activity, allowing scientists to directly analyze the materials it is made of,” said the researchers.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object detected, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous studies have suggested that interstellar objects may provide insights into the evolution of planetary systems. The Vera Rubin Observatory is expected to significantly increase the discovery rate of such objects, with estimates suggesting one to two interstellar objects could be found each year.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As scientists continue to study comet 3I/ATLAS, they aim to gather more data and refine their understanding of its origin. Future observations from ground-based and space telescopes will further enhance knowledge about this interstellar visitor.</p>
