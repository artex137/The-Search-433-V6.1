      <h2>'It's Our Secret Weapon': Putin's Interstellar Joke On 3I/Atlas Comet As It Passes Earth</h2>

<p>Moscow: Russian President Vladimir Putin joked about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during his annual question-and-answer session at Moscow's Gostiny Dvor on December 19. He referred to the comet as a Russian "secret weapon" in response to a journalist's inquiry regarding conspiracy theories about the comet's origins.</p>

<p>The discussion around 3I/ATLAS is significant as it highlights public interest in space phenomena and the government's stance on such events. Putin addressed questions about the comet's potential danger, stating that it poses no threat to Earth and is being monitored by Russian scientists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Annual question-and-answer session with President Vladimir Putin</li>
    <li>Date: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Gostiny Dvor, Moscow</li>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS, estimated size between 2 to 6 km</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Hundreds of millions of km</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19, during a live press event, a journalist asked Putin about the comet 3I/ATLAS and its possible artificial origins. Putin responded with humor, referring to the comet as a "secret weapon" while assuring that Russian scientists are monitoring its approach.</p>
<p>He explained the comet's unique characteristics, noting that it originates from another galaxy and behaves differently than typical comets. Putin confirmed that it will not pose a threat to Earth and will depart the solar system early next year.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Is your name Christina? I’ll tell you, but it must remain exclusively between us. This is classified information. It’s our secret weapon, but we will only use it in the most extreme case, because we are against deploying weapons in space,” said Putin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Seriously though, it’s a comet. Our scientists are aware of what is happening... I don’t think it poses any threat to us,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The conversation around 3I/ATLAS reflects ongoing public fascination with space exploration and the unknown. Previous discussions have included various theories regarding unidentified flying objects and their implications, often leading to speculation about extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Putin's comments serve to reassure the public about the government's capability to track and assess potential threats from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Russian scientists will continue to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and prepares to exit the solar system in early 2024. Further updates on its path and characteristics will likely be released by Roscosmos, Russia's space agency.</p>
