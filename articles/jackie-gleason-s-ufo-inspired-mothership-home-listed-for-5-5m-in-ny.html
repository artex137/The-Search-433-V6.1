      <h2>Jackie Gleason’s UFO-Inspired ‘Mothership’ Home Listed for $5.5M in NY</h2>

<p>Jackie Gleason’s former residence, known as “The Mothership,” has been listed for $5.5 million in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The architectural oddity, built in the 1950s, reflects Gleason’s fascination with UFOs and outer space. The property spans 3.17 acres and features a circular main house with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, along with a guest cottage.</p>

<p>This listing has garnered attention due to the home’s unique design and historical significance. Gleason, famed for his role in “The Honeymooners,” reportedly designed the home as a retreat from New York City life. The property is positioned in a market that sees rising interest in vintage celebrity homes, especially those with unique architectural features.</p>

The home’s unique characteristics have made it a point of interest for collectors of architectural curiosities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The listing agent has highlighted the potential for expansion on the property, suggesting that it could accommodate amenities like a pool or studio space. As the market evolves, the home may attract buyers seeking to blend historical significance with modern luxury.</p>
