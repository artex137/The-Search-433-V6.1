      <h2>Unusual New 3I/ATLAS Discovery Suggests the Interstellar Comet is “Anomalously Massive”</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been identified as extremely large, according to a study released by a team of researchers including Richard Cloete, Peter Vere, and Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb. The findings, based on precise tracking data collected since the comet's discovery in July, indicate that 3I/ATLAS is “anomalously massive” compared to other interstellar objects observed in the solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges previous expectations about the size and composition of interstellar objects. The study places new limits on the comet's non-gravitational acceleration and overall mass, prompting further investigation into its characteristics and behavior as it traverses the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has a minimum diameter of approximately 5 kilometers (slightly more than 3 miles).</li>
    <li>Its estimated mass loss is around 150 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>Gas outflow is calculated at approximately 440 meters per second.</li>
    <li>More than 4,000 astrometric measurements of 3I/ATLAS have been collected from 227 observatories globally.</li>
    <li>The upper limit on non-gravitational acceleration is less than 15 meters per day squared.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discovery and analysis of 3I/ATLAS have unfolded as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>July 2023: 3I/ATLAS is discovered.</li>
    <li>May to September 2023: Over 4,000 astrometric measurements are collected from various observatories.</li>
    <li>August 2023: Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope provide additional data on the comet's mass loss and gas outflow.</li>
    <li>Late August 2023: Images from Gemini South reveal a conventional cometary tail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>“The fact that 3I/ATLAS appears to be so much more massive than the first confirmed interstellar object, ‘Oumuamua, makes it very unusual,” said Avi Loeb in an email to The Debrief.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>“If you combine all of them, the probability is extremely small for it to belong to their class,” Loeb added, discussing the anomalies of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in the solar system, following ʻOumuamua and Borisov. Previous studies have shown that interstellar objects are expected to be smaller and less massive. Loeb's earlier paper suggested that such large objects should be exceedingly rare, proposing a detection rate of less than once per ten thousand years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research team plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Additional observations will help clarify the comet's composition and behavior, as well as its potential implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
