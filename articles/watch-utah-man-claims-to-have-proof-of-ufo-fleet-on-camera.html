      <h2>Utah Man Claims To Have Proof Of UFO 'Fleet' On Camera</h2>

<p>A Utah man has shared a video that he claims shows a 'fleet' of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) recorded over a lake in northern Utah at approximately 11 A.M. on January 17, 2026. The witness, identified as Scott C. Waring, has not disclosed the specific location of the footage, which has generated significant attention online in the past 48 hours.</p>

<p>This video raises questions about the authenticity of UAP sightings and has prompted interest from both the public and authorities. The footage appears to show what looks like fiery debris over a body of water, possibly the Great Salt Lake, though this has not been verified by Waring. The video has been shared on platforms such as YouTube and UFO Sightings Daily.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 17, 2026, Scott C. Waring recorded a video that he alleges shows a fleet of UAP over a lake in northern Utah. He later shared the video online, prompting public interest and speculation about the authenticity of the footage. Waring stated he recorded four or five short videos of the event, with two additional videos taken ten minutes later showing the area without the objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I recorded 4 or 5 short videos of the event and two of the area ten minutes later with the object no longer there. The objects look like two long disks. The smaller disk is about 2 miles across and the bigger disk is about 5 miles across,” said Waring on UFO Sightings Daily.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
