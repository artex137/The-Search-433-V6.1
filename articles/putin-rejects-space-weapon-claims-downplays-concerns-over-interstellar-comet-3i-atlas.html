      <h2>Putin rejects space weapon claims, downplays concerns over interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed concerns regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during his annual year-end press conference in Moscow on December 20, 2025. He stated that the comet does not pose a security threat and is a naturally occurring object.</p>

<p>This statement comes amid ongoing discussions about the militarisation of space. Putin emphasized Russia's opposition to deploying weapons in space and reassured the public that there is no cause for alarm regarding the comet, which is being monitored by scientists from a distance of hundreds of millions of kilometres.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Annual year-end press conference</li>
    <li>Date: December 20, 2025</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 20, 2025, Putin held his year-end press conference where he addressed various topics, including the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. He responded to speculation about the comet's potential as a security threat, firmly stating that it is not a man-made object and poses no danger.</p>
<p>Putin further clarified that while interstellar objects may behave differently, experts have a thorough understanding of the processes involved and see no reason for concern.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We are against deploying weapons in space and there is no threat in this case,” Putin said during the press conference.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This comet is our secret weapon,” he joked, before emphasizing that it is a naturally occurring object.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Concerns about the militarisation of space have been a topic of international debate. Russia has consistently opposed the deployment of weapons in space, asserting that such actions could lead to increased tensions globally. The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflects ongoing anxieties about potential threats from celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor the comet and provide updates as necessary. Scientific tracking of interstellar objects will remain a priority to ensure public safety and mitigate any potential misunderstandings.</p>
