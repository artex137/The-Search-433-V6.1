      <h2>Flick Fact: Is this a good place to see a UFO?</h2>

<p>A new study has revealed that Illinois is among the least likely states in the U.S. to spot an unidentified flying object (UFO), with 558 reported sightings between 2020 and 2024. The findings, released on September 28, 2025, indicate that there have been no injuries or fatalities related to these sightings.</p>

<p>This information is significant for UFO enthusiasts and researchers. According to the study, the frequency of reported sightings in Illinois is notably low compared to other states, sparking interest in why this is the case. Authorities and UFO researchers are now analyzing these trends to understand the patterns of sightings in the state.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>558 reported UFO sightings in Illinois from 2020 to 2024.</li>
    <li>Illinois ranks among the five states least likely to see a UFO.</li>
    <li>April is the most common month for sightings.</li>
    <li>9 p.m. is identified as the best time for sightings.</li>
    <li>Texas is noted as the worst state for UFO sightings.</li>
    <li>More reports have been logged in the last two years than in the previous 17 combined.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between 2020 and 2024, Illinois has seen a total of 558 UFO sightings. The study suggests a marked increase in reports over the last two years, indicating a growing interest or possibly increased awareness of UFO phenomena among the public.</p>

<p>The study highlights that April consistently emerges as the peak month for sightings, with reports typically peaking at 9 p.m. This pattern may inform future research and public interest in UFO sightings throughout the state.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Illinois is one of the worst states to spot a UFO, according to the study,” said Bill Flick, the author of the report. “The findings may surprise those who believe the state is a hotspot for extraterrestrial activity.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study's results contrast sharply with trends in states like Vermont, which has been identified as the best area for UFO sightings. This disparity raises questions about regional differences in sightings and public reporting practices. Moreover, the last two years have shown a significant uptick in reported sightings, surpassing totals from the previous 17 years combined, indicating a potential shift in public perception or reporting of UFOs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>UFO researchers and authorities are expected to continue monitoring sighting reports and analyzing patterns in Illinois. Further studies may be conducted to explore the reasons behind the low frequency of sightings in the state compared to others.</p>
