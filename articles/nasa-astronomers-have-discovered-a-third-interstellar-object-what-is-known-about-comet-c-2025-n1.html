      <h2>NASA astronomers have discovered a third interstellar object: what is known about comet C/2025 N1</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected a new interstellar object, designated as 3I/Atlas, on July 1 at an observatory in Chile. The object is currently over 670 million kilometers away from the Sun and moving at a speed of 60 km/s on a hyperbolic orbit.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/Atlas is likely the third known interstellar body to traverse the Solar System. Researchers have observed cometary activity from the object, including a faint coma and a short tail, leading to its additional designation as C/2025 N1. Scientists have noted that 3I/Atlas poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object detected: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Location of detection: Atlas telescope, Chile</li>
    <li>Current distance from the Sun: over 670 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed: 60 km/s</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2023, at a distance of 130 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated size: up to 20 km in diameter</li>
    <li>Visibility: Expected to be observable through amateur telescopes in late 2025 - early 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers detected the interstellar object 3I/Atlas using the Atlas telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, researchers noted cometary activity, including a faint coma and a short tail. The object is currently moving towards its closest approach to the Sun, expected on October 30, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Currently, it is not expected that the comet will be visible to the naked eye, but it can be seen through an amateur telescope in late 2025 - early 2026. As it is studied over the coming weeks, we will have a better understanding of how visible it will actually be,” said Jake Foster from the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas adds to the growing list of known interstellar objects. Previous interstellar bodies, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also garnered significant interest from the scientific community. This trend highlights the increasing ability of astronomers to detect and study objects from outside the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun. Further studies will provide more insights into its visibility and characteristics as it moves through the Solar System.</p>
