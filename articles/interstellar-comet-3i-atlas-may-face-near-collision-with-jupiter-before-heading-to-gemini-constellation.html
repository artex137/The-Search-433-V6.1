      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may face near-collision with Jupiter before heading to Gemini constellation</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is on a trajectory that will see it make a close encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026, before continuing toward the Gemini constellation. This marks the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the solar system, and experts have not yet confirmed its origin, though the direction of Sagittarius is a possibility.</p>

<p>This encounter with Jupiter is significant as it will be the comet's final major gravitational interaction before it exits the solar system. A new preprint study has modeled the comet's path, indicating that it will come very close to Jupiter's Hill radius, where the planet's gravitational influence is strongest. Researchers have noted that the comet's trajectory may change significantly due to Jupiter's gravity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to encounter Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The distance of the comet from Jupiter will be very close to the Hill radius of 0.355 astronomical units (au).</li>
    <li>The comet is projected to head towards the Gemini constellation after passing Jupiter.</li>
    <li>The optimal observation period for the comet is suggested to be from March 9 to March 22, 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet's internal activity has led to an unexpected increase in its speed and trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been identified as the third interstellar visitor to the solar system. Researchers have conducted simulations to model its path, suggesting a close encounter with Jupiter will occur on March 16, 2026. The comet is expected to leave the solar system and head towards the Gemini constellation after this encounter.</p>

<p>The team has indicated that the comet's movement has been influenced by outgassing and radiation pressure from the Sun, which has altered its predicted course. Observations are ongoing to gather more data on the comet’s characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet 3I will definitely suffer the perturbation from both Mars and Jupiter at their respective close approach epochs,” researchers stated regarding the gravitational influences on the comet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Chris Lintott, Professor of Astrophysics and Citizen Science Lead at the University of Oxford, noted, “[Comet 3I/ATLAS] is probably from an old star in the thick disc, and we think that it's likely that this thing's been out there for longer than the age of the Solar System.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in the solar system, following previous interstellar visitors. Continuous observations have allowed astronomers to identify the comet's characteristics and potential trajectory. The study of interstellar comets provides insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. Further observations are needed to confirm its trajectory and the effects of gravitational interactions. The optimal observation period in March 2026 is anticipated to provide valuable data on the comet's behaviour and characteristics.</p>
