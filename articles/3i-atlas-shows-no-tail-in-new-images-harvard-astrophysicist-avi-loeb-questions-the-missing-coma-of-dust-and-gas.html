      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shows No Tail In New Images</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has raised questions about the lack of a cometary tail in <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, an interstellar object first discovered in July 2025, after new post-perihelion images were released on November 5, 2025. The images, obtained via the <strong>Virtual Telescope Project</strong> in Italy, reveal that 3I/ATLAS does not display the expected gaseous plume typical of comets, which has puzzled astronomers and the public alike.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges current understanding of cometary behavior and raises discussions about the object's characteristics. Loeb has noted that the comet exhibits non-gravitational acceleration, suggesting that at least 13% of its mass must have evaporated. However, the recent images do not show evidence of this expected evaporation, leading to speculation about the object's nature and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Perihelion Images Released:</strong> November 5, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Source of Images:</strong> Virtual Telescope Project, Italy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025. Following its discovery, astronomers monitored its trajectory and characteristics. On November 5, 2025, new images were released showing the comet's lack of a visible tail, prompting discussions in the scientific community about its unusual behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, “For a typical comet, this should have resulted in a massive coma with dust and gas that would have been pushed by the solar radiation pressure and the solar wind to the shape of a typical cometary tail pointing away from the Sun.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Michael Merrifield, emeritus professor of astronomy at the University of Nottingham, commented on X/Twitter, “Avi Loeb now appending to his atrocious a posteriori statistics some fan mail likening him to Galileo. He really has entirely lost the plot.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS has drawn comparisons to other notable comets, such as the Great Comet of 1680, which exhibited typical cometary features. The scientific community remains divided on the implications of Loeb's claims regarding the object's potential artificial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers plan to conduct further observations to gather more data on its characteristics and behavior. These observations may provide additional insights into the comet’s composition and trajectory.</p>
