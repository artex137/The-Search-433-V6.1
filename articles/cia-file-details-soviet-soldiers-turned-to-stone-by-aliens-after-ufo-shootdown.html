      <h2>CIA file details Soviet soldiers 'turned to stone' by aliens after UFO shootdown</h2>

<p>A 1993 report from the former Soviet Union details an incident in which 23 military personnel were allegedly turned to stone by extraterrestrial beings after a UFO was shot down over Siberia. According to the accounts, a surface-to-air missile brought down an alien vessel, resulting in five entities emerging from the wreckage and transforming into a luminous sphere, which petrified the soldiers. Only a few survivors were left to recount the event.</p>

<p>This report, which has gained recent attention, raises concerns about the implications of advanced alien technology. The declassified CIA document references the incident, suggesting it could indicate a significant threat if such technology exists. The Soviet Union had publicly denied UFO sightings, labeling them as Western myths, yet newly disclosed documents show that the USSR was monitoring unusual aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in 1993 over Siberia.</li>
    <li>A total of 23 soldiers were reportedly turned to stone.</li>
    <li>Five extraterrestrial beings emerged from the downed craft.</li>
    <li>UFO remnants and petrified soldiers were moved to a classified facility near Moscow.</li>
    <li>Analysis revealed the soldiers' material matched limestone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The events unfolded as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In 1993, a surface-to-air missile shot down an unidentified flying object over Siberia.</li>
    <li>Five beings emerged from the wreckage and transformed into a luminous sphere.</li>
    <li>The sphere emitted a light beam that petrified 23 soldiers nearby.</li>
    <li>Reports maintain that two soldiers survived with reduced exposure.</li>
    <li>The petrified personnel were later transported to a classified research facility for analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If accurate, this incident would demonstrate the presence of exceptionally sophisticated alien technology presenting a considerable danger when antagonised,” the CIA document states.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The incident is part of a broader pattern of UFO sightings and claims of alien encounters during the Cold War. While the Soviet government publicly dismissed such reports, internal documents indicate that they were actively investigating these phenomena. For example, a notable entry from February 13, 1989, describes a massive airborne object observed above Nalchik, Russia, which remained suspended for over an hour.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the 1993 incident are not currently underway, and no official charges or inquiries have been announced regarding the claims of petrified soldiers or the downed UFO.</p>
