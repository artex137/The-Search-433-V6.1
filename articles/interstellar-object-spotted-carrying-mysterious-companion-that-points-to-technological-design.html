      <h2>Interstellar object spotted carrying mysterious companion that points to 'technological design'</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has been observed to have a hidden companion that could potentially collide with Mars within weeks, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The object, which is currently moving through our solar system, is projected to pass within 18 million miles of Mars on October 3, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery has raised significant interest among scientists and astronomers. Authorities are now closely monitoring the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and its companion, as any collision could provide valuable insights into its origins. Loeb's theory suggests that the object may be an extraterrestrial craft, prompting further investigation into its characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>Projected closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 18 million miles.</li>
    <li>Estimated size of possible companion probe: smaller than 330 feet (100 meters).</li>
    <li>Speed of 3I/ATLAS: approximately 40 miles per second (over 140,000 miles per hour).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth expected: December 17, 2025, within 223 million miles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, Hubble Space Telescope images indicated that 3I/ATLAS was generating its own light, leading to speculation about its nature. In September 2025, Avi Loeb published a paper theorizing that a precursor mini-probe may accompany 3I/ATLAS. This mini-probe could reach Mars a week before the comet's closest approach.</p>

<p>Observations of 3I/ATLAS have shown it to be five times brighter as it nears the sun. Calculations suggest that a small orbit correction could place the mini-probe on a collision course with Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "If 3I/ATLAS was a natural comet, any pieces breaking off it wouldn't have enough speed to travel the huge distance to Mars."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further explained, "It would take only a small orbit correction, a tweak in the object's speed and direction using thrusters or an engine, of about 6.2 to 9.3 miles per second this month to put the mini-probe on a collision course with Mars."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Avi Loeb has proposed extraordinary theories about 3I/ATLAS. Earlier in 2025, he suggested that the object could be a giant, nuclear-powered vessel. His claims have sparked debate within the scientific community regarding the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>Recent findings indicate that 3I/ATLAS is releasing approximately 940 trillion molecules of carbon dioxide per second, reinforcing its classification as a comet. However, there are discrepancies regarding its size, with NASA's telescopes estimating it to be only 1.7 miles long, significantly smaller than earlier estimates.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and its companion in the lead-up to their closest approaches to Mars and Earth. Further observations are expected to provide additional data on the object's characteristics and potential implications for future research.</p>
