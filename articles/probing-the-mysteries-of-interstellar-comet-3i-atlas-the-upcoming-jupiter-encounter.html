      <h2>Probing the Mysteries of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: The Upcoming Jupiter Encounter</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. The comet is currently on a trajectory toward Jupiter, with its closest approach expected on March 16, 2026.</p>

<p>The significance of this encounter lies in its potential to enhance our understanding of interstellar comets. Scientists aim to observe how the comet interacts with Jupiter's gravity, which could provide insights into its composition and structural integrity. Observations from spacecraft like ESA's Juice will capture these effects, although no direct intercept is planned due to the comet's high speed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): October 29, 2025, at 1.36 AU</li>
    <li>Passed Earth at 1.8 AU on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026, at approximately 0.36 AU</li>
    <li>Travel speed: Up to 68 km/s</li>
    <li>Visible in the pre-dawn sky, magnitude 12+</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was flagged by the ATLAS survey at a distance of 4.51 AU from the Sun. Precovery images indicate activity as early as May 7, 2025. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, and made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>
<p>As of late December 2025, the comet is approaching Jupiter, with key observations expected during its close pass in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This encounter promises to serve as a defining test of its interstellar behavior, potentially revealing insights into its structural resilience, compositional anomalies, and dynamical history through perturbations and induced activity,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its discovery contributes to a limited sample of interstellar objects, aiding scientists in understanding the formation of planets and comets around distant stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches Jupiter, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. The outcomes of the Jupiter encounter may resolve ongoing debates about the comet's origins and characteristics, with further observations expected to clarify its nature.</p>
