      <h2>Where Is the Comet's Tail? Loeb Raises Red Flag as Luna Demands Answers on 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Concerns surrounding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS have intensified after astronomers reported its unusual lack of a cometary tail. The object was observed on 5 November 2025, prompting questions from researchers, including Avi Loeb, about its true nature.</p>

<p>The absence of a typical comet tail has led to calls for clarification from both the scientific community and political figures. Representative Anna Paulina Luna has expressed her support for Loeb's findings and has confirmed that NASA plans to release additional data about 3I/ATLAS once government operations resume.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation Date: 5 November 2025</li>
    <li>Notable Characteristics: Lacks a visible comet tail</li>
    <li>Current Status: Awaiting further data from NASA</li>
    <li>Key Figures: Avi Loeb, Anna Paulina Luna</li>
    <li>Acceleration Measurements: 1.1 x 10<sup>-6</sup> au per day² (radial), 3.7 x 10<sup>-7</sup> au per day² (transverse)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object, sparking curiosity among astronomers. On 21 July 2025, initial observations were made using the Hubble Space Telescope. By November 5, 2025, updated images revealed the object’s distinctive characteristics, including its lack of a comet tail.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the object’s behaviour, noting that its mass fraction loss during perihelion should have resulted in a visible tail. Meanwhile, Representative Luna has engaged with NASA to discuss the object and its data dissemination.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Dr. Avi Loeb... was correct in his early analysis of the abnormal tail. NASA has also noted this.” — Representative Anna Paulina Luna
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The peculiar characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have prompted comparisons to prior interstellar objects, such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which exhibited more typical cometary features. The ongoing debate highlights the evolving understanding of celestial bodies and their classifications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to release more images and data about 3I/ATLAS once the government reopens. The scientific community continues to analyze the object’s features to determine its classification and implications for future astronomical studies.</p>
