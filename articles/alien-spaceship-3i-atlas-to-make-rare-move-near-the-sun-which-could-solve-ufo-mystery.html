      <h2>'Alien spaceship' 3I/Atlas to make rare move near the Sun which could solve UFO mystery</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is scheduled to reach a unique alignment with the Earth and Sun on January 22, 2026, according to astrophysicist Avi Loeb. This event could provide scientists with a rare opportunity to investigate the object, which has sparked debate over its origins, including speculation that it might be an alien spaceship.</p>

<p>This alignment, known as an opposition surge, will allow researchers to observe 3I/Atlas as it is illuminated from behind Earth. Loeb, a professor at Harvard University, emphasized the significance of this event for characterizing the comet's properties. He stated that understanding the composition and structure of 3I/Atlas could have implications for our knowledge of interstellar matter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: January 22, 2026</li>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Alignment angle: 0.69 degrees</li>
    <li>Observation period: January 19–26, 2026</li>
    <li>Key researcher: Prof. Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas will achieve a near-opposition alignment with the Earth and Sun on January 22, 2026. This alignment will last approximately one week, allowing for extensive observation of the comet.</p>

<p>Loeb has called for coordinated observations from multiple sites to gather high-precision data during this period. He suggests that scientists should monitor the comet for four days before and after the alignment to maximize data collection.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Observations before and after the alignment time offer an unprecedented opportunity which may not repeat for decades, for characterizing the albedo, structure, and composition of interstellar matter." 
    — Prof. Avi Loeb
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "When the Sun, object, and observer are nearly aligned, shadows cast by dust particles are hidden behind the particles. This eliminates dark areas, increasing the object’s brightness." 
    — Prof. Avi Loeb
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/Atlas has intensified in recent months, with some scientists suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft. Loeb has previously published papers discussing the comet's unique features and the implications of its dust composition.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of opposition surge is not new, but the specific conditions surrounding 3I/Atlas are expected to yield significant data that could clarify its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are preparing for the observation period beginning January 19, 2026, and will coordinate efforts to collect and analyze data on 3I/Atlas. This research may provide insights into the characteristics of interstellar comets and their dust composition.</p>
