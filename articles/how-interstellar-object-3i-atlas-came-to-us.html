      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Traced Back 10 Million Years</h2>
<p>A team of scientists led by Xabier Pérez-Couto from the University of A Coruña, Spain, has traced the path of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS back 10 million years. The comet is one of only three known interstellar objects that have approached our solar system, having originated from a different star system. The researchers are investigating the comet's origin and the stars that may have influenced its trajectory.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances our understanding of the formation of solar systems and the distribution of icy planetesimals in the galaxy. The findings could provide insights into the processes that govern the evolution of planetary systems. The scientists aim to identify the origin of 3I/ATLAS to better understand the dynamics of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system.</li>
    <li>It was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Minor Planet Center confirmed its interstellar nature on July 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be traveling at approximately 210,000 kilometers per hour (130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>Initial size estimates indicated a diameter of about 20 km (12 miles), which has since been revised to 5.6 km (3.5 miles).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has been found to contain abundant water ice and has a dust composition similar to D-type asteroids.</li>
    <li>The researchers published their findings on arXiv on September 10, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS system detected 3I/ATLAS, marking the beginning of its journey into public knowledge. The following day, the Minor Planet Center confirmed it as an interstellar object. Over the next two months, scientists utilized data from various observatories, including the Gaia space observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope, to analyze its trajectory and size.</p>
<p>By late July, revised estimates of the comet's diameter emerged, indicating it could be as small as 320 meters (1,050 feet). Researchers have since traced 3I/ATLAS's path back through the galaxy, identifying 93 nominal encounters with stars, none of which significantly altered its path.</p>
<p>On September 10, 2025, the research team published their findings, which have not yet been peer-reviewed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Identifying the origin of interstellar objects is key to understanding planet formation efficiency, the distribution of volatiles and organics in the galaxy, and the dynamical pathways by which planetary systems evolve,” said Pérez-Couto.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins two previous interstellar visitors: 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These objects have sparked interest in understanding the processes that lead to the formation of solar systems. The study of interstellar objects helps scientists comprehend the dynamics of material ejected from star systems, contributing to our knowledge of the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data on 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory. The European Space Agency's Comet Interceptor mission is set to target future interstellar objects, although no specific mission for 3I/ATLAS has been planned. Further studies will focus on understanding the composition and origins of the comet.</p>
