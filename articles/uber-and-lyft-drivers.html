      <h2>Uber and Lyft drivers</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS is approaching the sun, offering scientists a rare opportunity to observe an object from outside our solar system. The comet, discovered by NASA in July, is expected to reach its closest point to the sun by late October. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its rarity, as it is only the third known object from outside the solar system to pass through. Scientists aim to study its composition as it approaches the sun, which will cause more of its material to turn into gas. The University of California, Santa Cruz has initiated a program called Shadow the Scientists to engage the public in real-time scientific observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered by NASA in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to the sun is in late October 2023.</li>
    <li>Only the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Shadow the Scientists program allows public participation in observing the comet.</li>
    <li>Upcoming public sessions on September 25 and late November 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, NASA first discovered the comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, scientists have been monitoring its trajectory as it approaches the sun. As the comet gets closer, it will shed more material, allowing for detailed studies of its composition.</p>

<p>On September 25, 2023, the Shadow the Scientists program will hold a session dedicated to 3I/ATLAS. Additional sessions are planned for late November 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This kind of sensationalism ends up ultimately... causing people to lose faith in more serious, evidence-based research and science. Not just in astronomy, this happens in every field,” said Raja GuhaThakurta, faculty director at UC Santa Cruz.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Could this be something that aliens — another civilization — sent to us? That has been starting a conversation,” said Jameeka Marshall, who runs the Shadow the Scientists program.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Shadow the Scientists program was started in 2020 to enhance public engagement with scientific research. It aims to demystify the process of evidence-based science and combat sensationalism surrounding astronomical phenomena.</p>

<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects have been identified, making this event particularly noteworthy for astronomers and the public alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the sun, scientists will continue to study its composition. The Shadow the Scientists program will provide updates and educational opportunities during its upcoming sessions in September and November.</p>
