      <h2>The Mysterious Object Heading Towards The Solar System Just Changed Its Color</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed a change in color of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Initially spotted with a reddish hue, the comet has now taken on a greenish tint, according to long-exposure images captured in Namibia during the recent lunar eclipse.</p>

<p>This color change is significant for scientists studying interstellar objects and their behavior. Astronomers are investigating the reasons behind the shift, with leading theories suggesting it may be linked to the release of cyanide gas as the comet heats up. The change offers a unique opportunity to understand cosmic chemistry and the characteristics of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted with a reddish hue.</li>
    <li>It has changed to a greenish tint as it approaches the Sun.</li>
    <li>Long-exposure images were taken in Namibia during a lunar eclipse.</li>
    <li>Initial studies indicate the comet is nearly 90% carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>Deep imaging on September 7, 2025, shows the comet's green glow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified with a reddish color, which later transitioned to green as it moved closer to the Sun. The transformation was documented through long-exposure photography during the lunar eclipse, prompting further investigation by astronomers.</p>

<p>Initial studies have indicated that the comet is rich in carbon dioxide, which may be influencing its color change. Astronomers are continuing to monitor the comet's behavior and composition as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, suggested that the change in color could be tied to a spike in cyanide emissions. He stated, "Cyanide tends to glow green under solar radiation." </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS is important for understanding the diversity of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. Previous visitors, such as Borisov and ?Oumuamua, have raised questions about the nature of these objects, and 3I/ATLAS may provide further insights into their behavior and composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, analyzing its composition and behavior to gain a deeper understanding of interstellar comets and their interactions with solar radiation.</p>
