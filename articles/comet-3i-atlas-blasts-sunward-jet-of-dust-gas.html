      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Blasts Sunward Jet of Dust & Gas</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has produced a powerful jet of material pointing directly towards the Sun, as captured by the Two-meter Twin Telescope at Teide Observatory in the Canary Islands. This event occurred in late October 2025, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant because it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study materials from outside our solar system. The comet's activity as it approaches the Sun offers insights into its structure and composition, particularly its unusually high levels of carbon dioxide relative to water in its coma.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object.</li>
    <li>The jet may span up to <strong>10,000 km</strong> (approximately <strong>6,200 miles</strong>) in length.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate high levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) relative to water (H₂O).</li>
    <li>Perihelion approach is expected around late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Ground- and space-based telescopes are targeting the comet for further study.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed to produce a striking jet of dust and gas as it nears the Sun. The Two-meter Twin Telescope at Teide Observatory captured the image of this activity, revealing the comet's icy core and the jet directed towards our star.</p>

<p>As the comet moves closer to the Sun, its surface heats unevenly, leading to the release of gases and dust. This process creates jets, which are a normal response for comets as they approach solar heat.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The vivid sunward jet of 3I/ATLAS is both visually striking and scientifically rich,” a representative from the observatory stated. “It underscores how this visitor from another star system behaves in a manner fundamentally similar to – yet intriguingly different from – solar-system comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third confirmed object from beyond our solar system. Its unique characteristics provide a comparison point for understanding the composition and behavior of interstellar materials relative to those found in our solar neighborhood.</p>

<p>The presence of a sunward jet is consistent with the behavior of comets as they approach the Sun, although the specific composition of 3I/ATLAS differs from typical solar-system comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS nears perihelion, scientists expect its activity to increase. Ground- and space-based telescopes will continue to monitor the comet for further data on its structure and evolution under solar heating.</p>
