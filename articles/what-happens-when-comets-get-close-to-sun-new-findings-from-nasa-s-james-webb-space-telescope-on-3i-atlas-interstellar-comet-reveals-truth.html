      <h2>What happens when comets get close to sun? New findings from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope on 3I/ATLAS interstellar comet reveals truth</h2>

<p>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has provided new insights into the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing important details about its behavior as it approaches the sun. The findings were announced on <strong>October 27, 2023</strong>, and no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances our understanding of cometary activity and the effects of solar proximity on these celestial bodies. NASA scientists are now analyzing the data to further comprehend the implications of these findings on future comet studies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>New findings were announced on October 27, 2023.</li>
    <li>Research conducted by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities reported.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in 2019. It has since been monitored as it journeys through the solar system. The latest observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have provided critical data regarding its composition and behavior.</p>

<p>The comet's approach to the sun has raised questions about the effects of solar radiation on its structure and activity. Scientists have been working to analyze these effects since the comet's discovery.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The findings from the James Webb Space Telescope will help us understand how comets behave when they get close to the sun,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This knowledge is crucial for future explorations and studies.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies of comets have indicated that solar proximity can lead to significant changes in their composition and activity levels. The behavior of 3I/ATLAS may provide insights that could inform future missions to other comets and celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue analyzing data from the James Webb Space Telescope to draw further conclusions about comet 3I/ATLAS and its journey through the solar system. Additional findings are expected to be released in the coming months.</p>
