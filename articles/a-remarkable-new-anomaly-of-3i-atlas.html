      <h2>A Remarkable New Anomaly of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On November 22, 2025, astronomers have noted a significant anomaly regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is set to reach its closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026. The findings suggest that the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS has been altered by non-gravitational forces, potentially indicating a technological origin.</p>

<p>This anomaly matters because it challenges existing understandings of celestial mechanics and could imply that 3I/ATLAS has been fine-tuned to approach Jupiter within its gravitational influence. Authorities, including NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), are analyzing data from approximately 230 observatories to confirm these findings and assess the implications for future interstellar object studies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Closest approach date:</strong> March 16, 2026</li>
  <li><strong>Distance from Jupiter:</strong> 53.445 million kilometers (± 0.06 million kilometers)</li>
  <li><strong>Jupiter-Sun separation on approach:</strong> 783.8 million kilometers</li>
  <li><strong>Non-gravitational acceleration measured:</strong> 5 x 10<sup>-7</sup> au per day squared</li>
  <li><strong>Data sources:</strong> NASA's JPL and 230 observatories</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been monitored since its discovery, with its trajectory being calculated based on data obtained from multiple observatories. The significant measurements of non-gravitational acceleration were recorded during its perihelion passage, leading to the current predictions about its trajectory toward Jupiter.</p>

<p>On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS is expected to arrive at a distance that aligns closely with Jupiter’s Hill radius, a critical zone where Jupiter's gravity dominates over that of the Sun. This alignment suggests a potential intentional adjustment of its path, raising questions about the object's origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The near coincidence of the Hill radius and the minimum distance from Jupiter suggests a finely tuned trajectory, which is intriguing,” said Avi Loeb, an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this observation, 3I/ATLAS had been regarded primarily as a natural celestial body. The current findings introduce a new layer of complexity to the study of interstellar objects, as they may imply the existence of advanced technology beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing investigations will focus on further analyzing the trajectory and acceleration of 3I/ATLAS. Scientists aim to determine whether the changes in its path are indeed a result of non-gravitational forces or other phenomena, with results expected as the object approaches Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
