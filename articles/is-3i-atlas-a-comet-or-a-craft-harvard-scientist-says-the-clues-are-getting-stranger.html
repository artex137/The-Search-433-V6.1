      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS a comet or a craft? Harvard scientist says the clues are getting stranger</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has raised questions about Comet 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may not be a typical comet but rather an artificial object. His remarks came during a recent discussion at an astronomy conference held in New York City, where he presented his findings on the comet's unusual features.</p>

<p>This inquiry is significant as it challenges the conventional understanding of comets and their origins. Loeb's research has prompted interest from various scientific communities and space agencies, which are now considering further investigations into the comet's nature and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in 2019.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a professor of science at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>The discussion took place at an astronomy conference in New York City.</li>
    <li>Loeb has suggested the comet exhibits features inconsistent with typical comet behavior.</li>
    <li>No immediate follow-up missions have been announced by space agencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2019, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered and attracted attention due to its unusual trajectory. In recent months, Avi Loeb has conducted a series of studies on the comet, culminating in his presentation at the astronomy conference in New York City. His assertions about the potential artificial nature of the comet have sparked debate within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The evidence suggests that we may be dealing with something far beyond a simple comet,” said Avi Loeb during his presentation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding Comet 3I/ATLAS comes in light of previous observations of interstellar objects, including 'Oumuamua, which also raised questions about the origins of celestial bodies. Loeb's theories contribute to ongoing debates about the nature of unidentified objects in space and the existence of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further studies and discussions are expected within the scientific community as researchers analyze data related to Comet 3I/ATLAS. No specific plans for additional missions or investigations have been disclosed at this time.</p>
