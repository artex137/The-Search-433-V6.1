      <h2>America's nuclear sites secretly invaded by thousands of UFOs, new report reveals</h2>

<p>Thousands of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have reportedly invaded America's most sensitive nuclear sites over the past eight decades, according to a new report from the crowdsourced platform Enigma. The report, published on January 24, 2026, reveals more than 2,800 unidentified aerial sightings over 90 US nuclear plants and military facilities.</p>

<p>This report raises significant concerns regarding national security and airspace violations. Authorities, including the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, are tasked with investigating these sightings, although they have not confirmed any physical evidence of extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>More than 2,800 UFO sightings reported over or near US nuclear sites.</li>
    <li>Over 1,800 sightings near nuclear power plants; more than 1,000 at military nuclear weapons sites.</li>
    <li>Recent notable sighting occurred in April 2025 near Bear, Delaware.</li>
    <li>Witnesses have described objects as glowing orbs, disks, and triangles.</li>
    <li>Significant clusters of sightings reported in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Florida.</li>
    <li>Many sightings occurred during a drone surge from November 2024 to February 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Reports of UFO sightings near US nuclear sites date back to the late 1940s, coinciding with the early years of the US nuclear program. Witnesses have reported bright green fireballs near Kirtland and Sandia Air Force Bases in New Mexico.</p>
<p>In 1967, multiple nuclear missiles were reportedly disabled during UFO encounters over Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. More recent sightings include glowing objects observed during the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the 2011 Fukushima accident.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If these objects belong to foreign intelligence or advanced programs, they expose vulnerabilities in national defense,” Enigma researchers stated. “If they are something unknown to science, they may represent new physics or technology. Either possibility demands improved detection, data sharing, and protective measures.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The report highlights a historical trend of UFO sightings near nuclear facilities. Enigma Labs has documented over 1,800 sightings near 53 nuclear power plants and 1,000 incidents at 37 military bases linked to nuclear weapons research.</p>
<p>Many reports describe objects hovering or disappearing suddenly, raising questions about airspace security and the potential implications for national defense.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into these sightings are ongoing, with authorities emphasizing the need for improved detection and protective measures at sensitive sites. Further analysis and data sharing are expected to follow as the situation develops.</p>
