      <h2>How Far are Aliens From Earth? Here's What a New Study Revealed</h2>

<p>A new study presented at the Europlanet Science Congress and the Division for Planetary Science (EPSC-DPS) in Helsinki in September 2025 has suggested that intelligent aliens may exist, but they could be as far as 33,000 light-years from Earth. The research was conducted by Manuel Scherf and Helmut Lammer from the Austrian Academy of Sciences. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to the study.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it raises questions about the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence and the implications of recent UFO sightings. Authorities and scientists are now emphasizing the need for ongoing search efforts, such as those conducted by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study presented in September 2025 at the Europlanet Science Congress in Helsinki.</li>
    <li>Conducted by Manuel Scherf and Helmut Lammer of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.</li>
    <li>Advanced extraterrestrial life may be located up to 33,000 light-years away.</li>
    <li>Aliens would need to survive for at least 280,000 years for potential contact with humans.</li>
    <li>Life-bearing planets must last billions of years and have a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 2025, researchers presented their study during the Europlanet Science Congress in Helsinki. They compared planetary lifespans with the evolution of advanced life. The findings indicated that potential extraterrestrial civilizations could exist far beyond humanity's current reach.</p>

<p>In the same month, multiple UFO sightings were reported, including a missile fired at an unidentified aerial object in Shandong province, China, and large lights flying in formation near Tulcingo de Valle, Mexico.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Although ETIs might be rare, there is only one way to really find out, and that is by searching for it,” said Manuel Scherf. “If these searches find nothing, it makes our theory more likely, and if SETI does find something, then it will be one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs ever achieved, as we would know that we are not alone in the universe.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“At some point, enough carbon dioxide will be drawn from the atmosphere so that photosynthesis will stop working. For the Earth, that's expected to happen in about 200 million to roughly one billion years,” Scherf added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Recent UFO and UAP sightings have sparked public interest and debate about the existence of extraterrestrial life. While the study indicates that alien life may be far away, these sightings continue to fuel fascination and speculation about unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers and authorities will continue to advocate for ongoing searches for extraterrestrial intelligence, emphasizing that even negative results contribute to scientific understanding. The implications of the study suggest a need for further investigation into both the conditions necessary for life and the ongoing reports of UFO sightings.</p>
