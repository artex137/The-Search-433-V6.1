      <h2>HiRISE Images of 3I/ATLAS Are Expected to be Released in a Few Days</h2>

<p>NASA is expected to release HiRISE images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS within a few days, with the announcement anticipated on November 14, 2025. The release follows a 43-day government shutdown that delayed access to the data.</p>

<p>The upcoming images are significant as they will provide a side view of the unique anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS, which has been observed to extend toward the Sun, contrary to typical cometary behavior. Scientists hope to determine the diameter of the nucleus based on the brightest pixel in the images, which will have a spatial resolution of approximately 30 kilometers per pixel.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images expected to be released on November 14, 2025.</li>
    <li>Previous image taken by Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS came within 29 million kilometers of Mars on October 2–3, 2025.</li>
    <li>HiRISE images will have a resolution three times better than Hubble's.</li>
    <li>Government shutdown lasted 43 days, delaying image release.</li>
    <li>C/2014 UN271, a larger object, is also approaching the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured a high-resolution image of 3I/ATLAS, revealing an unusual anti-tail. The object passed within 29 million kilometers of Mars on October 2–3, 2025. Following a prolonged government shutdown, NASA is set to release the HiRISE images on November 14, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The truth about the nature of 3I/ATLAS will be revealed by publicly shared data and not by any storyline of gatekeepers,” said Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of 3I/ATLAS has garnered attention due to its unusual anti-tail behavior, differing from typical cometary activity. Additionally, C/2014 UN271, discovered in 2014, is another significant object approaching the Sun, noted for being larger than Lake Erie and ten thousand times more massive than 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will release the HiRISE images of 3I/ATLAS on November 14, 2025, which will enable further analysis and observations of the interstellar object.</p>
