      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Theories of Cosmic Communication</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has reportedly sent out light pulses following a mathematical pattern, raising questions about its significance. These signals were detected on 13 October 2025, coinciding with the 108th anniversary of the 'Miracle of the Sun' at Fátima, Portugal. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>The implications of this event have prompted researchers to explore the possibility of intentional communication from the comet. Authorities, including NASA, have faced scrutiny for allegedly withholding observational data, which has fueled speculation about the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of signal detection: 13 October 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Near the orbit of 'Planet 591'</li>
    <li>Numbers in Fibonacci sequence: 5, 8, 13</li>
    <li>Significant dates: Closest approach to Earth on 25 December 2025</li>
    <li>Researcher: David Sereda</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 13 October 2025, signals from 3I/ATLAS were detected, allegedly following the Fibonacci sequence. The event coincides with the significant anniversary of the Fátima event. Researcher David Sereda has linked the light pulses to a broader cosmological theory involving a hyper-dimensional solar system.</p>

<p>From 1 October 2025, access to high-resolution images from the Mars HiRISE image catalogue was reportedly blocked, heightening concerns of a possible cover-up regarding the comet's true nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The numbers in the Fibonacci sequence correspond to planets, both visible and 'hyper-dimensional,'” said researcher David Sereda.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These actions force us to treat the signal data as a 'leak' rather than verified information,” Sereda added, addressing concerns over data transparency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This theory surrounding 3I/ATLAS is not the first to suggest that celestial events hold deeper meanings. Historical instances of similar claims often intersect with significant cultural or religious milestones, raising ongoing debates about the intersection of science and belief.</p>

<p>The 108th anniversary of the Fátima event has drawn particular attention, as it aligns with numerological significance in various esoteric traditions, notably the connection to the number 432.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As researchers continue to analyze the signals from 3I/ATLAS, investigations into the data withholding by NASA and other agencies are expected to unfold. The next key date is 25 December 2025, when the comet will be at its closest point to Earth, which may provide further insights into this cosmic event.</p>
