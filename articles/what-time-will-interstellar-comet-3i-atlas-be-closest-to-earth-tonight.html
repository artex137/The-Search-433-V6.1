      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to Pass Closest to Earth Tonight</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth early on Friday, December 19, at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT). The comet will be approximately 1.8 astronomical units away, roughly 168 million miles (270 million kilometers), which is nearly twice the average distance between Earth and the sun. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it offers astronomers a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object detected passing through our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The flyby allows scientists to examine material formed around another star, providing insights into planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT)</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 1.8 astronomical units (168 million miles or 270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2023, by NASA-funded ATLAS telescopes in Chile</li>
    <li>Interstellar objects detected: 3 (including 3I/ATLAS, 'Oumuamua, and 2I/Borisov)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescopes in Chile. Since its discovery, astronomers have tracked its trajectory and calculated its closest approach to Earth. The comet is set to reach this point on December 19, 2023, at 1 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a livestream of the comet's approach, starting at 11 p.m. EST on December 18, 2023, allowing skywatchers to observe the event online.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Studying 3I/ATLAS near its closest approach provides astronomers with their best opportunity to examine material formed around another star,” said a representative from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is part of a rare group of interstellar objects that have been observed in our solar system. The previous interstellar objects, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also provided valuable data for scientists studying the formation and composition of planetary systems beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the closest approach, astronomers will analyze data collected during the flyby, which may lead to new insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
