      <h2>3I/ATLAS Exposed: The 'Ego Shattering' Reason The Interstellar Visitor Just Ignored Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS passed Earth on 19 December 2025, garnering global attention as it reached its closest approach. Astronomers and skywatchers tracked the comet, which is only the third known interstellar object detected, but it delivered an uneventful flyby, challenging prior expectations.</p>

<p>This event matters because it raises questions about humanity's place in the universe and the nature of interstellar objects. Authorities and scientists have analyzed the flyby data, noting the comet's expected behaviour and dismissing claims of artificial origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date of closest approach: 19 December 2025</li>
<li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million kilometres)</li>
<li>First detected: 1 July 2025 by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
<li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
<li>Instruments used for observation: Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, NASA's Parker Solar Probe</li>
<li>Next expected close approach: Jupiter in March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025. Observers monitored its trajectory as it approached Earth throughout the year. On 19 December 2025, it made its closest pass, approximately 270 million kilometres away, allowing for detailed scientific observation but no dramatic visual display.</p>
<p>Following its flyby, the comet continued its journey deeper into the solar system and is expected to pass Jupiter in March 2026, where its trajectory will be slightly altered by the planet's gravity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“How can anyone claim to be an expert of interstellar objects when the sample size includes only two previously known examples?” - Professor Avi Loeb, Harvard Center for Astrophysics</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS sparked speculation on social media regarding its nature, with some suggesting it could be an artificial object. However, astronomers noted that its characteristics fell within known comet behaviour. Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also prompted debate but were ultimately classified as natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected during the flyby and monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves towards Jupiter. The findings may offer further insights into interstellar comets and their behaviour.</p>
