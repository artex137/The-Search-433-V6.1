      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Not an Alien Spacecraft, NASA Confirms</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS is a natural interstellar comet, dismissing recent claims that it is an alien spacecraft. The comet was officially identified in 2024 and is currently traveling through space at a speed of 210,000 km/h.</p>

<p>The claims regarding comet 3I/ATLAS being an alien probe have circulated on social media and various online platforms. These theories have included references to a "mothership" and the "Galactic Federation." NASA has stated that there is no scientific evidence supporting these assertions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has a nucleus approximately 5.6 km in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet emits hydroxyl, a common by-product of water when heated by solar radiation.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object recorded by NASA, following Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits typical behavior such as dust release and tail formation.</li>
    <li>Nasa has released data confirming the comet's natural characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2024, NASA identified comet 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar comet. Subsequent to this discovery, various conspiracy theories emerged online, suggesting the comet was an alien spacecraft. These claims intensified in September 2025, prompting NASA to clarify the comet's nature.</p>
<p>NASA emphasized that the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS align with known cometary behavior, countering the narrative of it being an artificial object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The hypothesis that the comet is an alien spacecraft has no scientific basis,” a NASA spokesperson said. “These theories are speculative and do not reflect the data we have gathered.” 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time astronomical discoveries have been misrepresented as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Previous claims have included false assertions about the James Webb telescope detecting a giant spacecraft and other alleged UFO sightings. These narratives often exploit public fascination with the unknown but lack scientific credibility.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS and provide updates based on ongoing observations. The agency remains committed to educating the public about the nature of celestial bodies and combating misinformation.</p>
