      <h2>"I Thought It Was a UFO at First Glance": The True Identity of the Clouds Over the Skies Near Seoraksan</h2>

<p>Last weekend, unique clouds resembling a UFO appeared in the skies over the Yeongbuk region of Gangwon Province, drawing significant attention. On January 31, flat and smooth clouds were observed in Sokcho City and Yangyang County, with no other clouds present in the clear sky.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is noteworthy as it highlights the occurrence of lenticular clouds, which form under specific weather conditions and mountainous terrain. Authorities, including the Korea Meteorological Administration, have provided explanations about the nature and implications of these clouds, emphasizing their effect on aviation safety.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on January 31, 2026.</li>
    <li>Lenticular clouds observed in Sokcho City and Yangyang County, Gangwon Province.</li>
    <li>Clouds formed near Seoraksan National Park.</li>
    <li>Forecast analyst Kong Sangmin from the Korea Meteorological Administration provided insights.</li>
    <li>Lenticular clouds can pose risks to aviation safety.</li>
    <li>Historical reference: BOAC Flight 911 crash in 1966 linked to lenticular clouds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 31, 2026, observers noted the appearance of lenticular clouds in the clear skies above the Yeongbuk region. These clouds, shaped like saucers, were unique due to the lack of other cloud formations.</p>

<p>The Korea Meteorological Administration later explained that lenticular clouds form when specific weather conditions coincide with mountainous terrain, such as that found in Seoraksan. The air currents create a wave-like motion, resulting in these distinctive cloud shapes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "When the air is stable and strong winds blow over a mountain, the air can be lifted and cooled, forming saucer-shaped lenticular clouds," said Kong Sangmin, a forecast analyst at the Korea Meteorological Administration.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "They are the result of terrain and weather conditions occurring simultaneously," Kong added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Lenticular clouds are more commonly observed in regions with significant terrain, such as the Yeongbuk area and Jeju Island. This phenomenon often occurs in clear weather, adding to its mysterious appearance. However, despite their visual appeal, these clouds can create dangerous conditions for aircraft due to associated turbulence.</p>

<p>The 1966 crash of BOAC Flight 911 serves as a historical example of the potential dangers posed by lenticular clouds, as the aircraft encountered severe turbulence linked to these formations shortly before the accident.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to monitor weather patterns and educate the public about the nature of lenticular clouds. There are no immediate investigations or actions planned, but ongoing assessments of aviation safety protocols in relation to these phenomena are expected.</p>
