      <h2>Catholic filmmaker investigates UFO mysteries at the Vatican</h2>

<p>VATICAN CITY — Catholic filmmaker Sam Sorich has launched a documentary project to investigate claims that the Vatican possesses evidence of non-human intelligence, following allegations made by former CIA official David Grusch. The documentary, titled "Age of Disclosure," aims to explore these claims and their implications for the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>This investigation comes as interest in UFOs has intensified, drawing the attention of U.S. lawmakers and the public. Sorich seeks to provide a Catholic perspective on the controversy, emphasizing the importance of addressing such claims within the Church.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: "Age of Disclosure"</li>
    <li>Filmmaker: Sam Sorich</li>
    <li>Location of filming: San Oreste, Italy</li>
    <li>Key figure: Former CIA official David Grusch</li>
    <li>Allegation: Pope Pius XII had knowledge of a UFO crash in 1933</li>
    <li>Release date of Sorich's film: Expected in late 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, David Grusch testified before Congress, alleging that Pope Pius XII was aware of a UFO crash near Milan in 1933 and communicated information to the U.S. government. Sorich began filming his documentary on October 31, 2025, in San Oreste, where he explored a military bunker associated with the alleged technology of the craft.</p>

<p>On November 25, Sorich received an email from former Vatican Observatory director Jesuit Brother Guy Consolmagno, stating that the observatory avoids discussing UFOs due to the topic's controversial nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “A film like 'Age of Disclosure' is going to have a massive cultural impact, and the Catholic response should happen at every level,” said Sam Sorich.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The subject of UFOs... is a very touchy one. Most everything done about them is tainted badly by the charlatans who have poisoned the topic,” stated Brother Guy Consolmagno.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions surrounding UFOs within the Vatican have garnered media attention but have often been dismissed as non-serious. Sorich’s documentary aims to confront the stigma associated with UFO discussions and provide a platform for credible voices within the Church.</p>

<p>He has engaged with various theologians and Catholic individuals who have reported UFO sightings, seeking to gather a wide range of perspectives on the matter.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Sorich plans to continue filming and investigating the claims surrounding the Vatican's alleged knowledge of UFOs. He is considering a follow-up trip to further explore the topic and engage with experts in the field.</p>
