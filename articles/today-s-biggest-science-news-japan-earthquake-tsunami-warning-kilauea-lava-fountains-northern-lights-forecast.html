      <h2>Japan Issues Tsunami Warning Following 7.6 Magnitude Earthquake</h2>
<p>A magnitude 7.6 earthquake has struck off the northeastern coast of Japan's main island, Honshu, at 11:15 p.m. local time on December 8, 2025. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued tsunami warnings for three regions: the central Pacific Coast of Hokkaido, the Pacific Coast of Aomori Prefecture, and Iwate Prefecture. There are currently no reports of injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This earthquake has raised significant concerns regarding potential tsunami impacts. The expected maximum tsunami height is between 1 and 3 meters (3.2 to 9.8 feet). Authorities are monitoring the situation closely, and the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center has confirmed that a tsunami is not expected for California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, or Alaska.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Earthquake magnitude:</strong> 7.6</li>
    <li><strong>Time of earthquake:</strong> 11:15 p.m. local time (9:15 a.m. EST)</li>
    <li><strong>Regions under tsunami warning:</strong> Hokkaido, Aomori Prefecture, Iwate Prefecture</li>
    <li><strong>Expected tsunami height:</strong> 1 to 3 meters (3.2 to 9.8 feet)</li>
    <li><strong>Seismic intensity:</strong> 6+ in Hachinohe City</li>
    <li><strong>U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center statement:</strong> No tsunami expected in the U.S. West Coast and Alaska</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The earthquake struck at 11:15 p.m. local time, causing immediate concern among residents and officials. The Japan Meteorological Agency quickly issued tsunami warnings for the affected regions. By 9:32 a.m. EST, the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center confirmed that a tsunami was not expected for the U.S. West Coast and Alaska.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The seismic intensity in Hachinohe City was rated at 6+, indicating it is impossible to remain standing or to move without crawling,” said a representative from the Japan Meteorological Agency.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This earthquake is part of an ongoing pattern of seismic activity in the region. Japan sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plate movements frequently cause earthquakes. Authorities have heightened preparedness measures in response to such natural disasters due to the potential for significant damage and loss of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor seismic activity and tsunami developments closely. Emergency response teams are on standby in the affected regions, ready to assist if needed. Further assessments will take place to evaluate any potential damage from the earthquake.</p>
