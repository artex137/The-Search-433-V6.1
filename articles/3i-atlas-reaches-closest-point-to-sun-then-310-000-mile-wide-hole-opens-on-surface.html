      <h2>3I/ATLAS reaches closest point to sun—then 310,000 mile wide hole opens on surface</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its closest point to the sun, resulting in the formation of a 310,000-mile-wide hole on its surface, according to reports. This event occurred during its perihelion, which took place on a date not disclosed.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it provides new insights into the behavior of comets as they approach the sun. Researchers and scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to understand the implications of this phenomenon on its trajectory and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on a date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>A 310,000-mile-wide hole has formed on its surface.</li>
    <li>This event has attracted attention from researchers and scientists.</li>
    <li>The comet's behavior is being closely monitored.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed since its discovery, with recent observations indicating its approach towards the sun. The closest point to the sun, or perihelion, has now resulted in a notable change in its surface structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This event allows us to gain a better understanding of comet behavior and its interactions with solar radiation,” said a spokesperson from the scientific community.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets have previously shown similar behaviors when approaching the sun, often resulting in changes to their structure. The study of these phenomena is crucial for understanding the dynamics of comets and their potential effects on surrounding celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the sun, gathering data to analyze the impact of the hole on its trajectory and physical characteristics.</p>
