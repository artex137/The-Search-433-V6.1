      <h2>How 200 sailors saw 'fiery UFO orb' above ship… & it's never been explained</h2>

<p>Approximately 200 sailors have reported witnessing a glowing orange orb hovering above the USS Ronald Reagan, a US Navy aircraft carrier, in early 2004 off the East Coast. The object, estimated to be 12 metres wide, remained visible for about four hours, but no official explanation has been provided for the sighting.</p>

<p>This incident has gained renewed attention as documentary filmmaker Dave C. Beaty investigates the claims of the sailors. He has interviewed numerous witnesses who insist the object was an unidentified flying object (UFO). Beaty is urging more sailors to come forward with information, as he believes their accounts are crucial to understanding the event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in early 2004.</li>
    <li>Witnesses include Seaman Patrick Gokey and former Navy quartermaster Karol Olesiak.</li>
    <li>The orb hovered above the ship for approximately four hours starting around 8 PM.</li>
    <li>Beaty believes many more sailors witnessed the event.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon has faced criticism for its handling of UFO sightings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early 2004, sailors aboard the USS Ronald Reagan spotted a glowing orange orb above the flight deck. The orb reportedly hovered for about four hours, from around 8 PM. Witnesses described the object as not moving like any known aircraft and claimed it exhibited unusual speed.</p>

<p>After the sighting, some sailors reported that their attempts to document the encounter in the ship's log were discouraged by senior officers. Accounts of the event have varied, with some witnesses recalling different times and durations.</p>

<p>Beaty has spent years piecing together the timeline of the encounter, suggesting that the ship's log and command summary report could help narrow down the exact date of the sighting.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I can still visualise this object in my head to a tee regardless of 18 years having passed. All I know is it was something I could not explain.” 
    — Seaman Patrick Gokey
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It’s hard to believe somebody would be sitting on it for this long.” 
    — Former Navy quartermaster Karol Olesiak
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I do believe the government knows more than what they lead us to believe.” 
    — Derek Smith, former Boatswain’s Mate Seaman
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting is part of a broader pattern of UFO reports among US servicemen. Beaty noted that similar glowing objects have been documented in other military encounters. The Pentagon established the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office in 2022 to investigate unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), yet many sightings remain unexplained.</p>

<p>Between May 2023 and June 2024, US authorities received 757 reports of UAPs, including 272 historical sightings. Despite extensive investigations, the Pentagon has stated that no evidence of extraterrestrial beings has been found.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Beaty continues to seek out sailors who witnessed the event to gather more information. As discussions about UAPs gain traction in Washington, the Pentagon is under pressure to improve its investigations and address the growing concerns surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
