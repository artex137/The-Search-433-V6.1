      <h2>Sorry, but interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS really is a comet, not aliens</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, currently concealed from view behind the sun, has sparked speculation about its nature, with some claiming it could be an alien spacecraft. However, experts have dismissed these claims, stating that there is no evidence to support such assertions.</p>

<p>This clarification matters as it helps prevent the spread of misinformation about astronomical phenomena. Authorities and astronomers continue to study 3I/ATLAS, emphasizing the importance of relying on scientific evidence rather than speculation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Current location: Behind the sun</li>
    <li>Initial discovery: July 2025</li>
    <li>Notable features: Coma and tail consistent with a comet</li>
    <li>Composition: Higher carbon dioxide ice content than water ice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS planetary defense system. Since its discovery, it has been observed to have unusual features, leading to speculation about its nature. Presently, the comet is behind the sun and is expected to return to visibility as it continues its trajectory through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If this really is a spaceship, it’s done a bloody good job at camouflaging itself as a comet,” said an astronomer, reinforcing that 3I/ATLAS displays characteristics typical of a comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever observed, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Each of these objects has exhibited peculiar features, but attributing them to extraterrestrial spacecraft is not supported by scientific evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible again, focusing on its trajectory and composition to enhance understanding of interstellar comets.</p>
