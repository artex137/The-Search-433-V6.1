      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS to reach closest point to the Sun today; NASA to monitor peak outgassing activity</h2>

<p>On October 30, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, at a distance of 1.35 astronomical units, or about 125 million miles (202 million kilometres).</p>

<p>This event is significant because it marks a crucial phase for comets with highly eccentric orbits like 3I/ATLAS. As the comet approaches the Sun, rising temperatures will cause the sublimation of surface ice, leading to outgassing and the formation of a bright coma. NASA and other agencies are monitoring the comet's activity, particularly its chemical composition, as it provides insights into its origins and the conditions of the early solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of perihelion: October 30</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: 1.35 astronomical units (125 million miles or 202 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3 at 0.19 AU (17.6 million miles or 28.4 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Estimated brightness at re-emergence: magnitude 12</li>
    <li>Spacecraft monitoring the comet include: NASA's Psyche, Lucy, and the European Space Agency's JUICE</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS entered solar conjunction at the end of September, becoming obscured by the Sun's glare. It is expected to reappear in late November or early December, limiting observation opportunities from Earth-based telescopes.</p>
<p>On October 3, NASA missions on Mars tracked 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach to the Red Planet.</p>
<p>As it reaches perihelion on October 30, scientists will observe increased outgassing activity and the formation of distinct tails due to solar heating.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Preliminary data suggest unusually high concentrations of carbon dioxide and nickel compared to typical solar system comets,” according to NASA scientists.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These differences offer clues about the molecular cloud that gave birth to 3I/ATLAS and its parent star system roughly seven billion years ago,” said a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique as it is not bound to the Sun's orbit, making a one-time pass through the inner solar system. This event provides a rare opportunity for researchers to compare its chemistry with that of our own solar system.</p>
<p>Previous observations of comets have yielded valuable insights, but 3I/ATLAS presents a particularly interesting case due to its interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS re-emerges from behind the Sun at the end of November, scientists will continue to monitor its activity. Advanced observatories such as Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope are expected to capture detailed images of the comet as it remains mildly active.</p>
