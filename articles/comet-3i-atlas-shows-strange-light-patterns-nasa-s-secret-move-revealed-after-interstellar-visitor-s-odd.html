      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS shows strange light patterns: NASA's secret move revealed after interstellar visitor's odd behaviour</h2>

<p>NASA has added Comet 3I/ATLAS to its planetary defense monitoring list following reports of the interstellar object exhibiting unusual behavior. The comet, discovered in July, measures approximately 5.6 kilometres across and weighs about 33 billion tons.</p>

<p>The addition of 3I/ATLAS to the United Nations-endorsed International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) signifies its potential threat to Earth. The comet's hyperbolic orbit, which is characteristic of interstellar objects, has prompted a global simulation exercise aimed at improving asteroid detection and strengthening readiness against cosmic threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object discovered.</li>
    <li>It was first spotted in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet measures approximately 5.6 km in diameter and weighs around 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at nearly twice the speed of previous interstellar visitors.</li>
    <li>It has been added to the Comet Astrometry Campaign for monitoring.</li>
    <li>A training exercise for tracking 3I/ATLAS will occur from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA has not commented on the situation due to a government shutdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023. Following its discovery, the object exhibited strange behaviors, including an anti-tail that points towards the Sun. This prompted the IAWN to acknowledge the unique challenges in predicting its trajectory. Recently, it has been officially added to the monitoring list, leading to a planned global training exercise.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The object has shown several unusual characteristics that set it apart from typical comets,” officials with the International Asteroid Warning Network stated regarding 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, have provided insights into cosmic phenomena. However, 3I/ATLAS's peculiar behavior has raised new questions about the nature of interstellar visitors. The addition of 3I/ATLAS to the monitoring list reflects growing concerns over planetary defense capabilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to refine tracking techniques for 3I/ATLAS during the upcoming training exercise from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026. Further investigations into the comet’s characteristics are expected as scientists continue to monitor its trajectory.</p>
