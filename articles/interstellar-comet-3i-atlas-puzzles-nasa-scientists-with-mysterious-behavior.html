      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS puzzles NASA scientists with mysterious behavior</h2>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has reported unusual behavior from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through our solar system. Discovered in July 2023, the comet has brightened significantly, raising concerns among scientists about its nature and origins.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it creates questions about the comet's composition and trajectory. NASA has utilized its Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to analyze archival images of the comet, revealing that it has become five times brighter between May and July. Experts are closely monitoring the comet as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2023.</li>
  <li>Brightened five times from May to July 2023.</li>
  <li>Distance travelled accounts for only a 1.5 times brightness increase.</li>
  <li>NASA used TESS to analyze images from May 7, 2023.</li>
  <li>Professor Avi Loeb from Harvard has suggested it could be an alien spacecraft.</li>
  <li>Professor Michael Garrett from the University of Manchester stated, “Brightening cannot be explained by geometry alone.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2023, archival images of 3I/ATLAS were captured using NASA's TESS. The comet was officially discovered in July 2023, with its brightness increasing significantly noted in subsequent observations. Experts have since discussed the implications of this unusual behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Brightening cannot be explained by geometry alone,” said Professor Michael Garrett of the University of Manchester. “If the interstellar object isn’t symmetrical, then it rotates and we see different parts of the surface.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Professor Avi Loeb from Harvard has called for governments to take defensive measures, stating that the peculiar behavior of the comet could indicate it is an alien spacecraft.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery adds to a growing list of interstellar objects that have sparked interest and speculation since the first known interstellar object, ‘Oumuamua, was identified in 2017. The behavior of 3I/ATLAS raises further questions about the nature of such objects and their potential implications for Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other scientific agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further studies are expected to focus on understanding the comet's properties and behavior to enhance future disaster preparedness.</p>
