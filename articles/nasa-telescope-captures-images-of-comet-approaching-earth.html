      <h2>NASA telescope captures images of comet approaching Earth</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has photographed comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth, 286 million kilometers away, on November 30, 2023. NASA reported that the comet does not pose any threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the observation of only the third interstellar object ever detected. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics, as it may provide insights into the early formation of the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was photographed 286 million kilometers from Earth on November 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach a maximum distance of 270 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas was first detected on July 1, 2023, using the Atlas telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>It is estimated to be 3 billion years older than the Solar System.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Juice space probe recorded the comet's approach on November 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>Juice's closest approach to 3I/Atlas occurred on November 4, 2023, at approximately 66 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Complete data from the Juice probe will be received on February 18 and 20, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the comet 3I/Atlas was first detected by the Atlas telescope in Chile. Subsequently, ESA's Juice space probe observed the comet on November 2, 2023. Hubble photographed the comet on November 30, 2023, as it moved across the sky. The closest approach of Juice to 3I/Atlas occurred on November 4, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Hubble tracked the comet as it moved across the sky. As a result, background stars appear as trails of light,” NASA said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The instruments collected information about the comet’s behavior and its composition,” ESA stated regarding the Juice observations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The comet’s ‘plasma tail’ – made up of electrically charged gas – extends towards the top of the image. We can also see a fainter ‘dust tail’ – made up of tiny solid particles – that extends towards the bottom left of the image,” ESA explained.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is notable as it is only the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The detection of interstellar objects provides valuable information about the formation of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as its approach to Earth progresses. Scientists expect to analyze the complete data from the Juice probe in 2026, which will offer further insights into the comet's characteristics.</p>
