      <h2>Interstellar object completes visit to the solar system and begins journey without return to deep space</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has completed its passage through the solar system and is now moving away from Earth, having reached its closest approach on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 268 million kilometers from our planet. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks only the third time an interstellar object has been officially catalogued, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The global scientific community is now focusing on analyzing the unique properties of 3I/ATLAS and its implications for our understanding of celestial bodies from outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 268 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed: Exceeding 58 km/s relative to the Sun</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter: Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Next significant encounter: Jupiter on March 16, 2026, at approximately 53 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS warning system in Chile on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, the object garnered attention due to its hyperbolic orbit and high velocity, confirming its status as an interstellar visitor. It reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, before making its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>
<p>After its closest approach, 3I/ATLAS will continue on a trajectory that takes it out of the solar system, with a predicted encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026. Observations have indicated the object will gradually lose brightness as it moves further away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The classification of 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar object reinforces the rarity of such phenomena and provides a unique opportunity for further studies,” said an astronomer involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event marks only the third documented instance of an interstellar object passing through the solar system. The previous objects, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also provided insights into the composition and behavior of celestial bodies originating from other stellar systems. The study of 3I/ATLAS may enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey into deep space, astronomers plan to observe the object during its final visibility periods in the coming weeks. The data collected will contribute to ongoing research into the characteristics of interstellar comets.</p>
