      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mysterious Video Surfaces Online</h2>
<p>A video claiming to show the 3I/ATLAS interstellar comet has gained attention online, with some social media users suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft. The video has circulated widely, sparking debate among astronomy enthusiasts, but scientists have stated that the comet's behavior has natural explanations.</p>

<p>The viral post has reignited interest in 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through the solar system. Researchers have confirmed that the comet is a natural interstellar object, not an artificial one. This clarification comes as astronomers detected radio signals from 3I/ATLAS, which some initially interpreted as evidence of alien activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet was first observed in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It travels at approximately 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at about 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet will remain visible from Earth for several weeks.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey team in Chile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed by the ATLAS survey team on July 1, 2025. Subsequent observations confirmed its trajectory and characteristics. On October 29, 2025, astronomers detected radio signals from the comet around its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion. Following this, the comet brightened and displayed color changes, leading to further speculation about its nature.</p>
<p>Reports of potential alien technology arose after the detection of radio emissions, but scientists quickly clarified that these signals were due to natural processes involving water molecules breaking down as the comet neared the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All the images show a healthy-looking comet,” said Qicheng Zhang from Lowell Observatory, addressing rumors of the comet breaking apart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA scientists explained that the comet's acceleration is likely due to gas emissions rather than propulsion.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows two previous interstellar visitors, ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. While some scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have speculated about its possible artificial origins, the consensus among experts is that it is a natural comet. This aligns with the understanding of similar interstellar objects observed in the past.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it moves toward Jupiter in March 2026. The comet will be monitored for any changes in its behavior or trajectory.</p>
