      <h2>New Data From Keck Telescope Reveals Mysterious Metal Outgassing From Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS As Scientists Race To Study Visitor From Another Star System</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured detailed maps of metal gases escaping from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through our solar system. The observations were made using the Keck II telescope in Hawaii on August 24, 2025, as the object approached its closest point to the Sun.</p>

<p>This research is significant because it provides insights into the chemical composition of materials found around distant stars. Scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is releasing both cyanide gas and nickel vapor, with the nickel remaining closer to the object’s icy core than the cyanide. The findings highlight the fragile nature of the molecules involved, which break apart quickly in sunlight.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation Date: August 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Telescope: Keck II in Hawaii</li>
    <li>Distance from Sun during observation: 257 million miles (approximately 2.75 times Earth's distance)</li>
    <li>Published Study Date: October 15, 2025</li>
    <li>Lead Researcher: W.B. Hoogendam, University of Hawaii</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 24, 2025, researchers utilized the Keck II telescope for 15 minutes to collect light from 3I/ATLAS. This observation occurred as the object moved through space, heading towards its closest approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>The results of this study were published on October 15, 2025, revealing the first detailed maps of the gases emitted by 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What makes this observation special is the telescope’s ability to act like thousands of cameras at once, capturing not just what chemicals are present but exactly where they’re located around the object,” said W.B. Hoogendam.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object detected in our solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of such objects aids scientists in understanding the materials and conditions surrounding alien star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its perihelion, offering a final opportunity to study this cosmic visitor before it exits the solar system.</p>
