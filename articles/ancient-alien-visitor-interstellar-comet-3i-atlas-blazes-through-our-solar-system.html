      <h2>Ancient Alien Visitor? Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Blazes Through Our Solar System</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, has been observed hurtling through our Solar System after its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. The comet has reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, around October 29–30, 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.36 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, which is just inside Mars's orbit.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it offers a unique opportunity to study material from outside our Solar System. Scientists have mobilized telescopes worldwide, including Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope, to observe and analyze 3I/ATLAS. The comet's unusual characteristics have sparked interest among astronomers about its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 58 km/s (~130,000 mph)</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29–30, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: ~1.8 AU (270 million km) in December 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated size: Core up to ~5 km across</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 7–10 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers at the ATLAS telescope identified a fast-moving object that was not bound to the Sun, confirming it as an interstellar comet. Following this, observatories worldwide tracked its trajectory and confirmed its hyperbolic orbit.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion around October 29–30, 2025, positioned behind the Sun, making it difficult to observe from Earth. Despite this, telescopes have captured images and data as the comet continues its journey through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is only the third such interstellar comet we’ve ever been able to study, and planetary scientists are super excited to learn about what comets in other solar systems are like,” said Jason Wright, an astronomer at Penn State.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet,” noted an ESA scientist, emphasizing that no unusual signals or maneuvers have been detected.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of two previous interstellar visitors: 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. While 1I/ʻOumuamua exhibited unusual characteristics, 2I/Borisov behaved like typical comets from our Solar System. 3I/ATLAS appears more akin to Borisov, actively venting gas and dust.</p>

<p>This comet's size and estimated age make it particularly noteworthy, as it is believed to be older than our Solar System, providing insights into the early formation of galaxies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its path away from the Sun, telescopes will remain focused on capturing further observations. ESA’s JUICE probe and NASA’s Europa Clipper may sample the comet’s tail as it drifts outward, providing more data on this ancient interstellar object.</p>
