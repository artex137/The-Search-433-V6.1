      <h2>Ex-NASA Staffer Claims Astronaut Saw Alien Corpses in UFO Crash Footage</h2>

<p>A former NASA staffer has claimed that one of the astronauts who died in the Challenger space shuttle disaster saw footage of alien corpses from a UFO crash. The assertion comes from Clark McClelland, who worked as an operator in the Space Shuttle program and recounted a story from his late colleague, Ellison S. Onizuka. The Challenger tragedy occurred on January 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after launch, resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members.</p>

<p>This claim has resurfaced decades after the Challenger disaster, prompting renewed interest in the events surrounding the 1947 Roswell incident, when the U.S. military initially reported finding a UFO before retracting the statement. Authorities have not responded to the claims made by McClelland, and there is no official investigation into the assertions regarding Onizuka's experience.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident: Challenger space shuttle disaster</li>
    <li>Date: January 28, 1986</li>
    <li>Location: Atlantic Ocean</li>
    <li>Crew members killed: 7</li>
    <li>Former NASA staffer: Clark McClelland</li>
    <li>Colleague: Ellison S. Onizuka</li>
    <li>Notable event: 1947 Roswell UFO incident</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 28, 1986, the Challenger space shuttle launched carrying seven crew members. Just 73 seconds into the flight, an O-ring failure caused the shuttle to explode over the Atlantic Ocean. All crew members were killed in the disaster.</p>

<p>Years later, Clark McClelland recounted a conversation with Ellison S. Onizuka, who reportedly shared an experience involving a film showing alien corpses during military training. McClelland noted that Onizuka had expressed curiosity about extraterrestrial life prior to recounting his experience.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He and this group were at this base for specialized training when they were directed to report to a viewing room,” McClelland recalled Onizuka's story.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The small, strange-looking creatures were humanoid in shape and appeared similar to those described by alleged witnesses at the well-known Roswell site,” he explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Challenger disaster remains one of the most tragic events in NASA's history, highlighting the risks associated with space exploration. The Roswell incident has long been a focal point of UFO conspiracy theories, with claims of government cover-ups and alien encounters persisting for decades.</p>

<p>McClelland's claims about Onizuka's experience add to the ongoing discourse about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and government secrecy surrounding such matters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no known investigations or official responses regarding McClelland's claims. The discussion surrounding the events of Roswell and the Challenger disaster may continue as public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life grows.</p>
