      <h2>Three 'orb' UFOs flying in formation caught in shocking US military footage</h2>

<p>Bizarre footage showing three strange lights flying in formation over the Persian Gulf has been released by the US Department of War. The video, originally taken on August 23, 2012, by an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US Air Force, captures the lights moving shortly after 6 p.m. local time. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The release of this footage raises questions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and has drawn attention from authorities and the public alike. The video has been analyzed on the WEAPONIZED podcast, where hosts Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp discussed its implications and credibility. The footage has been designated as UAP by the US government, indicating it is not classified as a conventional UFO.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The footage was recorded by a US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone on August 23, 2012, at approximately 6 p.m. local time. It has only recently been made public by the US Department of War. The video shows three lights maintaining a consistent formation, forming a triangle shape, except for one instance when one light dropped back slightly.</p>

<p>The footage was analyzed on the WEAPONIZED podcast, where Corbell and Knapp discussed its features and the significance of its military origins. They debated the reliability of the footage, highlighting its designation as UAP by the US government.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These objects appear to be aware and intelligent of one another, and they're keeping equidistant as they fly,” said Jeremy Corbell, discussing the movements of the lights.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is a military recorded sensor-generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO... and clearly, you watch this, and that's not what it is,” stated George Knapp.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Your government has labeled this UAP, and you were never supposed to see this footage,” Corbell claimed.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent release of this footage adds to ongoing discussions surrounding UFO sightings and UAP. Previous incidents have often sparked public interest and debate over the existence of extraterrestrial life. The classification of such phenomena as UAP by government agencies indicates a shift in how these sightings are approached and investigated.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any ongoing investigations related to this specific footage. However, the US government's designation of the footage as UAP suggests that further analysis may be conducted as part of broader efforts to understand unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
