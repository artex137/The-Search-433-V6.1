      <h2>American Documentary, UFO and Bird Street Street Bring Second ‘Shorts In-Session’ to CIFF, Spotlighting Works-in-Progress</h2>

<p>American Documentary, Untitled Filmmaker Org (UFO), and Bird Street Productions have announced the selected projects for the second edition of Shorts In-Session, a work-in-progress program taking place at the Camden International Film Festival (CIFF) on September 12, 2025. The initiative aims to support short-form documentary makers as they refine their films.</p>

<p>This program matters because it addresses the challenges faced by documentary filmmakers during the editing process, which can often feel isolating. By providing a platform for filmmakers to present excerpts of their work and engage in discussions with industry experts, the organizers hope to foster collaboration and enhance the quality of the films being produced.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: September 12, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Camden International Film Festival (CIFF)</li>
    <li>Organizers: American Documentary, Untitled Filmmaker Org (UFO), Bird Street Productions</li>
    <li>Working committee includes Sean Weiner, Arno Mokros, Martha Gregory, and Opal H. Bennett</li>
    <li>Focus: Support for short-form documentary filmmakers in production or post-production</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Shorts In-Session has been conceived as a community-driven forum for filmmakers. Participants are invited to screen excerpts of their projects and discuss editorial choices with an expert panel.

</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>

Organizations like UFO and Bird Street Productions prioritize inclusivity and support for underrepresented voices in the industry. Such initiatives are essential for fostering creativity and innovation in documentary filmmaking.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the Shorts In-Session event, participants will continue to develop their films with insights gained from the expert panel and audience feedback. The aim is to enhance their projects for future screenings and distribution opportunities.</p>
