      <h2>Afterthoughts on the Non-Gravitational Acceleration of 3I/ATLAS at Perihelion</h2>

<p>A report released on the non-gravitational acceleration of comet 3I/ATLAS has revealed that the comet was 4 arcseconds displaced from its expected trajectory based on gravity alone during perihelion on October 29, 2025. The data was obtained from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS may have lost a substantial portion of its mass due to cometary outgassing, which could explain its unexpected acceleration. Researchers, including Avi Loeb, have initiated calculations to assess the implications of this acceleration, as well as the potential for further observations in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was 4 arcseconds off its predicted position on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The non-gravitational acceleration measured was approximately 0.02 millimeters per second squared.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to lose at least one-sixth of its mass by December 2025.</li>
    <li>The mass loss rate is estimated at 150 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass closest to Earth at a distance of 269 million kilometers on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Between November 27, 2025, and January 27, 2026, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) will monitor 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, data from ALMA indicated that 3I/ATLAS was significantly off its expected trajectory, prompting further investigation into its acceleration. Following this, calculations were made to determine the mass loss required to account for the observed acceleration. The findings suggest that the comet has been losing mass rapidly.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth, providing an opportunity for extensive observation by ground-based and space telescopes. The IAWN will begin monitoring the comet shortly before this date.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The non-gravitational force acting on 3I/ATLAS equals its mass times its non-gravitational acceleration,” said Avi Loeb, discussing the implications of the findings.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Scientific truth is not decided by a popularity contest but by attention to data — especially when it is anomalous,” Loeb added, addressing claims made by others regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS echo those made during the encounter with the first interstellar object, 1I/`Oumuamua, which also exhibited non-gravitational acceleration without visible signs of gas or dust. This raises questions about the classification of such objects and their potential origins.</p>
<p>Prior to this, Loeb has published numerous scientific papers discussing the anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, emphasizing the need for rigorous examination of the data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As observations continue, researchers will monitor 3I/ATLAS closely to determine if a massive gas cloud is present around it. The results of the IAWN monitoring campaign will be crucial in understanding the comet's behavior and the nature of its acceleration.</p>
