      <h2>3I/ATLAS Today (Nov. 13, 2025): Interstellar comet’s tail keeps growing, ‘radio signal’ confirmed natural, and a different ATLAS comet fragments</h2>

<p>Fresh observations on November 13, 2025, have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object, remains a natural comet, while a different ATLAS-discovered comet, C/2025 K1 (ATLAS), is visibly fragmenting. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it helps clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS and distinguishes it from other celestial bodies. Authorities, including NASA and various astronomers, continue to monitor both comets closely, providing updates on their trajectories and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet 3I/ATLAS</strong> is currently on a hyperbolic trajectory through the inner solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is located approximately <strong>1.8 AU</strong> from Earth, posing no threat.</li>
    <li>Images captured on Nov. 10-11 show the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS stretching roughly <strong>0.7 degrees</strong>.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA have launched a wide campaign of observations, utilizing assets like Hubble and Webb.</li>
    <li><strong>C/2025 K1 (ATLAS)</strong> is showing clear signs of fragmentation, with multiple sub-components visible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, coming within approximately 1.4 AU of the Sun. Observations have shown that as it warmed, it began venting water, leading to increased outgassing.</p>
<p>On November 11, astronomers captured images of 3I/ATLAS which led to discussions about its integrity and potential unusual features. Following this, on November 13, new imagery confirmed the comet's tail has grown and a natural radio signal was detected.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) exhibited significant fragmentation, with new images showing multiple pieces in its inner coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The radio detection confirms that the hydroxyl absorption is a result of natural processes, not technology,” NASA stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard’s Avi Loeb commented, “Images suggest 3I/ATLAS remains a single body, but we need more observations to understand its peculiar features.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar visitor studied by scientists, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS displays classic cometary features, providing a unique opportunity for comparison with Solar System comets.</p>
<p>C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has been under observation since its discovery, with its recent fragmentation highlighting the volatile nature of comets from the Oort Cloud.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor both comets through ground- and space-based assets. Coordinated observations are planned throughout November 2025, with 3I/ATLAS expected to pass beyond Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
