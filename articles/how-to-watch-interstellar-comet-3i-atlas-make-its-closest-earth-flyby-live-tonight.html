      <h2>How To Watch Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Make Its Closest Earth Flyby Live Tonight</h2>

<p>In just a few hours, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth, reaching a distance of about 168 million miles (270 million kilometres) on Friday, 19th December. This comet, which is the third interstellar object ever detected in our solar system, is travelling at a speed of 144,100 mph. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This flyby is significant for both scientists and stargazers, as it presents a rare opportunity to observe an object from beyond our solar system. The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a livestream of the event, allowing viewers to witness the comet's passage before it disappears into the depths of space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is making its closest approach to Earth on 19th December.</li>
    <li>The comet will be approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometres) away at its closest point.</li>
    <li>It is travelling at a speed of 144,100 mph.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project will host a livestream starting at 11 p.m. EST on 18th December (0400 GMT on 19th December).</li>
    <li>The comet reached its perihelion on 30th October.</li>
    <li>Its next significant encounter is with Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been on a unique journey, having been detected as the third interstellar object in our solar system. The comet reached its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, on 30th October. It is currently en route to its closest approach to Earth on 19th December, after which it will continue on to Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<p>NASA has been monitoring the comet closely, debunking speculation about its nature during a briefing in November. It confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, despite earlier comparisons to other interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We very much want to find signs of life in our universe, but 3I/ATLAS is a comet.” 
    <strong>- Amit Kshatriya, NASA Associate Administrator</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the first interstellar object to display a 'wobbling jet', a phenomenon detected by astronomers using the Two-meter Twin Telescope at Tenerife's Teide Observatory. This marks a significant achievement in studying interstellar visitors. Observations have also revealed an extensive X-ray glow around the comet, furthering our understanding of its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its flyby of Earth, 3I/ATLAS will head towards Jupiter in March 2026, continuing its journey through the solar system before exiting the heliosphere and returning to interstellar space.</p>
