      <h2>3I/ATLAS is Still a Single Body with a Sunward Anti-Tail After Perihelion</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has remained intact following its perihelion passage, according to images captured on November 11, 2025. Observations made by David Jewitt and Jane Luu at the Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma, Canary Islands, show a single body with no signs of breakup.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it contradicts expectations for natural comets, which typically fragment under similar conditions. The findings have prompted further analysis and discussion among astronomers regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its anomalies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 11, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of telescope: La Palma, Canary Islands</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: 1.43 astronomical units (au)</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 2.16 au</li>
    <li>Size of imaged region: approximately half a million kilometers wide</li>
    <li>Previous imaging date: July 21, 2025 (Hubble Space Telescope)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of 3I/ATLAS showing an anti-tail directed towards the Sun. Following this, the object reached its perihelion, where it was expected to exhibit typical cometary behavior, including possible fragmentation.</p>
<p>On November 9, 2025, wide-field images indicated the presence of long-range jet structures extending towards the Sun and away from it. However, subsequent observations on November 11 revealed 3I/ATLAS as a single intact body, raising questions about its unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The fact that 3I/ATLAS remains a single body is surprising for a natural comet,” said Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Knowledge is realizing that the street is one way; wisdom is looking in both directions anyway,” Loeb added, referencing the need for open-minded inquiry into the nature of 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous observations of comets have shown that they often break apart when subjected to the intense heat and gravitational forces near the Sun. The integrity of 3I/ATLAS challenges traditional understandings of comet behavior and has sparked debate within the scientific community about its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS are expected as astronomers seek to explain its unique properties and the implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
