      <h2>Obama clarifies alien comments after podcast remarks</h2>

<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama has clarified his comments regarding the existence of aliens after stating on a podcast that "they're real." Obama made the remarks during an episode of "The Brian Tyler Cohen Show" over the weekend, which has since generated significant public interest.</p>

<p>Obama's clarification is important as it addresses public curiosity about extraterrestrial life and the government's stance on UFOs. Following his initial statement, he emphasized that while the universe is vast, he has seen no evidence of contact with aliens during his presidency.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Podcast: "The Brian Tyler Cohen Show"</li>
    <li>Date of podcast: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Obama's statement: "They're real," but no evidence of contact</li>
    <li>Area 51: A top-secret site acknowledged by the CIA in 2013</li>
    <li>Size of Area 51: 8,000 square miles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During a lightning round of questions on the podcast, Obama was asked if aliens are real. He responded affirmatively but added that he had not seen them and that they are not being kept at Area 51. Following the podcast, he released a statement on Instagram to clarify his position, noting the vastness of the universe and the low probability of contact with extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>In his Instagram statement, Obama reiterated that while statistically there may be life elsewhere in the universe, the chances of having been visited by aliens are low. He confirmed that he saw no evidence of extraterrestrial contact during his time in office.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention, let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The secrecy surrounding Area 51 has long fueled conspiracy theories among UFO enthusiasts. The CIA acknowledged the existence of the site in 2013, but it did not confirm any claims regarding UFO crashes or extraterrestrial beings. Declassified documents have referred to the facility, which has served as a testing ground for advanced aircraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no ongoing investigations related to Obama's comments or UFO sightings. The public's interest in UFOs and government transparency regarding extraterrestrial life continues to grow.</p>
