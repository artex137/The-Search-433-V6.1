      <h2>Scientists issue chilling update on mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Scientists have provided a significant update on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently travelling through our solar system. The object was first detected by a NASA telescope on July 1, 2025, as it approached the sun at a speed of 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 km/h). A study has revealed that 3I/ATLAS could have been spotted up to two months earlier, with new images dating back to May 7.</p>

<p>This discovery is important because it allows scientists to refine their predictions about the comet's orbit and behaviour. Authorities are now analyzing the early data to understand the unusual brightness of the comet, which has increased significantly as it nears the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS asteroid warning system.</li>
    <li>Early observations date back to May 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>Initial brightness increase observed was five times greater than expected.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Brightness increase observed when the comet was six times further from the sun than Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by NASA's ATLAS system on July 1, 2025. Ten days prior, it had been observed by the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile. Following this, astronomers conducted a search of historical data and found that the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) had captured images of the comet as early as May 7, 2025. Researchers used a technique called 'shift-stacking' to enhance the visibility of the comet in these images.</p>

<p>This early detection has allowed scientists to better estimate the comet's orbit and understand its rapid brightness changes, which are unusual for a typical comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Whenever astronomers find something that varies with time, we try to find earlier observations so that we can track how it has changed over a longer time period,” said Dr. Mark Norris, an observational astronomer from the University of Lancashire.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The observed brightening cannot be explained by geometry alone,” stated Professor Michael Garrett, an astronomer from the University of Manchester.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of precovery allows astronomers to find earlier images of celestial objects that may have been missed during their initial discovery. This process is crucial for refining predictions about the orbits of these objects, particularly those that may only be visible for a limited time.</p>

<p>Some scientists have speculated that the unusual brightness of 3I/ATLAS could suggest non-natural origins. However, most experts attribute the increased brightness to the rapid evaporation of volatile ices as the comet approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from TESS and other telescopes to monitor the behaviour of 3I/ATLAS as it travels closer to the sun. Further observations may provide additional insights into the comet's composition and trajectory.</p>
