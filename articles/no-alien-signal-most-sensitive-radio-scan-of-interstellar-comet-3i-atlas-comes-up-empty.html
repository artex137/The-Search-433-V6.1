      <h2>No alien signal: most sensitive radio scan of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS comes up empty</h2>

<p>Researchers with the Breakthrough Listen program have reported no evidence of an artificial radio signal from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS following a deep scan conducted on December 18, 2025, at the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. The comet is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>This finding is significant because 3I/ATLAS is a rare astronomical object that has sparked interest amid a surge of speculation regarding potential extraterrestrial technology. Scientists are using the comet to refine methods for searching and measuring orbits in the ongoing quest for technosignatures—signals that may indicate engineered sources.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Date of radio scan: December 18, 2025</li>
  <li>Location of the telescope: Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, West Virginia</li>
  <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 270 million kilometers)</li>
  <li>Magnitude of comet: +15.6 at the start of 2026</li>
  <li>Current observational campaign end date: January 27, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS passed Earth at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units. Researchers conducted a radio scan using the Green Bank Telescope shortly before this close approach. The scan involved four receiver bands, ranging from 1 to 12 gigahertz, and yielded no evidence of artificial signals.</p>

<p>After rejecting a small set of candidate detections due to radio-frequency interference, the research team concluded that there are no isotropic continuous-wave transmitters above 0.1 watts at the location of 3I/ATLAS. The findings were published in a report by astronomers from the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our survey concludes that there are no isotropic continuous-wave transmitters above 0.1 W at the location of 3I/ATLAS,” said Ben Jacobson-Bell, an astronomer involved in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is a notable interstellar visitor, joining only 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov in this category. Previous observations of these objects prompted extensive data collection across the electromagnetic spectrum, as they quickly faded from view. The recent findings regarding 3I/ATLAS indicate that it behaves like a typical comet rather than a source of artificial signals.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network is conducting an observing campaign until January 27 to improve precise measurements of 3I/ATLAS's position, as its coma and tail make it more challenging to track than a typical asteroid.</p>
