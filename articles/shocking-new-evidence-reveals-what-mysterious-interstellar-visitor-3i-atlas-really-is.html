      <h2>Shocking new evidence reveals what mysterious interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS really is</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has shown surprising characteristics that suggest it may not be a comet, according to recent observations. The object, which passed closest to the Sun on October 29, 2025, has remained intact, a finding that defies typical comet behavior, researchers have reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the true nature of 3I/ATLAS and whether it could be an artificial structure. Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who has been vocal about the object's potential technological origins, stated that the new data supports his theory, prompting further investigation into the interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across</li>
    <li><strong>Material ejection:</strong> Estimated at five billion tons per month</li>
    <li><strong>Anti-tail length:</strong> 620,000 miles (1 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Jet length (facing away from the Sun):</strong> 1.86 million miles (3 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Next closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025. It passed closest to the Sun on October 29, where it was expected to show signs of melting and fragmentation typical of comets. Contrary to these expectations, new images taken on November 9 indicate that the object has not broken apart and is still a single, bright entity.</p>

<p>Researchers, including astronomers David Jewitt and Jane Luu, have noted the presence of a glowing coma around 3I/ATLAS, as well as unusual jets of material being ejected in both directions. These findings raise questions about the object's composition and origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Technological thrusters which point their exhaust towards the sun would accelerate away from the Sun. This post-perihelion maneuver might be employed by a spacecraft that aims to gain speed rather than slow down through the gravitational assist from the sun."</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA administrator Sean Duffy has pushed back on the speculation saying, "Any theories that the object contains alien life or will collide with Earth are not true."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have led to a divide in scientific opinion. While some astronomers argue it is a comet with a unique chemical makeup, others, like Loeb, suggest it may be a craft of extraterrestrial origin. This debate reflects ongoing discussions in the scientific community regarding the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into 3I/ATLAS are ongoing, with calls for NASA to release more images and data collected during its journey. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has expressed her concern over withheld information and has supported further inquiries into the object's anomalies.</p>
