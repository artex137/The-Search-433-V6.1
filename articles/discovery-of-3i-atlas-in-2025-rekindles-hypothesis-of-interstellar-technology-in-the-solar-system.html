      <h2>Discovery of Comet 3I/Atlas Rekindles Interstellar Technology Hypothesis</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, has sparked renewed discussions about interstellar technology in the Solar System. The comet, traveling at a speed of 210,000 km/h, is the third known interstellar object following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the discovery.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/Atlas lies in its unusual characteristics, which have prompted scientists to analyze its composition and trajectory. Authorities, including NASA and international astronomers, are actively monitoring the comet as it approaches Jupiter in December 2025. There are concerns regarding its atypical chemical composition and non-gravitational acceleration, which have led to hypotheses about its origins and potential technological implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas detected on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile.</li>
    <li>Travels at a speed of 210,000 km/h, with peaks exceeding 245,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Third confirmed interstellar object, following Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
    <li>Composition: 95% carbon dioxide, 5% water; atypical for solar system objects.</li>
    <li>Proximity to Jupiter scheduled for December 2025.</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration observed; jets directed towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>International Asteroid Warning Network monitoring until January 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, ATLAS detected 3I/Atlas as a moving point in dense star fields in the constellation Sagittarius. Observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility in California confirmed its interstellar trajectory with pre-discovery data from June 2025. The Minor Planet Center assigned it the designation 3I on July 2, marking its status as an interstellar interloper.</p>

<p>By August 2025, the Very Large Telescope in Chile observed a plume of pure nickel emitted from the comet, with no associated iron. This finding suggested industrial processes, according to preliminary analysis by astronomer Avi Loeb. Further observations in September from NASA's SPHEREx satellite noted an unusual gas composition with low water presence and high CO2 levels.</p>

<p>On October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun, revealing a diffuse appearance and reddish color. In November, ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars captured images showing water vapor 30 million km from Mars, while NASA began an astrometric campaign on October 31 to track the comet's trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The alignment between the perijove of Jupiter and the radius of Hill indicates intentional maneuver,” suggesting advanced propulsion strategies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas follows previous interstellar objects, Oumuamua and Borisov, which exhibited distinct characteristics. Oumuamua showed non-gravitational acceleration without a coma, prompting speculation about solar sailing. Borisov displayed a traditional coma with cyanide, contrasting with the unique features of 3I/Atlas.</p>

<p>Researchers have noted that three interstellar visits in eight years challenge existing models of interstellar ejection, indicating a potentially greater density of objects at the galactic periphery.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network plans to continue monitoring 3I/Atlas until January 2026, focusing on its trajectory near Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Astronomers will search for definitive evidence of cometary activity during its approach on December 19, 2025, when it will be 277 million km from Earth.</p>
