      <h2>Trump pledge to release UFO records excites enthusiasts, but some experts are skeptical</h2>

<p>On Thursday evening, a strange object appeared in the sky over southern British Columbia, leading some residents to wonder if it was a UFO. It was later identified as the exhaust plume from a SpaceX rocket. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he will direct the Pentagon and other government agencies to find and release files related to aliens and UFOs, now referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>This announcement has generated excitement among UFO enthusiasts. Chris Rutkowski, a Winnipeg-based UFO researcher, described it as “Christmas” for those eager to see the documents. However, he expressed skepticism about the lack of specifics and timelines in Trump's statement, calling it a “very soft suggestion.” The renewed focus on UAPs follows recent comments from former President Barack Obama, who stated in a podcast that aliens are real, although he has seen no evidence of extraterrestrial contact during his presidency.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on Thursday evening in southern British Columbia.</li>
    <li>U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to release UFO-related files on Truth Social.</li>
    <li>Chris Rutkowski, a UFO researcher, expressed both excitement and skepticism about the announcement.</li>
    <li>Barack Obama stated, “They’re real,” during a podcast interview, but clarified he meant other life might exist in the universe.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon found no evidence of aliens or extraterrestrial technology in a 2024 report.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday evening, a plume from a SpaceX rocket confused residents in southern British Columbia, leading to speculation about UFOs. Later that day, President Trump posted on Truth Social, stating he would direct the Pentagon to release UFO records.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Obama made headlines with his comments on extraterrestrial life during a podcast interview. He clarified on Instagram that he was referring to the vastness of the universe rather than confirming evidence of aliens.</p>
<p>In recent years, the U.S. government has released more information about UAPs, including congressional hearings on the topic.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“A lot of UFO fans are really excited. This is what they’ve been waiting for.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s sort of a very soft suggestion that he’s going to start the process.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There will be quite a lot more information that has to be released.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Some people have said this was going to be a distraction from some other files he doesn’t want to release.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The conversation around UAPs has intensified in recent years, particularly following the U.S. government's release of information and reports. In 2024, the Pentagon stated it found no evidence of extraterrestrial technology, yet many believe there is more information being withheld. Rutkowski noted that Canada may be more transparent about UAPs than the U.S., citing the information released about balloons shot down over the North in 2023.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Rutkowski hopes Trump’s announcement could lead to more information being released about UAPs, but he cautioned that it remains to be seen whether any significant details will emerge.</p>
