      <h2>3I/ATLAS: If It's Not A Comet, The Universe Just Got Stranger, Says NASA</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, despite growing speculation among scientists that the interstellar object may be unlike anything previously observed. First detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS travels on a hyperbolic orbit at an extraordinary speed, indicating it originated outside the Solar System. Its unusual chemical composition and erratic brightness have prompted debate about its classification among known comets.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as astronomers are eager to decode the mysteries of 3I/ATLAS, which is only the third interstellar object ever recorded. The object’s CO₂-rich coma and peculiar behaviour challenge existing scientific models and offer insights into the formation of protoplanetary discs in distant star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Travels on a hyperbolic orbit, indicating an origin outside the Solar System.</li>
    <li>NASA has classified it as a comet based on its behaviour and appearance.</li>
    <li>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed an unusually CO₂-dominant chemical profile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever recorded, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile first detected 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, astronomers observed its comet-like features, including a glowing coma and a dust-gas tail. The James Webb Space Telescope later provided crucial data, revealing its unique chemical composition.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the end of its visible trajectory, astronomers are racing to complete final observations before it fades beyond the reach of telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nicky Fox, a NASA official, stated, "It looks and behaves like a comet. All evidence points to it being a comet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects had been confirmed: 'Oumuamua, which lacked a visible tail, and Borisov, which displayed more traditional comet characteristics. The distinctive behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has sparked discussions among scientists regarding its classification and implications for our understanding of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to gather and analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. Future studies may further clarify its classification and contribute to our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
