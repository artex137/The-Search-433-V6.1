      <h2>3I/ATLAS is coming to 'check us out': Musk's ex, Grimes, joins debate on 'mysterious stranger'</h2>

<p>Canadian artist Claire Elise Boucher, known as Grimes, has presented a theory about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may be observing humans to determine if they are ready to join an “alien federation of civilisations.” Grimes shared her thoughts on X, formerly Twitter, on November 29, igniting discussions about the comet's significance.</p>

<p>The comet has garnered attention from both the scientific community and the public. Authorities and scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS, which is only the third interstellar object observed in the solar system. These studies could lead to new discoveries about interstellar visitors, particularly with the capabilities of the Vera Rubin Observatory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Notable figure: Claire Elise Boucher (Grimes)</li>
    <li>Date of Grimes's comments: November 29</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li>Scientific observation by: Vera Rubin Observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Grimes shared her theory about 3I/ATLAS on November 29, suggesting the comet could be evaluating humanity. In her post, she indicated that achieving certain goals might allow humanity to join an alien federation. She acknowledged her perspective as a fantasy.</p>

<p>In response to a comment discussing potential methods of alien concealment, Grimes expressed her desire to maintain her imaginative view, stating, "Stop destroying my fantasies with ur realistic and informed takes."</p>

<p>Grimes also noted that regardless of the comet's origins, it represents a captivating narrative for children and adults alike.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“My theory is 3i atlas is coming to check us out cuz we're so close to asi and perhaps when we achieve certain goals we get to join the alien federation of civilizations or else they need to check if we're mentally stable for such god like tech and if they need to eradicate us (in which case we shud be nicer).” - Grimes</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I love when there are scientific discoveries or debates that are as legible and interesting for little humans as they are to adults.” - Grimes</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of two other interstellar objects, Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both identified in the past decade. The attention surrounding these objects highlights a growing interest in the study of interstellar phenomena and their implications for understanding our universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS and gather data as it exits the solar system, potentially revealing more about its nature and origins. Observations at the Vera Rubin Observatory are expected to uncover more interstellar objects in the future.</p>
