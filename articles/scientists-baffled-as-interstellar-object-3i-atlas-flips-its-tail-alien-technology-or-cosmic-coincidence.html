      <h2>Scientists Baffled as Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Flips Its Tail</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed a significant change in the behaviour of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has flipped its jet from a sunward 'anti-tail' to a classic tail streaming away from the Sun. This event was confirmed by new images from the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands, taken sometime between July and September 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This change has reignited debates among scientists regarding the true nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities are closely monitoring the object as it approaches its closest point to the Sun (perihelion) on 29 October 2025. The implications of this reversal could challenge current cometary theories and prompt further investigation into whether it is a natural phenomenon or a technologically controlled entity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation period: July to September 2025</li>
    <li>Confirmed by: Nordic Optical Telescope, Canary Islands</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: 29 October 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025</li>
    <li>Size: 5 kilometres</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: 33 billion tonnes</li>
    <li>Material lost so far: 2 million tonnes (0.00005% of total mass)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation since its initial detection. Between July and September 2025, scientists captured images showing a dramatic change in its behaviour.</p>
<p>On 29 October 2025, the object is expected to reach perihelion, where it will be subjected to significant solar radiation.</p>
<p>Following its closest approach to the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will come closest to Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a leading scientist in the field, has noted, "If 3I/ATLAS remains stable under this intense heat, the comet theory will become much harder to defend."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb has also stated, "If the object glows naturally from heat on its post-solar side, I will downgrade its anomalous nature."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has sparked discussions regarding the nature of interstellar objects. This is not the first time scientists have encountered oddities in celestial bodies, but the current debate between natural phenomena and potential extraterrestrial technology represents a significant divergence in scientific thought.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely as it approaches perihelion. The behaviours observed post-29 October will be crucial in determining the object's classification and the validity of existing theories regarding its nature.</p>
