      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Observed in Morning Sky</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has returned to view in the morning sky after weeks of being hidden behind the Sun. First spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, this rare comet is the third known interstellar object and has generated significant interest among astronomers and the public alike. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to its observation.</p>

<p>The comet's return is significant as it offers scientists a unique opportunity to study the chemistry of interstellar objects. Observations from various telescopes have confirmed its classification as a natural comet, despite some debate over its unusual characteristics. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Current Visibility:</strong> Morning sky</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmed Interstellar Objects:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is the third, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Primary Observatories Involved:</strong> Hubble, SPHEREx, ESA Mars orbiters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has undergone several notable events:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>July 1, 2025:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope.</li>
    <li><strong>October 29, 2025:</strong> The comet reaches perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li><strong>November 2, 2025:</strong> The comet becomes visible again after being obscured by the Sun.</li>
    <li><strong>November 4, 2025:</strong> Scientists report a puzzling color change in the comet.</li>
    <li><strong>November 10, 2025:</strong> The comet is observed emitting a radio signal and developing prominent tails.</li>
    <li><strong>November 11, 2025:</strong> Questions arise about whether the comet has fragmented due to its solar encounter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it wasn’t decimated by the Sun and still holds together as a single body, then we’ll have to consider the possibility it’s something other than a natural comet,” said Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a rare group of interstellar comets, with only two others previously confirmed. Its unusual properties have sparked discussions among scientists, particularly regarding its brightness and trajectory. While some, like Avi Loeb, speculate about exotic explanations, the majority of the scientific community supports the idea that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations are planned as 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on December 19, 2025. Astronomers will utilize ground-based observatories and space telescopes to determine whether the comet has survived its close solar encounter and to gain insights into its composition and behavior.</p>
