      <h2>China probe documents passage of interstellar visitor through the orbit of the Red Planet</h2>

<p>The Administração Espacial Nacional of China has successfully recorded the passage of comet 3I/ATLAS as it crossed the vicinity of Mars, using the Tianwen-1 orbiter. The operation took place at an approximate distance of 30 million kilometers from the comet, marking a significant achievement in the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>This encounter is noteworthy as it represents only the third time in history that an object from outside the solar system has been closely observed. The data collected has excited the international scientific community, as the perspective from Martian orbit offers unique insights that are unattainable from Earth. The mission demonstrates the advanced capabilities of China's deep tracking systems and enhances global collaboration in space exploration.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: Approximately 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed of comet: 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Diameter of comet: Approximately 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet's tail length: 56,000 kilometers</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: Administração Espacial Nacional (China), Agência Espacial Europeia (ESA), NASA, Emirados Árabes Unidos</li>
    <li>Date of comet identification: July 2025</li>
    <li>Mission duration: Tianwen-1 arrived at Mars in February 2021</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The identification of comet 3I/ATLAS occurred in July 2025 when the ATLAS warning system in Chile detected its hyperbolic orbit. The Tianwen-1 orbiter performed complex maneuvers to capture images of the comet as it approached Mars. Engineers conducted extensive simulations to optimize exposure times for the high-resolution HiRIC camera, resulting in a series of 30-second sequences that revealed the comet's structure.</p>

<p>Preliminary analyses of the images and spectral data indicate that the comet has an active rocky core surrounded by gas and dust. The passage of 3I/ATLAS mobilized a global observation network, with ESA and NASA utilizing their respective probes to gather complementary data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The success of capturing images validates the capabilities of deep tracking systems developed by Chinese aerospace engineering,” said a spokesperson from the Administração Espacial Nacional.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The observation perspective from Martian orbit offers illumination angles and geometric data impossible to obtain from Earth,” remarked an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event follows the previous close encounters of interstellar objects, Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such objects provides crucial insights into the formation of our solar system and the materials present in distant protoplanetary disks. The international collaboration in observing 3I/ATLAS illustrates a growing trend towards cooperative space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Tianwen-1 probe continues to operate as an advanced astronomical observatory. Future missions, including Tianwen-2, aim to collect asteroid samples and further study main-belt comets, enhancing humanity's understanding of the solar system.</p>
