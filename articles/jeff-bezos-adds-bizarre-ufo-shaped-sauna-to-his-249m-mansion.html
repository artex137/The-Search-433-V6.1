      <h2>Jeff Bezos adds UFO-shaped sauna to Beverly Hills mansion</h2>

<p>Jeff Bezos and his wife Lauren Sanchez have installed a UFO-shaped sauna at their Beverly Hills mansion, valued at $US165 million ($A249 million). The unique structure, resembling a NASA rocket command module, sits in the backyard of the estate, which has been under renovation since Bezos purchased it in 2020.</p>

<p>The addition of the sauna is noteworthy as it reflects Bezos's interest in space exploration, particularly through his venture, Blue Origin. While neither Bezos nor Sanchez have commented publicly on the sauna, the installation aligns with the billionaire's high-profile space projects.</p>
