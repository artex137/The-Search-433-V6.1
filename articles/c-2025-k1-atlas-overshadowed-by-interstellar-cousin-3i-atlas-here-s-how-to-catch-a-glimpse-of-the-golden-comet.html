      <h2>C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) Overshadowed By Interstellar Cousin 3I/ATLAS; Here’s How To Catch A Glimpse Of The Golden Comet</h2>

<p>C/2025 K1 (ATLAS), a comet first discovered on May 24, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System, reached its perihelion on October 8, 2025, and will be closest to Earth on November 25, 2025, at a distance of 60,332,480 kilometers, or 0.40 AU. The comet has transformed in appearance, becoming brighter and shifting from green to a golden hue.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is one of the dimmest in a trio of green comets. Its color change is attributed to the lack of common molecules found in many comets, such as dicarbon, carbon monoxide, and cyanide. Despite its striking presence, it has been overshadowed by its interstellar counterpart, 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> May 24, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 8, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> November 25, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Distance:</strong> 60,332,480 kilometers (0.40 AU)</li>
    <li><strong>Color Change:</strong> From green to golden</li>
    <li><strong>Location for Viewing:</strong> Near Ursa Major, eastern sky before sunrise</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was first discovered on May 24, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System. The comet reached its perihelion on October 8, 2025, and is set to be closest to Earth on November 25, 2025.</p>

<p>Initially expected to be obliterated during its perihelion, C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has instead emerged in a brighter form, noted for its golden hue.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The color of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is attributed to the scarcity of molecules like dicarbon, carbon monoxide, and cyanide, a common composition amongst conventional comets,” according to the JPL Small-Body Database.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is part of a group of comets, including C/2025 A6 Lemmon and C/2025 R2 Swan. These comets have been observed for their unusual characteristics, particularly their color changes and brightness.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has drawn substantial attention, overshadowing other comets in the same observation window.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers can expect to view C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) in the coming weeks, particularly near Ursa Major and the eastern sky before sunrise. Its live position can be tracked as it approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>
