      <h2>Abnormal radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS put NASA on high alert</h2>

<p>The international scientific community has detected anomalous radio signals from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, prompting NASA's Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária (PDCO) to mobilize and coordinate a global observation campaign. The signals, captured on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa, have raised significant interest due to their complex and repetitive structure, which does not align with known natural patterns.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it poses a unique scientific opportunity to understand more about celestial bodies and their behavior. The unusual signals have triggered cooperation among various space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), to analyze the emissions and determine their nature and origin. Although comet 3I/ATLAS poses no collision risk to Earth, the emissions present a mystery that could challenge current astrophysical assumptions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Signals recorded at a frequency of 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Initial observations indicate a nucleus a few kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>NASA's PDCO has activated high-priority protocols for observation.</li>
    <li>Collaboration includes ESA and other international partners.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS astronomical survey system. Following its detection, scientists calculated its trajectory, confirming it would safely pass through our solar system. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope captured anomalous radio signals from the comet. This detection led to the activation of NASA's PDCO protocols and the coordination of a global observation campaign.</p>

<p>As part of this effort, multiple ground-based and space-based telescopes, including the Very Large Telescope (VLT), Hubble, and James Webb, have been tasked with monitoring the comet continuously.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of these signals is unprecedented and could represent a new astrophysical phenomenon,” said a spokesperson from NASA's PDCO.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are working collaboratively with global partners to gather as much data as possible to understand this object,” stated a representative from ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to cross our solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirms it originated from another star system. The detection of radio signals is particularly significant, as it could lead to new discoveries about the nature of interstellar comets and their interactions with solar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are currently conducting detailed spectral analysis of the signals to explore their origin, considering possibilities from unknown natural phenomena to potential technosignatures. Continuous monitoring will refine calculations regarding the comet's trajectory and ensure it remains a safe distance from Earth.</p>
