      <h2>'NASA is currently closed' - Space agency shuts down its website indefinitely</h2>

<p>NASA has ceased updates to its website as of Friday morning, October 3, 2023, due to a lack of federal funding. The shutdown comes just before the anticipated flyby of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which was expected to yield notable images from the agency’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

<p>This closure is significant as it hinders public access to information and updates from NASA during a critical time for space exploration. The agency's website displays a message stating, "Due to the lapse in federal government funding, NASA is not updating this website." This decision has sparked outrage among scientists and astronomers, who fear that budget cuts will delay NASA’s planned missions to the Moon and Mars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of website shutdown: October 3, 2023</li>
    <li>Comet in question: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Projected budget cut for NASA: from $24.8 billion to $18.8 billion</li>
    <li>Projected reduction in science projects: 33%</li>
    <li>Projected job cuts: nearly 32% of the agency's workforce</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, NASA announced the halt of website updates due to a lapse in federal funding. The announcement coincided with the expected flyby of comet 3I/Atlas, which was to be documented by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The agency's budget for 2026 has been significantly reduced, which has raised concerns among scientists about the future of NASA's missions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA is currently closed due to a lapse in government funding. Employees can visit nasa.gov/shutdown for additional information.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This budget cut will push back NASA’s space missions and plans to go to the Moon and Mars.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The reduction in NASA's budget follows an announcement by the Trump administration in May 2023, which cut the agency's funding significantly. Whistleblowers have warned that these budget cuts could lead to safety issues within the agency, potentially endangering astronauts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's website will remain closed until further notice, pending a resolution to the federal funding issue. This situation may affect ongoing and future space missions, as well as employee job security at the agency.</p>
