      <h2>Scientists detect X-ray glow from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS extending 250,000 miles into space</h2>

<p>For the first time, astronomers have detected X-ray emissions from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a glow that extends about 250,000 miles (400,000 kilometers) into space. The observations were made by the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton observatory and the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) led by Japan's JAXA, with NASA also involved in the mission. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the interactions between the comet and solar wind, allowing scientists to study gases that are otherwise difficult to detect. ESA officials have stated that these X-ray observations will help researchers understand the comet's composition and its behavior as it travels through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object in our solar system.</li>
    <li>The first X-ray observation was made by XRISM from November 26 to 28, capturing data over 17 hours.</li>
    <li>The second observation by ESA's XMM-Newton occurred on December 3 for about 20 hours.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 175–177 million miles (282–285 million kilometers) from the XMM-Newton at the time of observation.</li>
    <li>X-ray emissions were detected extending about 250,000 miles (400,000 kilometers) from the comet's nucleus.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth is expected around December 19.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 26, the XRISM telescope began observing comet 3I/ATLAS for 17 hours. This initial observation marked the first detection of X-ray emissions from the comet. The data revealed a significant glow, indicating interactions between the solar wind and the comet's gas cloud.</p>

<p>Shortly after, on December 3, the XMM-Newton observatory conducted a follow-up study of the comet for approximately 20 hours. This observation provided additional data on the comet's X-ray emissions, further illustrating the interaction of solar wind with the gases emitted by the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS presents a new opportunity to study an interstellar object, and observations in X-ray light will complement other observations to help scientists figure out what it is made of,” ESA officials said in a statement.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as the third confirmed object from outside our solar system. Previous observations of the comet have identified abundant water vapor, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide in its coma. The recent X-ray findings are expected to enhance the understanding of the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data from both the XRISM and XMM-Newton observations. Further studies will focus on understanding the physical and chemical interactions occurring as 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19.</p>
