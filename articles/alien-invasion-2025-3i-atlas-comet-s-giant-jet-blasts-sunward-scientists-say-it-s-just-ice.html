      <h2>Alien Invasion 2025? 3I/ATLAS Comet's Giant Jet Blasts Sunward—Scientists Say It's Just Ice</h2>

<p>Panic has gripped social media as whispers of an "alien invasion 2025" spread, triggered by images of a giant jet erupting from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet, which is currently approaching its perihelion, was discovered on 1 July 2025 by NASA's ATLAS telescope in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event has drawn significant attention from both astronomers and the public. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring the comet closely as it approaches the Sun, with scientists emphasizing that the jet is a natural phenomenon caused by the comet's icy composition, not extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on 1 July 2025, racing at 58 km/s.</li>
<li>Perihelion is expected on 29 October 2025 at 1.3561 AU from the Sun.</li>
<li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be 0.32–5.6 km wide.</li>
<li>Jet eruption extends over 10,000 km, primarily composed of dust and carbon dioxide.</li>
<li>Avi Loeb suggests a 30-40% chance of alien technology, while other scientists disagree.</li>
<li>NASA's SPHEREx is monitoring the comet until January 2026.</li>
<li>Comet is expected to safely pass Earth on 19 December 2025 at over 1.8 AU.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on 1 July 2025, glowing at magnitude 18 and located 3.50 AU from Earth. Precovery images from NASA's TESS date back to 7 May 2025, showing early activity. Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope on 6 August 2025 detected carbon dioxide and water emissions. A significant jet eruption was reported on 15 October 2025, and scientists continue to analyze the comet's activity as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<strong>Avi Loeb</strong> stated, "The team of NASA's SPHEREx space observatory just reported tantalizing new data on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS," suggesting potential artificial origins.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Darryl Seligman</strong> emphasized, "This is only the third such interstellar comet we've ever been able to study," noting the excitement among planetary scientists regarding the comet's natural characteristics.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object after 1I/&#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit and velocity indicate origins beyond our solar system. Previous interstellar objects have also sparked speculation about extraterrestrial life, but scientific consensus has consistently pointed to natural explanations for their characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS through the end of January 2026 to gather more data as the comet approaches Earth on 19 December 2025. Further analysis is expected as the comet reaches its perihelion on 29 October 2025.</p>
