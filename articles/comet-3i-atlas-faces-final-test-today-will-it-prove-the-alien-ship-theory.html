      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Faces Final Test Today — Will It Prove the 'Alien Ship' Theory?</h2>

<p>Today, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaches its closest point to the Sun, testing a controversial theory that it may be an alien spacecraft. The event occurs on October 29, 2023, and follows claims made by astronomer Avi Loeb regarding the comet's nature.</p>

<p>This test is significant as it could confirm or disprove Loeb's assertions about 3I/ATLAS. Since its discovery on July 1, 2023, Loeb has treated the comet as an alien ship, warning the public about potential revelations. Major space agencies, including SETI and NASA, have consistently dismissed the alien hypothesis, asserting that there is no evidence supporting it.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently 203 million kilometres (126 million miles) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet will perform an Oberth manoeuvre today, a test of its trajectory.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has previously made claims about the first interstellar object, 1I/'Oumuamua, being an alien craft.</li>
    <li>SETI and NASA have stated there is zero evidence supporting the alien ship theory.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's JUICE mission will observe the comet from deep space on Sunday.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>1. July 1, 2023: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered.</p>
<p>2. October 29, 2023: The comet reaches its closest point to the Sun, marking a critical test for the alien ship theory.</p>
<p>3. October 30, 2023: The European Space Agency's JUICE mission will begin observations of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, "If you want to take a vacation, take it before [October 29], because who knows what will happen?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>Colin Wilson of the European Space Agency said, "I think that what it actually is is probably more interesting than what we can imagine it to be because it's like a time capsule from a different era."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has previously suggested that the first interstellar object, 1I/'Oumuamua, was also an alien craft, a claim that has been met with skepticism from the scientific community. Loeb's interpretations have been labelled as baseless, with no supporting evidence found for the alien hypotheses.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>If 3I/ATLAS continues on its predicted path without deviation, the alien spacecraft theory will likely be dismissed, providing clarity on the comet's true nature.</p>
