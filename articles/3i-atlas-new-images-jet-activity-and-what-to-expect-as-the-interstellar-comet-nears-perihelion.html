      <h2>3I/ATLAS: New Images and Jet Activity as the Interstellar Comet Approaches Perihelion</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest as new images reveal a powerful jet directed toward the Sun, with perihelion expected to occur late this month. The comet, which is the third confirmed interstellar object, follows 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Researchers and skywatchers are closely monitoring its activity as it approaches its closest point to the Sun.</p>

<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS are crucial for understanding the dynamics of interstellar comets. Authorities and scientists are actively monitoring the comet's behavior and preparing for its perihelion, which will provide valuable data on its composition and activity. The recent images show a bright, sunward-pointing jet, indicating that the comet is actively evolving as it gets closer to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion date: Late October (around Oct. 29–30, 2025)</li>
    <li>Distance at perihelion: ~1.4 AU (just inside Mars’s orbit)</li>
    <li>Closest distance to Earth: ~1.8 AU</li>
    <li>No impact risk or close pass by Earth</li>
    <li>Observations indicate unusual water activity and complex jet dynamics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation as it approaches perihelion. Recent updates have highlighted:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initial observations noted the comet's bright jet directed toward the Sun.</li>
    <li>Changes in tail direction have been recorded, reflecting evolving dust dynamics.</li>
    <li>Scientists have begun to analyze unusual chemical signals, including nickel-rich indicators.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is active and evolving as sunlight intensifies, a sign that volatile ices are near the surface and responding rapidly to heat,” a researcher stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins the ranks of interstellar comets that provide insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies. Previous visitors, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have shown different characteristics, helping scientists to map the diversity of cometary bodies across star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As perihelion approaches, scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely. Observations will focus on jet activity, tail evolution, and chemical analyses, with updates expected as new data becomes available. The comet's behavior after perihelion will also be of interest, as it will reveal details about its mantle thickness and volatile composition.</p>
