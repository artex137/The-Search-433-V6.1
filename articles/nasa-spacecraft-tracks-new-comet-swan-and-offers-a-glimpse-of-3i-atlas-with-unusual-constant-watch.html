      <h2>NASA spacecraft tracks new comet SWAN and offers a glimpse of 3I/Atlas with unusual constant watch</h2>

<p>A NASA spacecraft has observed Comet C/2025 R2, known as SWAN, with unprecedented frequency over the past 40 days. The PUNCH mission recorded images of the comet every four minutes, a pace that NASA claims is likely unmatched in previous comet tracking efforts. The observations took place as the comet passed between Mars and the star Spica, reaching its closest point to Earth at approximately 25.10 million miles in late October.</p>

<p>This extensive monitoring is significant for scientists studying solar phenomena and the behavior of comets. The continuous imaging has allowed researchers to compile hundreds of images into a single video, revealing details about the comet's structure and behavior as it interacts with solar wind. Craig DeForest, the lead of the PUNCH mission, emphasized the unique speed of the imaging process, which differs from the typical daily tracking of other comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was first spotted by Ukrainian amateur astronomer Vladimir Bezugly.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion at a distance of 46.74 million miles from the Sun.</li>
    <li>SWAN passed 25.10 million miles from Earth in late October.</li>
    <li>The PUNCH mission captured images every four minutes for nearly 40 days.</li>
    <li>Early images showed a bluish green coma that later appeared triangular.</li>
    <li>The comet's tail was influenced by solar wind, which pushed it to the left.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet SWAN was first observed by Vladimir Bezugly using images from the SOHO spacecraft. The comet reached perihelion just one day after its discovery, passing at a distance of 46.74 million miles from the Sun. The PUNCH mission began its continuous imaging shortly thereafter, capturing images every four minutes for almost 40 days. In late October, the comet approached Earth, coming within 25.10 million miles, making it nearly visible to the naked eye.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The cadence of imaging for this comet is likely unmatched before,” said Craig DeForest, lead of the PUNCH mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Multiple vantage points reveal space weather fully. Such tools help protect astronauts and technology on Earth,” said Gina DiBraccio, acting director at NASA Goddard.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This extensive observation of Comet SWAN marks a shift in how comets are monitored by space agencies. Traditionally, comets have been tracked with less frequent imaging, often only once a day for years. The PUNCH mission's approach could provide new insights into the dynamics of comets and their interactions with solar wind.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the data collected from the PUNCH mission to understand better the behavior of Comet SWAN and its implications for space weather. Further observations may also focus on the interstellar visitor 3I ATLAS, which passed briefly under SWAN during the imaging sequence.</p>
