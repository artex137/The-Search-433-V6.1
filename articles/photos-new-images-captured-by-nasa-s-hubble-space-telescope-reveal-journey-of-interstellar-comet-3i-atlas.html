      <h2>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope Captures Journey of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has captured new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it sped through the solar system on November 30. The comet, first detected in summer 2025, is currently about 178 million miles from Earth and poses no threat, according to officials.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it allows astronomers to study a rare interstellar object. 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object from outside our solar system, providing insights into celestial bodies that pass through our solar system. NASA has mobilized multiple missions to monitor the comet before it continues on its trajectory and leaves the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in summer 2025.</li>
    <li>Current distance from Earth: 178 million miles.</li>
    <li>Comet will not come closer than 170 million miles to Earth.</li>
    <li>Hubble captured images using its Wide Field Camera 3 instrument.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it will not orbit the Sun.</li>
    <li>Observations are expected to continue for several more months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA first detected interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in summer 2025 using the ATLAS survey telescope based in Rio Hurtado, Chile. Since then, astronomers have tracked its movement through the solar system. The most recent images captured by Hubble on November 30 show the comet as it travels at high velocity, creating streaks of background stars in the photographs.</p>

<p>As it moves closer to the Sun, the comet is expected to turn blue, which scientists have noted as a significant characteristic of its journey.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“So we use all the tools at our disposal to observe it before it disappears back into the cosmic dark,” said a NASA official, emphasizing the importance of these observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar object identified, following similar discoveries in recent years. The ability to observe such objects provides astronomers with valuable data on the formation and evolution of celestial bodies in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue its observations of comet 3I/ATLAS over the coming months, utilizing various space telescopes to gather more information about this unique interstellar visitor.</p>
