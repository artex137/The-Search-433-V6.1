      <h2>US military footage captures multiple 'orb' UFOs flying in formation over Persian Gulf</h2>

<p>New video from a US military drone has captured three unidentified flying objects (UFOs) flying in formation over the Persian Gulf on August 23, 2012. The footage was revealed by investigative journalist Jeremy Corbell during an episode of the WEAPONIZED Podcast on January 30, 2026. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to the sighting.</p>

<p>This footage is significant as it adds to the growing body of evidence regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) in a region known for military activity. The Pentagon has officially designated these objects as UAP, a term replacing UFO. Corbell and his co-host George Knapp assert that the video demonstrates flight characteristics that defy known physics, calling into question the nature of these objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Footage recorded by an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US Air Force.</li>
    <li>Sighting occurred at approximately 6 PM local time on August 23, 2012.</li>
    <li>The video shows three orbs flying in formation over the Persian Gulf.</li>
    <li>Corbell claims the orbs displayed unusual flight movements without visible propulsion.</li>
    <li>The US Department of War has classified these objects as UAP.</li>
    <li>Corbell and Knapp describe the orbs as appearing to be intelligently coordinated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 23, 2012, a US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone recorded a minute-long video showing three orbs flying in formation over the Persian Gulf. The footage was obtained from military intelligence sources and later shared by Jeremy Corbell on the WEAPONIZED Podcast on January 30, 2026. In the video, one orb is seen moving between the other two, demonstrating acceleration without visible thrust.</p>

<p>During the podcast, Corbell and Knapp highlighted the significance of the recording, asserting that it was taken by military technology capable of capturing more data than standard cameras. They referred to the orbs as UAP, and noted that the area has seen an increase in UAP activity, with multiple encounters reported by US Navy personnel.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is a military recorded sensor generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO,” said George Knapp during the podcast. “And clearly, you watch this, and that’s not what it is.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Your government has labeled this UAP and you were never supposed to see this footage,” added Jeremy Corbell.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Persian Gulf has become a focal point for UAP sightings, with US Navy personnel reporting various encounters with bright objects in the sky. Notably, a recent incident involved a military drone striking a UFO with a missile, which reportedly bounced off without impacting the craft. This has heightened interest in UAP investigations and the Pentagon's handling of such incidents.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP sightings continue, with the Pentagon's ARRO department reviewing reported incidents. The release of further footage and findings remains uncertain as the government has stated that no physical evidence proving the existence of UFOs or extraterrestrial beings has been recovered.</p>
