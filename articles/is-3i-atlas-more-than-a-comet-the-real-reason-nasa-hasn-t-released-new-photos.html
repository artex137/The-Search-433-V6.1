      <h2>NASA's Decision Not to Release New Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Debate</h2>

<p>NASA has not released new high-resolution images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, prompting a debate among astronomers and researchers as the comet continues its journey through the Solar System. The agency attributed the delay to the ongoing federal government shutdown, which restricts public sharing of new imagery. Critics argue that transparency is crucial in scientific discovery.</p>

<p>The situation has drawn increased attention as China's Tianwen-1 orbiter has released its own images of the comet. Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has been a vocal proponent for NASA to share updated images, suggesting there is a possibility that 3I/ATLAS is not a naturally formed object. This ongoing discussion raises questions about the nature of the comet and the implications for scientific communication during government shutdowns.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Identification Date:</strong> July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>High-Resolution Images Taken:</strong> October 2, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>China's Imaging Dates:</strong> October 1 to October 4, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> 10,000 to 100,000 times dimmer than typical imaging subjects</li>
    <li><strong>Source of Images:</strong> Tianwen-1 orbiter, China National Space Administration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023. NASA captured high-resolution images of the comet on October 2, 2023, but has not released them due to the federal government shutdown. Meanwhile, the Tianwen-1 orbiter successfully captured images of the comet from October 1 to October 4, 2023, with a clearer image taken on October 3.</p>

<p>Dr. Avi Loeb has actively tracked the comet's movement and published updates, raising questions about its behavior as it approaches the Sun. His calls for NASA to release the images have sparked further discussion regarding the agency's transparency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The truth is not decided by authority. NASA has no authority over nature to tell us what nature is. I mean, it's decided by data." 
    — Dr. Avi Loeb
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "NASA is a part of the federal government, which is currently shut down. Communications that do not pertain to the safety or property of life are not exempted." 
    — NASA statement to LADbible
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "This was the first attempt to photograph such a distant and relatively dim target." 
    — China National Space Administration
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ongoing federal government shutdown has impacted NASA's ability to share scientific data with the public. This situation has raised concerns among scientists and the public about the implications of such delays on real-time discoveries. Previous instances of government shutdowns have similarly affected various federal agencies, including those involved in space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has indicated that it will release the comet imagery once the government reopens. Meanwhile, the scientific community continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS and discussions regarding its origin and behavior are likely to persist, especially with the new data from China's Tianwen-1 orbiter.</p>
