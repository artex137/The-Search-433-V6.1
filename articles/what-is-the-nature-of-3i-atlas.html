      <h2>What is the Nature of 3I/ATLAS?</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University, has raised questions about the nature of comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object currently traversing the inner solar system. His observations suggest that 3I/ATLAS may possess unusual characteristics that challenge conventional scientific understanding.</p>

<p>Loeb's concerns are significant as they could reshape our understanding of celestial objects and their origins. He has called for more open-minded research into the anomalies surrounding 3I/ATLAS, emphasizing the need to explore whether it is of natural or technological origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>3I/ATLAS was imaged on July 21, 2025, by the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
<li>It has been noted to shed materials composed of nickel alloys without iron.</li>
<li>The object follows a path aligned with the ecliptic plane of the planets.</li>
<li>Loeb has co-authored a study on the object's anomalously high mass, which is currently blocked from public view by arXiv moderators.</li>
<li>The HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is expected to capture a high-resolution image of 3I/ATLAS on October 3, 2025.</li>
<li>The object will be approximately 29 million kilometers from the HiRISE camera during the observation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, Hubble Space Telescope captured the first high-resolution image of 3I/ATLAS. Following this, Loeb published a paper discussing the anomalies associated with the object, including its mass and material composition. However, this paper has faced delays in publication.</p>
<p>On October 3, 2025, the HiRISE camera is set to achieve a pixel resolution of 30 kilometers, which will provide further insights into 3I/ATLAS's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The most pressing question about the nature of 3I/ATLAS is whether it is natural or technological in origin,” said Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Anomalies are ignored, and attempts to explain them using known physics are sidelined,” he added, criticizing current academic attitudes.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This inquiry into 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of the first recognized interstellar object, 1I/`Oumuamua, which did not exhibit a tail. The discourse surrounding these objects has become contentious, with some scientists insisting on traditional classifications that may overlook significant anomalies.</p>
<p>Loeb argues that the scientific community's reluctance to explore unconventional ideas is detrimental. He believes that such a mindset could prevent the discovery of important insights about our cosmic environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb is advocating for further research into 3I/ATLAS and aims to obtain clearer images that could provide additional data on its nature. He stresses the importance of remaining open to new interpretations of unusual celestial phenomena.</p>
