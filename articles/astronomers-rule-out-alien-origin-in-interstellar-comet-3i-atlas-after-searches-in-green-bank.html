      <h2>Astronomers rule out alien origin in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after searches in Green Bank</h2>

<p>Astronomers from the Breakthrough Listen project have ruled out the possibility of an extraterrestrial origin for the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after conducting detailed observations with the Green Bank radio telescope in West Virginia. The study took place in December 2025, during the comet's closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it confirms that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a natural celestial body. Authorities have conducted extensive searches for artificial signals, which have not been detected, reinforcing the comet's natural characteristics. The study contributes to the understanding of interstellar objects and their compositions, offering insights into planetary formation processes beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
  <li>It made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 1.8 astronomical units.</li>
  <li>The Breakthrough Listen project used the Green Bank telescope, a 100-meter dish operating in a low radio noise zone.</li>
  <li>Researchers scanned frequencies between 1 and 12 GHz for potential technosignatures.</li>
  <li>No artificial signals were detected during the study.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was identified on July 1, 2025, while already within the inner solar system. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicated an interstellar origin. On December 18, 2025, the Green Bank telescope was directed to observe the comet. The closest approach occurred on December 19, 2025, when it reached 1.8 astronomical units from Earth. The observations confirmed the absence of artificial signals, supporting the conclusion that the comet is a natural object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “The absence of signals in 3I/ATLAS does not eliminate the possibility in other objects, but it sets strict limits for this specific case,” a representative from the Breakthrough Listen project stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS follows the detection of the first confirmed interstellar object, 1I/’Oumuamua, in 2017. This discovery shifted the understanding of interstellar objects and their dynamics. The second object, 2I/Borisov, was identified in 2019 and exhibited characteristics typical of comets, including a coma and tail. The ongoing research into interstellar objects supports advancements in detecting and understanding these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue to refine methods for searching for extraterrestrial intelligence. Upcoming projects like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are expected to enhance detection rates of interstellar objects, potentially identifying dozens per decade.</p>
