      <h2>Astronomer Avi Loeb warns world not to ignore new comet’s potential alien threat</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has raised alarms about the comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar visitor to our solar system, which is predicted to pass approximately 267 million kilometres from Earth in December 2023. Loeb has suggested that the comet, estimated to be one or two city blocks wide, could pose a potential threat to humanity. NASA has dismissed his claims.</p>

<p>This warning comes as Loeb points to what he describes as multiple anomalies related to 3I/ATLAS. He draws parallels between this situation and past instances where intelligence was overlooked, citing the October 7 warnings from Israeli intelligence about Hamas as an example of ignored anomalies. He believes that academia should not be so skeptical about the comet’s implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass Earth in December 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be one or two city blocks wide.</li>
    <li>Loeb claims the object’s mass is approximately one million times greater than ‘Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>NASA has publicly dismissed Loeb's claims regarding the comet.</li>
    <li>Loeb's previous work on ‘Oumuamua raised similar controversies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, Avi Loeb first gained attention for his theories surrounding ‘Oumuamua, the first interstellar object known to humanity. He described it as having a pancake-like shape, which raised questions about its origins.</p>
<p>On October 28, 2023, Loeb appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast, where he compared 3I/ATLAS to a tennis ball thrown into a backyard, suggesting it could be a sign of extraterrestrial technology. He also invited Kim Kardashian to join his research team after she expressed interest in the comet.</p>
<p>Loeb has continued to advocate for the examination of 3I/ATLAS’s anomalies, stating that its path and composition are unusual and warrant further attention.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Suppose this is a visit from alien technology to the solar system. It’s something we should all know about. It would change everything... Even if the probability is small, we must consider such scenarios as 3I/ATLAS being a threat.” 
    <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb's theories have often been met with skepticism within the scientific community. His previous analysis of ‘Oumuamua led to heated debates about the nature of interstellar objects. Loeb argues that the scientific community should maintain an open mind about unusual astronomical phenomena, as ignoring them could lead to missed opportunities for discovery.</p>
<p>Loeb's recent comments have reignited discussions about the importance of vigilance regarding potential extraterrestrial threats, a topic that has significant implications for future scientific research and public awareness.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb continues to promote the study of 3I/ATLAS and its potential implications. He has submitted academic papers regarding the comet, although some of his more provocative claims have been met with resistance from his peers. Further analysis and observations of 3I/ATLAS are anticipated as its December approach draws near.</p>
