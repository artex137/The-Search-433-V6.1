      <h2>A radio signal from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS finally disproves that it is an extraterrestrial spacecraft</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, detected in July by the Chilean Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Warning System (ATLAS) observatory, has been confirmed as a natural celestial object. A radio signal captured by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa on October 24 has provided evidence that discredits earlier speculations of it being an extraterrestrial spacecraft.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it clarifies the nature of 3I/ATLAS amidst widespread intrigue and speculation. The signal, identified as an absorption of radio waves caused by hydroxyl (OH) molecules, confirms the presence of water ice in the comet’s nucleus. According to Michael Küppers, a scientist at the European Space Agency (ESA), this observation aligns with what is typical for comets and reinforces that the object is natural.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected in July 2025 by ATLAS observatory in Chile.</li>
    <li>Radio signal captured on October 24, 2025, by MeerKAT telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>Location of MeerKAT: 600 kilometers from Cape Town.</li>
    <li>Signal indicates presence of hydroxyl molecules from sublimating water ice.</li>
    <li>Michael Küppers is a scientist at ESA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025, sparking discussions about its origin. Observations continued, culminating in the detection of a radio signal on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT radio telescope.</p>
<p>This signal has been interpreted as evidence of the comet’s natural composition, specifically the presence of water ice, confirming its classification as a standard comet rather than an artificial object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This observation confirms that one of the main components of the comet’s nucleus ices is water, which is normal for a comet,” said Michael Küppers, scientist at the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS has generated considerable interest in the scientific community, particularly regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life. Previous objects, such as the interstellar object Oumuamua, have also sparked speculation. However, the findings regarding 3I/ATLAS highlight the importance of scientific evidence in understanding celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and studies will continue to assess 3I/ATLAS and similar celestial bodies to enhance our understanding of their composition and behavior. No additional details on upcoming investigations have been disclosed.</p>
