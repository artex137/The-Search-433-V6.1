      <h2>NASA Official Issues Statement on 3I/ATLAS as Images Reveal the Interstellar Object Has 'Grown' a Striking New Feature</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured new images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, revealing that it has developed a tail, marking it as the fastest comet ever observed. The images were obtained using the Gemini South telescope in the Chilean Andes, and show not only the comet's tail but also its glowing coma, which consists of dust and gas surrounding the object.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it adds to the evidence supporting 3I/ATLAS's classification as an interstellar comet. NASA scientist Tom Statler has stated that indications confirm it behaves like a comet, despite ongoing speculation about its nature. The findings are part of ongoing studies that analyze the chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: 3.5 miles</li>
    <li>Location of observations: Gemini South telescope, Chile</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to Earth: Next month</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Observations made recently by astronomers using the Gemini South telescope have revealed a new tail and a glowing coma. The analysis has provided insights into the object’s chemical composition and its behavior as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is behaving like a comet, with no evidence supporting the notion that it could be a technological artifact. Speculations have arisen during its journey through the Solar System, but authorities have emphasized its natural characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We were excited to see the growth of the tail, suggesting a change in the particles from the previous Gemini images, and we got our first glimpse of the chemistry from the spectrum,” said Karen Meech from the University of Hawai‘i Institute for Astronomy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It has some interesting properties that are a little bit different from our solar system comets, but it behaves like a comet,” said Tom Statler, Lead Scientist for Solar System Small Bodies at NASA’s Washington Headquarters.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System. Its predecessors, 1I/ʻOumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, have also sparked interest and speculation regarding their origins. The recent observations add to the growing body of evidence that characterizes 3I/ATLAS as a natural celestial body.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest pass to Earth, researchers will continue to monitor its trajectory and gather data on its composition and behavior. Further studies are expected to provide additional insights into this unique interstellar object.</p>
