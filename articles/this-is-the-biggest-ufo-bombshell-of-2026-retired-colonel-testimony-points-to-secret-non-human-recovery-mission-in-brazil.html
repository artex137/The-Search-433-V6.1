      <h2>'This is the biggest UFO bombshell of 2026': Retired colonel testimony points to secret non-human recovery mission in Brazil</h2>

<p>A retired US Air Force colonel has claimed there is substantial evidence supporting the existence of a UFO recovery mission in Brazil in 1996. Colonel Fred Claussen made the statement during a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington on January 21, 2026. He addressed the alleged incident involving a UFO crash in Varginha, Brazil, which reportedly included sightings of non-human entities.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked renewed interest in the Varginha incident, often referred to as the "Brazilian Roswell." Authorities and UFO researchers are now urging former military personnel to come forward with information regarding the events that transpired three decades ago. Claussen emphasized that the alleged recovery operation would have left a "paper trail" involving numerous military personnel and orders.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: January 13, 1996</li>
    <li>Location: Varginha, Brazil</li>
    <li>Key witness: Colonel Fred Claussen, retired US Air Force</li>
    <li>Reported sightings: Strange creatures and a cigar-shaped UFO</li>
    <li>Involved agencies: US Air Force, Brazilian military and police</li>
    <li>Reported death: Brazilian police officer Marco Eli Chereze due to an alleged alien-related injury</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 13, 1996, witnesses in Varginha reported seeing a damaged cigar-shaped UFO crash in a field, followed by sightings of creatures described as having oily brown skin and large red eyes. Over the following days, Brazilian authorities allegedly captured at least two of these beings.</p>
<p>Witness Carlos de Souza reported finding debris from the crash and claimed he was threatened by men in suits to remain silent. On January 20, three young women encountered an alien being, leading to the capture of at least two entities by Brazilian police, including Marco Eli Chereze, who later died from an infection.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If true, I am certain that 30 to 40 Americans had direct knowledge of this flight and its purpose,” Claussen said during the press conference.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We know this mission happened, and you know it, too. Come forward. The time is now,” he added, addressing former military personnel.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Varginha incident has been a point of contention and fascination for UFO enthusiasts for over 30 years. It is often compared to the Roswell incident in the United States, where a supposed UFO crash led to similar claims of a cover-up. Despite numerous witness accounts, the US military has consistently denied any evidence of UFOs or alien life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims made by Claussen and other witnesses are expected to continue. UFO researchers are calling for transparency and urging former military personnel with knowledge of the incident to step forward.</p>
