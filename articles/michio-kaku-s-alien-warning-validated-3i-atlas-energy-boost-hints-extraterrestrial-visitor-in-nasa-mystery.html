      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-29 07:26 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS Energy Boost Raises Speculation of Extraterrestrial Origins</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has surprised astronomers with an unexpected energy boost, prompting discussions about potential extraterrestrial origins. The comet was detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope, marking its entry as the third known interstellar object in our solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges current understanding of interstellar visitors. Authorities, including NASA and astronomers worldwide, are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with its closest encounter expected on 19 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Passed close to the Sun on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Psyche mission captured images of the comet on 8 and 9 September 2025.</li>
    <li>New measurements on 24 November 2025 detected an acceleration of 4 × 10<sup>-11</sup> au/day<sup>2</sup>.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth expected on 19 December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS telescope. The comet, estimated to be seven billion years old, exhibited unusual properties, including high nickel and iron levels. It passed near the Sun on 29 October 2025, displaying multiple jets and an odd composition.</p>
<p>NASA's Psyche mission captured detailed images of 3I/ATLAS on 8 and 9 September 2025, when the comet was approximately 33 million miles (53 million kilometres) from Earth. Between 1 and 7 October 2025, the ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter refined its trajectory.</p>
<p>On 24 November 2025, new measurements revealed an acceleration that aligned with concerns expressed by physicist Michio Kaku regarding potential extraterrestrial signals.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“So, watch for it. On October 30th, starting then, we're going to track it to see whether it gets an extra boost of energy. If so, it means we are being visited,” said Michio Kaku in October 2025.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the latest findings, Michio Kaku had dismissed theories of alien origins, referring to them as 'garbage'. However, as evidence has emerged, his stance has evolved, now acknowledging the possibility of extraterrestrial signals linked to the comet's behaviour. Avi Loeb has also advocated for 3I/ATLAS as a potential sign of alien technology, raising questions within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The focus will be on gathering more data to determine the nature of its energy boost and its implications for the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
