      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Shows Signs Of Cryovolcanic Activity</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting signs of cryovolcanic activity as it approaches the Sun, according to a study published on December 2, 2025. Researchers have observed this activity using the 80 cm Joan Oró Telescope at Montsec Observatory in Spain. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may provide insights into the composition and behavior of comets from interstellar space. The team, led by Josep M. Trigo-Rodríguez, has combined detailed imaging with spectral data to analyze 3I/ATLAS’s structure and activity. Observations indicate that the comet is a metal-rich, carbonaceous body reacting to increasing temperatures as it nears the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching perihelion, which occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
  <li>The study utilized the 80 cm Joan Oró Telescope and other regional facilities in Spain.</li>
  <li>High-resolution images show tightly wound spiral jets and knots in the comet's coma.</li>
  <li>The comet is believed to have a significant amount of water ice mixed into its outer layers.</li>
  <li>The research suggests that the comet's behavior resembles cryovolcanism observed on ice-rich bodies in the outer Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, marking its closest approach to the Sun. Prior to this, the research team conducted extensive imaging and spectral analysis using the Joan Oró Telescope to monitor the comet's activity. The study findings were publicly released on December 2, 2025.</p>

<p>The team compared the comet's spectrum with Antarctic carbonaceous chondrites from NASA’s collection to determine its composition. This comparison indicated that 3I/ATLAS is rich in carbon and native metals, which are crucial for understanding its cryovolcanic activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is consistent with cryovolcanism seen on ice-rich bodies in the outer Solar System,” said Josep M. Trigo-Rodríguez, the lead researcher. “This provides a unique opportunity to study icy bodies from another system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The findings support previous indications that 3I/ATLAS has been altered by radiation exposure, possibly for an extended period. This long exposure complicates the reconstruction of the comet's initial composition. The study enriches our understanding of small, volatile-rich worlds that may exist around other stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Follow-up observations are planned as comet 3I/ATLAS moves away from the Sun. Researchers aim to determine whether the proposed cryovolcanic processes align with the comet's activity as it fades over time.</p>
