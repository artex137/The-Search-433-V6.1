      <h2>8 Burning Theories That Could Prove 3I/ATLAS is an Alien Spacecraft, According to Harvard Scientist</h2>

<p>Speculation continues about the nature of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from Earth, with Harvard scientist Avi Loeb asserting that it may be technological in origin. NASA has stated that the comet is of cometary provenance, but Loeb has maintained his position following the comet's closest approach on December 19, 2025. He has expressed concerns over unexplained anomalies that could indicate an artificial source.</p>

<p>The debate over 3I/ATLAS is significant as it raises questions about the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence and the implications for future space exploration. Loeb has called for further investigation and analysis of the comet's characteristics, particularly during its upcoming approach to Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has ranked 3I/ATLAS a four on his scale of potential technological origins.</li>
    <li>The International Asteroid Warning Network's Planetary Defense campaign is set to collect data from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Jupiter in March 2026, at a distance of 53,445 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Loeb has identified 15 theories regarding the comet's unusual characteristics, with eight being particularly noteworthy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Avi Loeb first ranked 3I/ATLAS on his scale assessing the potential for alien technology. Following the comet's closest approach on December 19, 2025, he reaffirmed his stance in an interview with NewsNation.</p>
<p>Loeb has called for increased surveillance during 3I/ATLAS's upcoming close approach to Jupiter in March 2026, suggesting the use of existing spacecraft to monitor the comet for any unusual activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You can’t just say, ‘I know the answer and ignore the anomalies. That’s not viable,” Loeb told The Post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“My general hope is that the best is yet to come in terms of the new data and what we will learn about 3I/ATLAS,” he concluded.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb's theories regarding 3I/ATLAS follow a history of speculation about unidentified objects in space, including the previous interstellar visitors 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. His claims have sparked discussions in the scientific community about the need for more rigorous investigation of potential extraterrestrial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the Planetary Defense campaign progresses, researchers will analyze data collected on 3I/ATLAS to determine its origins and characteristics. The findings may influence future space exploration strategies and the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
