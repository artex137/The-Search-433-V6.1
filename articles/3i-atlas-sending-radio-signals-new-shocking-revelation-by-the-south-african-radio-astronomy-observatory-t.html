      <h2>3I/ATLAS sending radio signals? New shocking revelation by the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported that the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory has detected radio frequency patterns from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. This confirmation follows the comet's closest approach to the sun, known as perihelion, which occurred on October 29, 2025, at approximately 203 million kilometers from the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides more evidence supporting the natural origin of 3I/ATLAS amidst various theories and speculations. Researchers are investigating the implications of these radio signals, which could enhance understanding of the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 203 million kilometers (126 million miles) from the sun at perihelion.</li>
    <li>The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory operates the MeerKAT telescope, which detected the radio frequency patterns.</li>
    <li>The detected frequencies were at 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz, consistent with typical comet activity.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object identified.</li>
    <li>Observations of 3I/ATLAS began on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2025, pre-discovery observations of 3I/ATLAS were collected from various telescopes. The comet was officially reported on July 1, 2025, to the Minor Planet Center. Following these observations, the comet reached its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>Recent developments have emerged as the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory confirmed the detection of radio frequency patterns from 3I/ATLAS, suggesting ongoing comet activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The apparent signal isn't a radio signal like a transmission emitted by a spacecraft. It's instead a radio frequency pattern detected by MeerKAT.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The hydroxyl radical (OH) has the ability to absorb or emit radiation at specific frequencies due to transitions in its energy levels.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as the third known interstellar object, following previous discoveries that have intrigued scientists about the origins of such comets. The naming convention reflects its origin, with "I" denoting its interstellar nature.</p>

<p>Prior research on comets has established that they can exhibit unique behaviors when approaching the sun, such as sublimating ice and altering their trajectories due to increased radiation exposure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the radio frequency patterns detected by MeerKAT. They aim to enhance understanding of 3I/ATLAS and its characteristics as further observations and studies are conducted.</p>
