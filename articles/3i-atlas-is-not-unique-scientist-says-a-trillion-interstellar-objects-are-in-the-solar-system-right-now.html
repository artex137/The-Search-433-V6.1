      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-30 13:03 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS is not unique: Scientist says a trillion interstellar objects are in the solar system right now</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, has stated that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is not unique, suggesting there could be a trillion similar objects currently in the solar system. This statement was made during a discussion on the findings of 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on July 1 by the ATLAS observatory in Chile.</p>

<p>This information is significant as it reshapes our understanding of interstellar objects and their frequency in our solar system. According to Loeb, over a billion such objects have visited Earth throughout its history. The classification of 3I/ATLAS as a comet by NASA, ESA, and other agencies highlights the ongoing interest in studying these celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS observatory in Chile.</li>
    <li>It has been traveling through the solar system for over 8,000 years.</li>
    <li>Loeb estimates there are a trillion similar objects in the solar system.</li>
    <li>Over a billion interstellar objects have visited Earth during its lifetime.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS follows a hyperbolic path, indicating it is not bound by the Sun's gravity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the ATLAS observatory in Chile discovered 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, scientists, including Avi Loeb, analyzed its trajectory and classified it as a comet. They noted its hyperbolic path, which suggested it originated from outside the solar system. Loeb has since calculated the potential number of similar interstellar objects present in the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Given that 3I/ATLAS was discovered at a distance of ~5 AU in a survey that lasted 5 years, I calculate that there should be a trillion objects like 3I/ATLAS in the solar system right now!"</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This revelation by Loeb places 3I/ATLAS within a broader context of interstellar research. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100 billion stars, which could produce vast numbers of interstellar objects over billions of years. This finding aligns with the growing interest in understanding the frequency and impact of such objects on Earth and other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further studies are expected to continue as scientists explore the implications of Loeb's findings. Ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS and similar objects may yield more data on their origins and trajectories.</p>
