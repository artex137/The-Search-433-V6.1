      <h2>3I/ATLAS Reveals Dramatic Tail Reappearance</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has unveiled a bright and sharply defined tail, surprising astronomers worldwide just weeks after it appeared to lose it entirely. The new observations were made by the Virtual Telescope Project in Italy on November 10 at 11:31 p.m. EDT (04:31 GMT on November 11).</p>

<p>This development is significant as it revives scientific interest in 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet detected to date. The new findings suggest a complex evolution of the comet, prompting further investigation into its behavior as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS displayed a newly defined ion tail on November 10, 2023.</li>
    <li>The observations were made by the Virtual Telescope Project in Italy.</li>
    <li>The tail extends nearly 0.7 degrees across the sky.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to encounter Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
    <li>This is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early November 2023, astronomers noted the disappearance of 3I/ATLAS's tail, a rare occurrence for a comet heated by solar radiation. Following this puzzling event, scientists captured new images of the comet, revealing a longer, brighter, and more structured tail on November 10.</p>
<p>The new observations come after challenges, including the comet's low position in the sky and interference from a 61 per cent illuminated Moon. Despite these conditions, astronomers successfully documented the comet's tail, marking a significant turnaround in their study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We imaged the interstellar comet again, recording a much more developed ion tail,” said Gianluca Masi, who leads the Virtual Telescope Project. “The tail is now appearing better and better.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb noted that nearly “13 per cent of the comet’s mass should appear as a tail,” highlighting the initial absence of this expected feature.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object, which provides valuable insights into planetary systems beyond our solar system. Previous interstellar visitors, such as 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also contributed to the understanding of the composition and behavior of celestial objects from other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it progresses toward its encounter with Jupiter in March 2026. The renewed activity of the comet indicates a potential for further discoveries about its composition and the mechanisms that govern its behavior.</p>
