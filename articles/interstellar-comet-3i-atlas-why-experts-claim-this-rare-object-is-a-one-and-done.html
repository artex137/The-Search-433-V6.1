      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Why Experts Claim This Rare Object Is A 'One-And-Done'</h2>

<p>A 33-billion-ton interstellar comet, known as 3I/ATLAS, is set to make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, at a distance of 167 million miles. This ancient object, which is older than the sun, presents a unique opportunity for scientific study, but poses no threat to our planet.</p>

<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS has sparked significant interest among astronomers due to its unusual characteristics, particularly its 'anti-tail.' Experts are currently using advanced telescopes to gather data on this rare visitor, which is the third interstellar object detected in the solar system in the last decade.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 167 million miles.</li>
    <li>Comet is older than the sun, estimated at 4.6 billion years.</li>
    <li>NASA is using the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes for observations.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently on a 'fully hyperbolic orbit.'</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been identified as an interstellar comet, having entered the solar system as a unique visitor. Its trajectory has been tracked using various telescopes, which are capturing images and data ahead of its closest approach.</p>
<p>The comet's unusual 'anti-tail' has generated discussions among astronomers who are investigating the reasons behind this phenomenon. Observations are ongoing as experts gather more information about 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>As it approaches Earth, the comet will remain invisible to amateur telescopes, with its brightness measured at a 13th magnitude.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It'll be 167 million miles away from us,” explained Max Gilbraith, the planetarium coordinator at the University of Wyoming. “Since this is an interstellar comet, the chances it has ever gone around a star are probably zero.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We wouldn't have noticed these objects before because we didn't have the technology to see them,” Gilbraith added, highlighting advancements in observational technology.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object discovered in the solar system in the past decade, following other significant discoveries. Its unique composition and trajectory provide insights into the materials present in the early universe.</p>
<p>The comet's 'anti-tail' is a rare occurrence in comet behavior, prompting further investigation into its origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to collect data from 3I/ATLAS until its departure from the solar system. The findings may contribute to a better understanding of interstellar objects and the early solar system, as experts analyze the information gathered during its brief visit.</p>
