      <h2>UFO hovering over US Capitol? Viral snapshot fuels UFO craze after Congressional hearings</h2>

<p>A viral snapshot showing an unidentified flying object (UFO) hovering over the U.S. Capitol has sparked renewed interest in UFO sightings following recent Congressional hearings on the topic. The image, which has circulated widely on social media, has not been confirmed by any authorities as a legitimate depiction of a UFO.</p>

<p>This situation comes in the wake of Congressional hearings that have drawn attention to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Officials are reviewing the implications of the hearings and the public's growing curiosity about UFOs. The U.S. government has previously acknowledged the existence of UAPs, leading to increased transparency and investigations into these sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Viral snapshot taken over U.S. Capitol, not dated.</li>
    <li>Recent Congressional hearings have focused on unidentified aerial phenomena.</li>
    <li>U.S. government has acknowledged the existence of UAPs.</li>
    <li>Public interest in UFOs has surged following the hearings.</li>
    <li>No official confirmation of the snapshot's authenticity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, several Congressional hearings have been held regarding UAPs, prompting discussions on government transparency and the need for further investigations. Following these hearings, social media platforms have seen a surge in posts and discussions about UFO sightings, particularly the viral snapshot over the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>The snapshot has prompted various reactions online, including both skepticism and excitement, as users share their interpretations and analyses of the image.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The attention on UFOs has grown significantly after the recent hearings, and we are committed to providing transparency on this issue,” a government spokesperson said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The renewed interest in UFOs follows a series of Congressional hearings where military officials testified about their encounters with UAPs. This has led to a shift in how the government approaches the topic of unidentified phenomena, with a focus on declassification and public reporting.</p>
<p>Historically, the U.S. government has been reticent about UFOs, but recent developments have encouraged a more open dialogue regarding these sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the viral snapshot and other UAP sightings are expected to continue. Authorities are likely to assess the implications of the public's interest and any potential security concerns surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
