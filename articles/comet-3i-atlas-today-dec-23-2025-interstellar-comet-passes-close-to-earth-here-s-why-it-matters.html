      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Today (Dec. 23, 2025): Interstellar Comet Passes Close to Earth</h2>

<p>On December 19, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, coming within approximately 270 million kilometers (168 million miles) of the planet. The event has garnered significant attention from the scientific community, providing a rare opportunity for astronomers to study the comet in detail.</p>

<p>The close encounter allows researchers to gather clearer data on the comet's characteristics. Astronomers have emphasized the importance of this event as it represents a unique observational window for studying an interstellar object. They have conducted extensive observations to analyze the comet's behavior and composition, which may enhance understanding of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed within 270 million kilometers of Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered during a routine data check in July 2025 by astronomer Larry Denneau.</li>
    <li>The closest approach occurred in the early hours of December 19.</li>
    <li>A live broadcast of the event was hosted by astrophysicist Gianluca Masi and organized by the Virtual Telescope Project.</li>
    <li>Observations at the Teide Observatory in Spain detected a rotating gas and dust jet from the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet's spin period has been estimated to be between 14 and 17 hours.</li>
    <li>X-ray emissions from the comet extend nearly 400,000 kilometers from its center, confirmed by the XRISM satellite.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 by Larry Denneau during a routine observation of the ATLAS monitoring system. Initial scans suggested it was an ordinary near-planet body. Further analysis revealed it to be an interstellar comet, prompting increased observation efforts.</p>
<p>As the comet approached Earth, astronomers prepared for its closest pass on December 19. A live broadcast was scheduled for December 18, allowing the public to watch the event online. Weather conditions played a crucial role in visibility for observers.</p>
<p>Following its closest approach, Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey beyond the reach of Earth, moving farther out of view.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This close encounter provides a significant edge for a direct measurement of its rotation rate,” said a spokesperson from the Teide Observatory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The data we gather from this comet will help us understand the material released by interacting gases,” noted a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as the third large interstellar object recorded entering our planetary system. Previous interstellar comets have provided insights into the origins of material in our solar system. The study of such comets is crucial for understanding the dynamics of celestial bodies beyond our immediate environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected during the comet's close approach. Ongoing observations will focus on its spectral structure and the behavior of its gas and dust jets as it moves away from Earth.</p>
