      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS, third confirmed interstellar, approaches Earth without risk</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object, reached its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers. The event posed no risk of collision, allowing astronomers from various institutions to conduct detailed observations of the comet.</p>

<p>This approach is significant as it provides a unique opportunity to study the chemical composition of an interstellar object. Various space missions, including those from NASA and ESA, have been monitoring 3I/ATLAS, contributing to the understanding of its properties and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached: October 29, 2025, at 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Speed: Over 200,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter: Between 0.6 and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet shows a coma dominated by carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>Previous observations: Not disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Pre-discovery observations date back to June 2025 when the object passed through dense star fields in the Milky Way. Initial analyses confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating an origin outside the Solar System.</p>

<p>On October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, becoming more active and forming tails of ions and dust. Renewed observations occurred after it emerged from behind the Sun in December, culminating in its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS provides a rare opportunity to study materials from outside our Solar System,” said a representative from NASA. “We have observed no risks associated with its trajectory.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the interstellar comets ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, marking it as the third confirmed object of its kind. Observations of 3I/ATLAS have challenged existing models of planetary formation due to its carbon dioxide-dominated activity.</p>

<p>The comet's unusual characteristics, including its chemical composition and stable brightness, have led experts to emphasize its natural origins, dismissing earlier speculations about an artificial source.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research based on data collected from 3I/ATLAS will continue for years, focusing on analyzing spectra and images. The findings will enhance understanding of the population of interstellar objects within the Milky Way and refine detection techniques for future interstellar visitors.</p>
