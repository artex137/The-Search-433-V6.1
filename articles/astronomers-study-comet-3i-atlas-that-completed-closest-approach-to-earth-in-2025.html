      <h2>Astronomers study comet 3I/ATLAS that completed closest approach to Earth in 2025</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has completed its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing at a distance of 270 million kilometers. There were no injuries or fatalities reported as the comet posed no risk of collision.</p>

<p>This event marks a significant opportunity for the scientific community to gather valuable data about interstellar objects. Authorities, including NASA, have mobilized a network of telescopes and space missions to monitor 3I/ATLAS, which is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 270 million kilometers (1.8 astronomical units)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025, at approximately 210 million kilometers from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated diameter:</strong> Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Relative speed:</strong> Greater than 200,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Next destination:</strong> A distant rendezvous with Jupiter in 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS telescope system discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Initial observations indicated an unusual trajectory, suggesting it originated from outside the solar system. This classification was confirmed through subsequent global analyses.</p>

<p>The comet passed its perihelion on October 29, 2025, exhibiting an increase in brightness due to sublimation of ice. Following this, it approached Earth on December 19, 2025, before heading towards Jupiter in 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS provides a unique opportunity to study primordial material from other stars and understand distant cosmic phenomena,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic trajectory, with an orbital eccentricity greater than 1, confirms that it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun, distinguishing it from native comets and asteroids.</p>

<p>The rarity of such interstellar visitors enhances the scientific value of current observations, particularly regarding the chemical diversity in interstellar space and the conditions for the formation of planetary systems in other regions of the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data collected from 3I/ATLAS will continue to be analyzed in the coming years. This research aims to improve theoretical models on the formation and evolution of interstellar objects and expand our understanding of cosmic phenomena.</p>
