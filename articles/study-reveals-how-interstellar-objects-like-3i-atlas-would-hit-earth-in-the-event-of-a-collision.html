      <h2>Study reveals how interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS would hit Earth in the event of a collision</h2>

<p>A study published this week has detailed the arrival patterns of interstellar objects at Earth in the event of a collision. Researchers have simulated impacts at an average speed of 72 km/s, higher than most meteoroids from the Solar System. The study, which analyzed millions of virtual trajectories, identifies key times and regions likely to experience such impacts.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances understanding of the risks posed by interstellar objects. Authorities are now better equipped to assess potential threats and develop monitoring strategies for future events.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Average impact speed of 72 km/s for interstellar objects.</li>
    <li>Winter in the Northern Hemisphere records the highest number of simulated impacts.</li>
    <li>Two key regions in the sky identified for potential impacts: solar apex and galactic plane.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS, observed in 2025, recorded a speed of 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>Three interstellar visitors have been confirmed: 1I/‘Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, 1I/‘Oumuamua was discovered, measuring approximately 80 meters in size. In 2019, 2I/Borisov was identified with a core of about 400 meters. The latest interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, was observed in 2025, traveling at a speed of 58 km/s. The study published this week utilizes these known interstellar objects to calibrate its models.</p>

<p>Researchers generated 26 billion synthetic objects to analyze the motion of M dwarf stars and the gravitational effects of the Sun, aiming to map potential impact distributions without estimating absolute frequency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The results highlight the significant role of solar gravity in influencing the trajectories of these interstellar objects,” the authors stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous incidents involving interstellar objects have raised questions about Earth’s vulnerability to such collisions. The research shows that the gravitational focus exerted by the Sun increases the likelihood of these objects crossing Earth’s orbit. Additionally, the study indicates that impacts are more common in low latitudes, particularly during the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor the trajectories of interstellar objects and assess the implications of this research for potential future impacts. Further studies are expected to refine the understanding of these risks and enhance predictive capabilities.</p>
