      <h2>In Photos: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS tours our solar system</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been traveling through our solar system since July, drawing significant interest from astronomers and space enthusiasts. The comet is set to fly by Earth on December 19 at a distance of approximately 170 million miles. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's trajectory.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed object to enter our solar system from elsewhere in the galaxy. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are actively capturing images and data from various spacecraft to study the comet's characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its closest point to the sun at the end of October 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to fly by Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency have used multiple spacecraft, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, to capture images of the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 420 million miles away when first spotted and around 178 million miles away during the latest observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS system in Chile, when it was about 420 million miles from Earth. Observations continued throughout the months, with NASA's SPHEREx observatory studying the comet from August 7 to August 15, revealing its chemical composition.</p>

<p>In October, the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured images of the comet while it was approximately 18.6 million miles from Mars. NASA later released images taken from late September through mid-October, showcasing the comet's tail and its illuminated appearance.</p>

<p>On November 30, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope reobserved 3I/ATLAS, capturing it as a luminous point against a backdrop of stars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations have provided scientists with new details about the object’s size, physical properties, and chemical composition,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These new images add to a growing collection that has sparked fascination about the interstellar visitor,” an ESA representative stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Only two other objects have been confirmed to enter our solar system from outside: the cigar-shaped Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS helps scientists understand the composition and dynamics of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey out of the solar system. Observations will focus on the comet's physical characteristics and any changes as it moves further away from the sun.</p>
