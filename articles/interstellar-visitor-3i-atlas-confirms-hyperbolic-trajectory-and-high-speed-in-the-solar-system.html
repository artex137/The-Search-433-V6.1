      <p class="byline">Published 2026-01-05 21:46 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar visitor 3I/Atlas confirms hyperbolic trajectory and high speed in the solar system</h2>

<p>A new cosmic object, comet 3I/Atlas, has been confirmed as the third interstellar visitor detected by astronomers, moving through our solar system at a speed of 57 kilometers per second. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory indicates its extrasolar origin, as it has enough energy to escape the Sun's gravitational pull after a single pass.</p>

<p>This discovery highlights the presence of numerous objects ejected from their home star systems, challenging the notion that interstellar space is empty. Observing 3I/Atlas provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study materials from other stars, enhancing our understanding of planetary system formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas moves at a speed of <strong>57 km/s</strong>.</li>
    <li>It has a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it will not return to the solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, following <strong>1I/’Oumuamua</strong> and <strong>2I/Borisov</strong>.</li>
    <li>Observatories worldwide are monitoring its trajectory and composition.</li>
    <li>Data collection includes spectroscopy to analyze its chemical composition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been detected as it crosses the solar system, confirming its status as an interstellar object. Observations have focused on its trajectory and speed, which are crucial for understanding its origin and nature.</p>

<p>Since its detection, astronomers have utilized various telescopes to gather data on the comet. This includes assessing its speed and trajectory to ensure accurate predictions of its path through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The speed of 57 km/s makes 3I/Atlas the fastest of the three confirmed interstellar visitors,” said an astronomer involved in the observations. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Each new detection is a piece of the puzzle of planetary formation on a galactic scale,” the astronomer added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas joins a select group of interstellar objects, which includes <strong>1I/’Oumuamua</strong>, detected in 2017, and <strong>2I/Borisov</strong>, observed in 2019. These objects provide unique insights into the diversity of planetesimals from other star systems. Prior studies have shown that interstellar comets can have vastly different characteristics, which enhances our understanding of their formation and the conditions in their home systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Continuous monitoring of 3I/Atlas will occur as it travels through the solar system. Scientists aim to collect more data on its composition and trajectory, which may reveal new information about the nature of interstellar objects. The advent of new telescopes, such as the Observatório Vera C. Rubin, is expected to increase the frequency of interstellar object detections in the future.</p>
