      <h2>1952: Fighter Jets Chase UFOs Over DC, Mystery Endures 70 Years Later</h2>

<p>In July 1952, fighter jets were dispatched to intercept unidentified aerial phenomena over Washington, D.C. The incidents, occurring on July 26, involved pilots from the 142nd Fighter Interceptor Squadron, who reported seeing multiple unknown lights in the restricted airspace. No injuries or fatalities were reported.</p>

<p>The events of July 1952 are significant due to the heightened Cold War tensions and the unprecedented number of UFO reports across the United States. Authorities, including the Air Force, have faced ongoing pressure to explain these sightings. The incidents have since become a focal point for investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: July 26, 1952</li>
    <li>Location: Washington, D.C. area, particularly around New Castle Air Force Base</li>
    <li>Pilots Involved: Lieutenant William L. Patterson and Captain John McHugo</li>
    <li>Aircraft: F-94 jets</li>
    <li>Altitude of Engagement: 20,000 feet</li>
    <li>Speed Achieved: Nearly 600 mph</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 19, 1952, air traffic controllers observed several unidentified radar blips, which were initially dismissed as weather anomalies. However, the following weekend, radar operators tracked multiple targets exhibiting unusual maneuvers.</p>
<p>On July 26, Lieutenant Patterson and Captain McHugo were ordered to investigate these unidentified lights. Upon arrival near National Airport, Patterson visually confirmed four bright, stationary lights that did not behave like conventional aircraft. After a brief engagement, the lights vanished, leaving no visual confirmation for the pilots.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The rapid sequence of events became known as the ‘Washington Flap,’ capturing national attention,” a military spokesperson stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Despite the record number of reported encounters, 701 cases were left unresolved by the project’s termination in 1969,” noted the report on Project Blue Book.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The July 1952 sightings were part of a larger trend of UFO reports during the Cold War, when military and public interest in aerial phenomena surged. The Air Force's Project Blue Book was established to investigate these incidents, but many cases remain unresolved, contributing to ongoing speculation and intrigue.</p>
<p>Modern discussions about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) have been revitalized by the establishment of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office in 2022, reflecting a renewed commitment to understanding UAPs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAPs continue, with a significant increase in reported sightings. In 2025, over 700 UAP reports were logged, indicating that the mystery surrounding incidents like those of July 1952 persists more than 70 years later.</p>
