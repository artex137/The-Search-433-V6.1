      <h2>US Rep. Anna Paulina Luna details strange UFO experience while serving in the Air Force</h2>

<p>US Representative Anna Paulina Luna has recounted a strange UFO encounter from her time in the US Air Force, involving an “airspace incursion” that left a military pilot unsettled. Luna, who serves as a Republican representative from Florida, shared her experience on “The Joe Rogan Experience” on Wednesday, stating that the incident occurred while she was stationed at the Portland Air National Guard Base.</p>

<p>This account matters as it raises questions about transparency and credibility surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Luna, who leads a task force investigating UAPs for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has called for increased government transparency regarding these incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident involved an airspace incursion at Portland Air National Guard Base.</li>
    <li>Luna served six years as an airfield management specialist.</li>
    <li>More than 2,100 UAP sightings reported in the US in 2025.</li>
    <li>Previous year (2024) saw 1,492 UAP sightings, according to the National UFO Reporting Center.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon denies evidence of extraterrestrial life linked to unexplained sightings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During her service, Luna experienced an airspace incursion at the Portland Air National Guard Base. She spoke with F-16 pilots about the incident, but they were reluctant to discuss what they had seen. One pilot expressed concern about maintaining his flight status and indicated that the object could not be identified.</p>
<p>Luna concluded that the airspace incursion was likely a UAP. She emphasized the stigma surrounding reporting such incidents within the military, which can jeopardize personnel’s security clearances and reputations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What I can tell you is, when you have thousands upon thousands of people from around the planet throughout time that have reported something, to say those people are crazy … that’s a disinformation campaign to get people to shut up about it,” Luna said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’d like to see the federal government roll out some of the stuff we’ve been given access to because I think that information belongs in the hands of the American people,” she added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Luna's call for transparency comes amid a significant increase in UAP sightings reported across the United States. The government has faced criticism for its lack of transparency regarding UFOs, with many advocates pushing for more information to be made available to the public.</p>
<p>Last week, a Harvard physicist claimed that new images of an interstellar object could indicate it is not a natural phenomenon, further fueling discussions around the nature of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform continues to investigate UAPs, with Luna advocating for the release of more government information on the subject. Further developments are expected as the task force gathers more evidence and testimonies.</p>
