      <h2>Space agencies activate planetary defense to monitor the unpredictable path of comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense protocol to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object to visit our solar system, as it exhibits erratic behavior and significant changes in trajectory and brightness. The activation was announced on January 10, 2026, as the comet approaches its perihelion on October 30, 2025, passing close to the orbit of Jupiter.</p>

<p>This activation is crucial for testing and improving global Near-Earth Object (NEO) response systems, according to NASA. Authorities have emphasized that there is no imminent risk of collision with Earth, but the comet presents a unique opportunity for coordinated monitoring by international partners, including the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) and the Minor Planet Center at Harvard.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS astronomical survey system in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is traveling at over 210,000 km/h and will be ejected back into interstellar space in 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA has collaborated with IAWN and the European Space Agency (ESA) for monitoring efforts.</li>
    <li>A technical meeting is scheduled for November 10, 2025, to adapt tracking algorithms for the comet's trajectory.</li>
    <li>Observatories in Hawaii, Chile, and Europe will dedicate time to monitor the comet from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS system in Chile. Since then, astronomers have noted its unusual non-gravitational acceleration due to jets of gas and dust that alter its trajectory. On October 30, 2025, the comet will reach its perihelion, passing close to Jupiter. A series of workshops have been organized to standardize methodologies for tracking the comet.</p>

<p>Between November 27, 2025, and January 27, 2026, an intensive practical exercise campaign will take place, coinciding with the comet's closest approach and peak activity. This period will test the global planetary defense infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS offers a valuable opportunity to apply lessons learned from past missions and improve our response to NEOs,” said a NASA representative. “We are coordinating with international partners to ensure effective monitoring.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, both of which presented unique characteristics that expanded our understanding of celestial bodies. While ‘Oumuamua was a rocky object with no visible coma, 2I/Borisov resembled a traditional comet. The differences among these interstellar visitors highlight the diversity of objects in our galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS closely, refining tracking models and preparing for future observations. The results of the upcoming practical exercise campaign will be crucial for enhancing global planetary defense capabilities.</p>
