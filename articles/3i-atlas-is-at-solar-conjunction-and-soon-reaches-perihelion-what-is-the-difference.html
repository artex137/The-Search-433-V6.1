      <h2>3I/ATLAS is at solar conjunction and soon reaches perihelion</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reached solar conjunction and is expected to reach perihelion on October 29-30, 2023. The comet is currently traveling at a speed of 210,000 km/hour, having already passed Mars and moving behind the Sun, making it temporarily invisible from Earth.</p>

<p>This event matters to scientists who are preparing to observe the comet once it becomes visible again. 3I/ATLAS is anticipated to exit the solar system in the coming months, but it will not be visible to the naked eye until December 2025. The comet's trajectory and characteristics have sparked interest in the scientific community, with discussions about its potential origins and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached solar conjunction on October 22, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach perihelion on October 29-30, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at a speed of 210,000 km/hour.</li>
    <li>It will be approximately 270 million kilometres away from Earth at its nearest point.</li>
    <li>Only telescopes with a minimum aperture of 8 inches can locate the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has traveled through the solar system and passed Mars. On October 22, 2023, it reached solar conjunction, moving behind the Sun and becoming invisible to observers on Earth. The comet is projected to reach perihelion on October 29-30, 2023, marking its closest approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>After perihelion, 3I/ATLAS will continue its trajectory, moving away from the Sun and will not become visible again until December 2025. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicates that it is not bound by the Sun's gravity and will eventually exit the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The extreme brightness is preventing us from seeing 3I/ATLAS from Earth,” experts have stated regarding the comet's current visibility.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being an interstellar comet, which has raised questions about its origins and composition. Its unique characteristics, including the absence of a cometary tail for an extended period, have intrigued scientists. The comet's trajectory and its eventual exit from the solar system are significant for ongoing research in astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. Preparations are underway to observe the comet once it re-emerges from behind the Sun in late 2025.</p>
