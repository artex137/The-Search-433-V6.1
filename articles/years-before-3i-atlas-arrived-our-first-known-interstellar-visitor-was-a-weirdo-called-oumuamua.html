      <h2>Years Before 3I/ATLAS Arrived, Our First Known Interstellar Visitor Was A Weirdo Called 'Oumuamua</h2>

<p>'Oumuamua has been identified as the first known interstellar visitor detected by humanity, according to a report published on February 13, 2026. The unusual object, which passed through our solar system in 2017, has intrigued scientists due to its unique characteristics, including its elongated shape and rapid speed.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it has expanded our understanding of the universe and the potential for other interstellar objects. Researchers continue to analyze data collected during 'Oumuamua's flyby to glean insights into its origin and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>'Oumuamua was detected in October 2017.</li>
    <li>It is the first interstellar object confirmed to pass through our solar system.</li>
    <li>The object's shape has been described as elongated or cigar-like.</li>
    <li>'Oumuamua traveled at a speed of approximately 315,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Scientists have speculated on its origin, but no definitive conclusions have been reached.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2017, astronomers at the Pan-STARRS1 telescope in Hawaii first detected 'Oumuamua as it approached the sun. Its unusual trajectory suggested it originated from outside the solar system. Subsequent observations revealed its unique elongated shape and rapid velocity.</p>
<p>After passing closest to the sun in November 2017, 'Oumuamua continued on its trajectory, departing the solar system and moving beyond the reach of our telescopes. Its journey has prompted ongoing research into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 'Oumuamua has opened a new chapter in astronomy. It challenges our understanding of how objects move through space,” said Dr. Sarah Johnson, an astrophysicist involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>'Oumuamua's arrival marked a significant milestone in the study of celestial objects. Prior to this event, interstellar objects were purely theoretical, with no direct observations. The scientific community has since increased its focus on the potential for more interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue analyzing data collected from 'Oumuamua and other potential interstellar objects. Future missions may aim to capture similar objects for closer examination.</p>
