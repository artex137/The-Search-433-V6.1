      <h2>The countdown has begun: in a few days, the truth about 3I/ATLAS will be revealed</h2>

<p>Earth is set to gain a rare view of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it aligns with the Sun and planet on 22 January 2026. This event will provide astronomers a unique opportunity to study the object, which was discovered in July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this astronomical event.</p>

<p>The alignment of 3I/ATLAS with the Sun and Earth, referred to as near opposition, will allow scientists to observe its brightness and gather data on its composition. This event is significant as it could help determine whether 3I/ATLAS is a typical icy comet or something more unusual. NASA and several observatories are preparing to monitor the object closely during this period.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The object will reach near opposition with the Sun and Earth on 22 January 2026.</li>
    <li>It has a hyperbolic path, meaning it will not return after this pass.</li>
    <li>During its peak brightness, 3I/ATLAS is expected to be at magnitude 13.</li>
    <li>NASA’s SPHEREx mission observed the comet in December 2025, noting it had become fully active.</li>
    <li>It is expected to fade and depart into deep space within a few months after its peak.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. Following its discovery, it was identified as the third known interstellar object passing through our solar system. The comet reached perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, in late October 2025. Observations from December 2025 indicated that 3I/ATLAS had become a fully active comet, showing signs of water, carbon dioxide, and organic molecules.</p>

<p>The near opposition alignment on 22 January 2026 will allow astronomers to measure brightness and gather information about the object's dust and structure. This event is anticipated to last for about a week.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The opposition-surge campaign is a tie breaker of sorts,” said Mauro Barbieri, one of the researchers involved in the study. “If the brightness spike and its color follow patterns seen in other comets, that will strengthen the case for a natural icy body.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects have been observed, but 3I/ATLAS is unique due to its active status as a comet. Scientists have noted an unusual “anti tail” and jets of material, leading to discussions about its classification. While some researchers, like Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, suggest the possibility of alien technology, NASA classifies it as a comet with typical characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its peak alignment, professional observatories will continue to monitor its behavior. The results from this observation period will provide insight into the composition of interstellar objects and their role in the formation of planets. The findings will likely be published in scientific journals following the alignment.</p>
