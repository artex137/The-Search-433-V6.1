      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to pass Earth on 19 December</h2>

<p>Astronomers have been closely monitoring interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach scheduled for 19 December 2025. As of 14 December 2025, the comet was approximately 270.5 million kilometres away. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the unique features observed in 3I/ATLAS, which challenge existing theories about comet behaviour in interstellar space. Researchers confirm that the flyby poses no risk to Earth, but ongoing observations are crucial as the comet approaches.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: 19 December 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 268.9 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Last observation date: 13 December 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Rayong, Thailand</li>
    <li>Telescope used: 0.26 metre telescope</li>
    <li>Delay in image transmission: approximately 15 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 13 December 2025, astronomer Teerasak Thaluang captured the latest images of comet 3I/ATLAS using a telescope in Rayong, Thailand. The images revealed an unusual anti tail feature, which is seldom seen in comets. This feature has persisted since it first appeared in a Hubble image in July 2025, remaining visible through subsequent observations.</p>

<p>On 19 November 2025, NASA held a press conference that did not address the mystery surrounding the comet's behaviour. Since then, scientists have proposed new theories to explain the unusual observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite the change in the comet’s trajectory, the anti tail has remained visible, suggesting that a physical process is responsible,” said Eric Keto, co-author of two peer-reviewed papers on the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its unusual anti tail, which contradicts typical comet behaviour where tails extend away from the Sun. Researchers have noted that anti tails can appear when Earth crosses a comet's orbital plane, but this explanation does not apply in this case. The persistence of the anti tail since July challenges existing cometary models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the object approaches its closest point to Earth, scientists are preparing for further analysis, particularly with upcoming observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, which may provide additional insights into the comet's behaviour.</p>
