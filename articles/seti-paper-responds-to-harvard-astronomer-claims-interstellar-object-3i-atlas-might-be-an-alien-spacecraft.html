      <h2>SETI Paper Responds To Harvard Astronomer Claims Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Might Be An Alien Spacecraft</h2>

<p>A paper from the SETI Institute has addressed claims regarding interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025. The object is currently on an escape trajectory through the Solar System, and has generated speculation about its nature as a potential alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>This discussion has arisen following comments from Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be an interstellar probe sent by an intelligent species. SETI scientist AKM Eahsanul Haque has published a paper countering this assertion, arguing that 3I/ATLAS is likely a natural object rather than an artificial one. The debate highlights the need for clarity in understanding the origins of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of detection:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Detection agency:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Object designation:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar visitors:</strong> ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Orbital characteristics:</strong> Retrograde orbit with a 0.2% chance of alignment coincidence</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Likelihood of close encounters:</strong> About 0.005% for Venus, Mars, and Jupiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by ATLAS on July 1, 2025. Following the detection, astronomers began to observe the object more closely. Avi Loeb proposed the idea that it could be an alien spacecraft, suggesting a possible threat to Earth. In response, AKM Eahsanul Haque published a paper countering this claim, providing evidence that supports the natural origin of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The retrograde orbital plane of 3I/ATLAS is quite near to the ecliptic, with a 0.2% likelihood that this alignment is not just a coincidence,” said AKM Eahsanul Haque.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The hyperbolic trajectory... and the high speed of about 58 kilometers per second... are both consistent with gravitational ejection from a distant star system,” Haque added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The fact that 3I/ATLAS did not display such acceleration is a strong argument against the idea of artificial propulsion,” Haque explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS follows similar debates about previous interstellar objects such as ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. While these objects prompted speculation about extraterrestrial life, scientific consensus generally leans towards natural explanations for their origins. The ongoing discourse reflects the broader fascination with the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As research continues, scientists will further analyze 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory. Haque's paper has not yet been peer-reviewed, and the scientific community is likely to await additional observations and data to clarify the nature of this interstellar object.</p>
