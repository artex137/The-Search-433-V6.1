      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: what is known about the comet's closest approach to Earth on December 19th and why everyone is on alert</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth at approximately 270 million kilometers on December 19, 2025, according to astronomers. The comet is expected to pass by Earth in the early morning hours, and there are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This approach is significant because it presents a rare opportunity for scientists to study an interstellar object. Authorities, including various scientific institutions, are monitoring the comet's trajectory and reassuring the public that there is no risk of collision with Earth. Alarmist theories circulating on social media have prompted experts to clarify the comet's nature and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 270 million kilometers (1.8 astronomical units)</li>
    <li>Detected by: automated sky-scanning program in July 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest point to the Sun): end of October 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: hundreds of thousands of kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Observational requirements: medium or large telescopes needed for visibility</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, an automated sky-scanning program detected 3I/ATLAS. Following this discovery, astronomers calculated its orbit and confirmed it as an interstellar object. The perihelion occurred at the end of October 2025, marking its closest approach to the Sun. As the comet moves away from the Sun, it will align with Earth for its closest approach on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>Throughout this period, scientists have been collecting data using space telescopes and probes to analyze the comet's coma and tail, as well as its composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no physical scenario in which this passage would result in an impact,” said a representative from a leading astronomical institution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Official messages emphasize that alarms about ‘the end of the world’ or ‘imminent impact’ are misinformation,” said another expert.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System, following Oumuamua and another unnamed object. Its classification as a comet, with an icy nucleus and a tail formed by solar wind, aligns with the characteristics of traditional comets.</p>

<p>The comet's trajectory has led to speculation and alarmist theories on social media, but astronomers have consistently stated that the object behaves like a typical comet, with no evidence of artificial signals or controlled technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As December 19 approaches, scientific institutions will continue to refine their observations and data collection. They encourage the public to follow observatory broadcasts and simulations for real-time updates on the comet's passage.</p>
