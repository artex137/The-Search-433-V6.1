      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS caught on camera in new images from Hubble Space Telescope and JUICE Jupiter probe</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been captured in new images by the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft in November 2023. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2023, by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides scientists with insights into the chemistry and dynamics of celestial bodies from other stars. The European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA have coordinated efforts to study the comet as it travels through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>JUICE spacecraft observed the comet on November 2, 2023, from approximately 41 million miles (66 million kilometers) away.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope conducted observations on November 30, 2023, when the comet was about 178 million miles (286 million kilometers) from Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will not come closer than 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) to Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet was observed by JUICE on November 2, capturing its activity and composition shortly after its closest approach to the sun on October 30. The Hubble Space Telescope tracked 3I/ATLAS on November 30, revealing details about its structure and activity.</p>

<p>During these observations, JUICE used its Navigation Camera (NavCam) to send back preliminary images of the comet, revealing its nucleus and a glowing coma. The Hubble's observations confirmed the comet's continued activity, showing a bright core surrounded by dust.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our JUICE team couldn't wait that long,” ESA stated regarding the eagerness to obtain early data from the spacecraft.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. “The objects in our solar system will be just fine.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed in our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The observations of 3I/ATLAS have revealed unusual chemistry in its dust, including a higher-than-normal carbon-dioxide-to-water ratio and gas rich in nickel. These findings suggest that the comet may have formed under conditions different from those in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further data from JUICE, expected to arrive on Earth in February 2026, will provide deeper insights into the comet's composition and activity as it travels through the solar system.</p>
