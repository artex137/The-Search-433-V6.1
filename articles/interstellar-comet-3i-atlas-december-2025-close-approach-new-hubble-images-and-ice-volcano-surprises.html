      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: December 2025 Close Approach, New Hubble Images and ‘Ice Volcano’ Surprises</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), has drawn significant attention as it nears its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025. Recent observations and images from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) reveal that this interstellar visitor is more active than previously anticipated, showing signs of vigorous activity and unique features.</p>

<p>This comet, the third confirmed interstellar object, is on a hyperbolic orbit that originates from interstellar space. Its approach offers a valuable opportunity for scientists and amateur astronomers to study a comet that has traveled across the galaxy. NASA has released new images from the Hubble Space Telescope, showcasing the comet’s bright core and surrounding coma of dust and gas.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (170 million miles / 270 million km).</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> 30 October 2025, at about 1.4 AU (130 million miles / 210 million km).</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Estimated at magnitude ~10–11, not visible to the naked eye but detectable with telescopes.</li>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Estimated between 3 to 14 billion years, possibly older than the Solar System.</li>
    <li><strong>Notable features:</strong> Evidence of cryovolcano activity, with jets of gas and dust erupting from its surface.</li>
    <li><strong>First discovered:</strong> 1 July 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers first reported 3I/ATLAS, identifying it as an interstellar object on a hyperbolic trajectory. Subsequent observations confirmed its path and characteristics. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet on 30 November 2025, showing its bright core and coma. The ESA's Juice spacecraft also observed the comet in November 2025, although detailed data will not be available until February 2026.</p>

<p>By 19 December 2025, the comet is expected to be about 170 million miles from Earth, providing an opportunity for observations from Earth-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Scientists have been surprised by how active 3I/ATLAS appears so soon after its closest approach to the Sun,” NASA stated in their announcement regarding the recent observations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The Sun’s heat is likely triggering sublimation of solid carbon dioxide in the comet’s outer layers,” researchers noted, explaining the observed cryovolcano activity.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique origins and characteristics have drawn extensive interest from the scientific community, particularly regarding its potential age and the processes occurring on its surface.</p>

<p>Prior to this, interstellar objects have provided insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. 3I/ATLAS presents a rare opportunity to study an object that may have formed before the Solar System itself.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it departs the solar system, with additional images expected in the coming months. The findings from ESA’s Juice spacecraft will be released in February 2026, offering further insights into this interstellar visitor.</p>
