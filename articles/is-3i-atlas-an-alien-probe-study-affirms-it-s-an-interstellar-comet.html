      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS an alien probe? Study affirms it's an interstellar comet</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS is not an extraterrestrial spacecraft, dispelling conspiracy theories about its origins. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, coming within approximately 170 million miles of the planet.</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it addresses public concerns over the possibility of alien technology. A team of scientists, using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, observed 3I/ATLAS on the day of its closest approach and found no signs of radio emissions that would indicate it is anything but a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance during closest approach: about 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>Speed at discovery: 137,000 mph, according to NASA.</li>
    <li>Estimated size: between 1,400 feet and 3½ miles in diameter.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted by the Breakthrough Listen team.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025, when it was confirmed as the third known object from interstellar space to enter our solar system. On December 19, 2025, astronomers used the Green Bank Telescope to observe the comet during its closest approach to Earth. The team reported no detectable radio signals, leading them to conclude that the comet is a natural object.</p>

<p>In November 2025, NASA released a series of images revealing new characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. The agency has consistently maintained that the comet poses no threat to Earth and is not alien in nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said Sean Duffy, then-Acting Administrator of NASA, in a social media exchange.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” stated Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, at a news conference in November 2025.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS has sparked numerous conspiracy theories, particularly one proposed by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who suggested it could be an alien spaceship. However, Loeb has acknowledged that the object is "most likely a comet of natural origin," despite not ruling out extraterrestrial technology entirely.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The astronomers involved in the study plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects to further understand their nature and origins. The findings from this research have yet to undergo peer review.</p>
