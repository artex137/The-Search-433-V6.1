      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Doomsday Rumours</h2>
<p>The announcement of comet 3I/ATLAS has prompted a wave of doomsday rumours and conspiracy theories about alien invasions, particularly on social media platforms like TikTok and X (Twitter). This phenomenon has occurred in response to the comet's recent detection, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This situation highlights the psychological tendency of humans to fill gaps in understanding with dramatic narratives. Authorities and scientists are now focusing on improving science communication to counteract the spread of misinformation related to space events.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected recently, though the exact date is not disclosed.</li>
<li>Social media platforms have played a significant role in the spread of rumours.</li>
<li>Psychologists attribute this behaviour to cognitive biases such as the illusory truth effect.</li>
<li>Historical examples include Halley’s Comet in 1910 and the Nibiru conspiracy in the 1990s.</li>
<li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected, leading to immediate speculation and rumours about alien invasions. As news spread, social media users began sharing theories that suggested NASA was hiding information. This pattern of behaviour has been observed with other celestial events, where uncertainty breeds imagination.</p>

<p>In previous decades, similar instances have occurred, such as the panic surrounding Halley’s Comet and the Nibiru conspiracy theory, both of which generated significant public concern despite lacking scientific basis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Clear, timely explanations about objects like 3I/ATLAS can reduce misinformation,” experts have said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every comet is a chance to learn more about the universe, not to panic about alien invasions,” a science communication advocate stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, unusual celestial events have often triggered public fears and conspiracy theories. The detection of ʻOumuamua in 2017 sparked similar alien ship theories online. These events reveal a long-standing pattern where each new astronomical discovery becomes a canvas for human fears and speculation.</p>

<p>Mistrust in institutions like NASA can exacerbate these beliefs, especially among groups that feel disconnected from mainstream science. When official communication is filled with jargon, it can lead to perceptions of evasion, further fuelling suspicions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts emphasize the need for improved science communication strategies to address the misinformation surrounding comet 3I/ATLAS. Future announcements are expected to focus on clear explanations about the comet's trajectory and the absence of any potential threat.</p>
