      <h2>3I/ATLAS moving faster than human-made spacecraft</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is confirmed to reach Jupiter in March 2026, significantly earlier than the ESA's Juice spacecraft, which will arrive in July 2031. This discovery highlights the high velocities of interstellar objects, which are not bound by the Sun’s gravity.</p>

<p>This information is crucial as it emphasizes the unique nature of interstellar comets and the data collection efforts by the Juice spacecraft. The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that Juice will observe 3I/ATLAS, allowing for detailed scientific analysis of this rare visitor from outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>Juice will arrive at Jupiter in July 2031.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, at 202.9 million kilometres from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Juice made its closest approach to 3I/ATLAS on November 4, 2025, at a distance of approximately 66 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Data from Juice's scientific instruments will be released on February 18 and 20, 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at speeds exceeding 210,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope. NASA confirmed the object's interstellar origin. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025. Juice observed 3I/ATLAS for the first time on November 2, 2025, and made its closest approach on November 4, 2025.</p>
<p>The data collected by Juice will be transmitted to Earth, with partial data expected to arrive in February 2026, just before the comet's closest point to Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project, stated, “This data will arrive a month before the comet reaches its closest point to Jupiter on March 16, 2026.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object detected, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates that it will not return to the solar system after its passage.</p>
<p>ESA has noted that interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS carry important clues about other star systems, enhancing our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA will continue to analyze data from Juice, with a focus on the findings from the various scientific instruments scheduled for release in February 2026. No threats to Earth from 3I/ATLAS have been identified, as it will pass at a safe distance.</p>
