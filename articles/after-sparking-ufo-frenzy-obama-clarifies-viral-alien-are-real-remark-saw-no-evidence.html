      <h2>Former President Obama Clarifies Alien Comments Amid Viral Reaction</h2>

<p>Former US President Barack Obama has clarified his comments regarding extraterrestrial life after they went viral on social media. During a podcast with political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen, released over the weekend, Obama stated, “They’re real. But I haven’t seen them.” He emphasized that he has seen no evidence that aliens have contacted Earth.</p>

<p>Obama's remarks have prompted discussions about UFOs and government transparency. In response to the online frenzy, he took to Instagram to provide a detailed clarification, stating that while the universe may statistically harbor life, he has not encountered evidence of alien visitations during his presidency.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Podcast released: Weekend prior to October 2023</li>
    <li>Interview with: Brian Tyler Cohen</li>
    <li>Clarification posted on: Instagram</li>
    <li>Area 51 size: 8,000 square miles (20,700 square kilometres)</li>
    <li>Area 51 acknowledged by CIA: 2013</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Obama's comments about aliens were made during a podcast where he responded to a question about the existence of extraterrestrial life. His statement went viral shortly after the podcast was published. Following the public reaction, Obama issued a clarification on Instagram to elaborate on his initial remarks.</p>

<p>In his clarification, Obama explained that while the vastness of the universe suggests a possibility of life, he has not found any evidence of alien contact during his time in office.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote> 

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51, located in the Nevada desert, has been a focal point for conspiracy theories related to UFOs and alien life. The CIA officially acknowledged the facility's existence in 2013, although it did not confirm any allegations of extraterrestrial activity. The site has historically been associated with the testing of advanced military aircraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are no current investigations or official actions related to Obama's comments. However, discussions about government transparency and UFOs may continue to gain traction in public discourse.</p>
