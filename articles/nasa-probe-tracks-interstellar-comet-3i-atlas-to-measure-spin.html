      <h2>NASA Probe Tracks Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to Measure Spin</h2>

<p>NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has tracked interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels beyond our solar system during a dedicated observation period from January 15 to January 22. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insights into the comet’s activity and rotation, which could reveal important information about its material loss rate and core speed. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have compiled the observation data into a 28-hour video, enhancing understanding of this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Observation Dates:</strong> January 15-22</li>
    <li><strong>Video Duration:</strong> 28 hours of observations</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness Measurement:</strong> Approximately 11.5 in apparent magnitude</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Interruption:</strong> TESS entered “safe mode” due to solar panel issues</li>
    <li>Prior detection of comet 3I/ATLAS occurred before its formal discovery</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's TESS began observing comet 3I/ATLAS on January 15. The comet was tracked until January 22, during which a 28-hour video was created. The observations were interrupted when TESS entered a “safe mode” on January 18 due to issues with its solar panels.</p>

<p>Despite the interruption, the collected data allows scientists to analyze the comet’s behavior and rotation. TESS had previously detected another comet in May 2025 two months before 3I/ATLAS was officially identified, aiding in isolating this interstellar object from background noise.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“TESS’s capabilities allowed astronomers to detect comet 3I/ATLAS even prior to its formal discovery,” said Daniel Muthukrishna from MIT. “The data opens avenues for astronomers to uncover patterns of brightness in the comet’s activity.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ability to observe and analyze comets like 3I/ATLAS is part of NASA’s ongoing commitment to monitoring astronomical phenomena. These observations enhance our understanding of the universe and its elusive visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The findings from TESS’s January observations are publicly available through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, allowing astronomers to further investigate the comet’s characteristics and behavior.</p>
