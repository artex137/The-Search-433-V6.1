      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Spurious reports claim that an alien spaceship might have entered our solar system</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/ATLAS, discovered this summer, has sparked speculation about its potential as an alien spaceship. The comet is an interstellar visitor from another solar system and is only the third of its kind to be observed. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this phenomenon.</p>

<p>The excitement surrounding 3I/ATLAS stems from its unusual characteristics, which have led certain individuals to suggest that it may be artificial. Authorities in the scientific community continue to investigate the comet's properties while addressing the misinformation circulating in media reports.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in summer 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>Professor Avi Loeb from Harvard University has made claims about the comet's behavior.</li>
    <li>Mark Norris, a senior lecturer in astronomy at the University of Lancashire, has publicly refuted claims of the comet being artificial.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In summer 2023, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS, generating excitement about its interstellar origins. As scientists tracked its journey, some, including Professor Loeb, suggested that its movement indicated artificial origin. These claims led to widespread media coverage, which has been met with skepticism from other members of the scientific community.</p>

<p>Mark Norris publicly countered the claims, stating the comet is a natural object composed of carbon dioxide and water ices. He emphasized that its orbit is as expected and that it poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite claims that 3I/ATLAS may be an alien spaceship, a growing body of observations reveals that it is a natural comet, not a probe from a distant corner of the Milky Way,” said Mark Norris.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Just to be clear - given recent drivel on line - Comet 3I/ATLAS is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff,” Norris added on X, formerly known as Twitter.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of ʻOumuamua in 2017, which also generated speculation about extraterrestrial life. The scientific community has since emphasized the importance of rigorous observation and evidence in evaluating such claims.</p>

<p>The current discourse reflects ongoing tensions between scientific inquiry and sensational media reporting, particularly in the realm of astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it traverses the solar system. Observations and studies will aim to clarify its composition and behavior, while addressing public misconceptions regarding its origins.</p>
