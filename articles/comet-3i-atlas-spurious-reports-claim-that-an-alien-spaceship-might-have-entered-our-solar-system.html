      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Spurious reports claim that an alien spaceship might have entered our solar system</h2>

<p>Reports have emerged claiming that Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet discovered this summer, may be an alien spaceship. The comet, which is only the third of its kind to visit our solar system, has generated excitement among scientists due to its unique characteristics.</p>

<p>The speculation surrounding Comet 3I/ATLAS has prompted responses from the scientific community. Experts have emphasized that the comet is a natural object and not an artificial spacecraft. Authorities, including astronomers, continue to study the comet to better understand its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in summer 2023</li>
    <li>Only the third interstellar comet observed</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard University professor, has suggested it may be artificial</li>
    <li>Mark Norris, a senior lecturer in astronomy, has countered claims of alien origins</li>
    <li>Comet composed of carbon dioxide, water ices, and other materials</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in summer 2023, leading to excitement within the scientific community about its interstellar origins. The comet's unusual characteristics have sparked speculation about its nature, with some claiming it could be a spacecraft. However, experts have been quick to clarify the comet's natural composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite claims that 3I/ATLAS may be an alien spaceship, a growing body of observations reveals that it is a natural comet, not a probe from a distant corner of the Milky Way,” said Mark Norris, senior lecturer in astronomy at the University of Lancashire.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Just to be clear - given recent drivel online - Comet 3I/ATLAS is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff,” Norris added on X, formerly known as Twitter.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of ʻOumuamua in 2017, the first interstellar object detected in our solar system. Avi Loeb has made similar claims regarding other unidentified objects in the past, contributing to ongoing debates about the nature of interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, aiming to gather more data that will clarify its characteristics and origins.</p>
