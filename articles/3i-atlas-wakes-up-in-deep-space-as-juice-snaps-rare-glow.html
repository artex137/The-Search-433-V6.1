      <h2>3I/ATLAS 'Wakes Up' in Deep Space as JUICE Snaps Rare Glow</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency's (ESA) JUICE spacecraft has captured dramatic signs of activity from comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a glowing halo and possible tails in deep space on 2 November 2025. This interstellar object, discovered by the ATLAS survey on 1 July 2025, is the third known interstellar object to enter our Solar System.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar comet shortly after its perihelion, when such objects typically exhibit peak activity. Scientists are eager to analyze the data collected by JUICE's onboard instruments, which will be delivered in February 2026, to gain insights into the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of observation:</strong> 2 November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from JUICE:</strong> Approximately 66 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Expected data delivery:</strong> 18 and 20 February 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments used:</strong> JUICE's Navigation Camera (NavCam)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey. Following its discovery, astronomers tracked the comet as it moved toward the Sun. It was observed by Earth-based telescopes and Mars orbiters, including ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express, between early October and mid-November 2025. On 2 November 2025, JUICE captured its first images of the comet, revealing a glowing coma and evidence of outgassing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observation campaign was unexpected for everybody,” said a representative from ESA, highlighting the fortunate timing of JUICE's observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this observation, 3I/ATLAS exhibited unusual characteristics compared to typical Solar System comets. Spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope indicated a coma dominated by carbon dioxide, which contrasts with the water ice typically found in other comets. Additionally, polarimetric studies suggested that 3I/ATLAS may have a surface enriched in water ice or other primitive ices.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are awaiting the full dataset from JUICE's instruments, which will provide a comprehensive analysis of the comet's coma and tails, as well as insights into its nucleus. This data could enhance understanding of interstellar comets and the planetary systems from which they originate.</p>
