      <h2>New Images Reveal Ice Volcanoes on Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>New high-resolution images from the Joan Oró Telescope in Spain have shown that comet 3I/ATLAS is actively erupting, revealing a surface covered in what scientists have termed "ice volcanoes" or cryovolcanoes. The images were captured as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth, known as perihelion, which will occur in December 2023.</p>

<p>This discovery has sparked significant interest within the scientific community. Researchers are now racing to gather data on the comet, which is moving at a speed of 137,000 miles per hour (approximately 220,000 kilometers per hour) and will soon slingshot around the sun before disappearing from view. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the comet's nature and raise questions about its geological activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently approaching its perihelion in December 2023.</li>
    <li>Images captured by the Joan Oró Telescope in Spain show active cryovolcanoes.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at 137,000 mph (approximately 220,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>The study is led by researcher Josep Trigo-Rodríguez.</li>
    <li>This phenomenon has generated debate among astronomers regarding its implications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed in 2019 as a seemingly quiet interstellar object. Recent images taken in late 2023 have revealed unexpected cryovolcanic activity, prompting researchers to reassess their understanding of the comet's composition and behavior.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the sun in December 2023, after which it will continue its journey out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We were all surprised,” Trigo-Rodríguez said. “Being a comet formed in a remote planetary system, it is remarkable that [it resembles] bodies belonging to our planetary system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations of 3I/ATLAS indicated it was a simple, ancient comet. The new findings suggest that the object may not be as inactive as previously thought. Scientists are now exploring whether the cryovolcanic activity could indicate some form of internal machinery or a more complex geological process.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its perihelion and gather as much data as possible before it exits the solar system. The ongoing exploration of this comet may yield valuable insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
