      <h2>'Aliens Among Us': Top Ex-Officials Lift Lid on Decades of UFO Secrecy</h2>

<p>In a new documentary and podcast discussion, former U.S. officials have claimed that the U.S. government has recovered unexplained craft and studied non-human technology, while keeping even presidents uninformed. The documentary, titled 'The Age of Disclosure', was produced by Dan Farah and discussed on The Chris Cuomo Project podcast.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it raises questions about government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Both Cuomo and Farah have highlighted the need for public discourse on the topic, arguing that decades of secrecy have obscured vital information about aerial technologies and potential threats to national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: 'The Age of Disclosure'</li>
    <li>Produced by: Dan Farah</li>
    <li>Podcast: The Chris Cuomo Project</li>
    <li>Claims involve recovery of non-human technology and craft</li>
    <li>Concerns raised about UAP near nuclear weapons sites</li>
    <li>Officials reportedly involved include the U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Adviser</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discussion began with Cuomo challenging viewers on the existence of answers regarding aerial phenomena. Farah detailed claims that the U.S. has been studying non-human technology for decades, with programmes tracing back to Roswell and earlier, during the Second World War. The documentary features testimonies from nearly three dozen current federal officials.</p>

<p>Farah stated that officials have expressed concerns about unknown objects entering restricted airspace over nuclear facilities, linking the phenomenon to potential threats posed by technological advancements. He emphasized that the topic has been stigmatized, which has hindered open discussions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We do not have any aircraft that can do that,” Farah said, referring to the capabilities of the described objects.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“To make jokes about that scenario is just as stupid as making jokes about terrorist threats to commercial airlines,” Farah added, stressing the seriousness of the issue.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Cuomo remarked, “This does not have to mean little green men. It is about transparency in a government that is supposed to be by the people and for the people.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims made in the documentary align with a growing trend of former officials speaking out about UAPs and the need for transparency from the government. The long history of secrecy surrounding UFOs has led to widespread public speculation and concern about national security.</p>

<p>Recent discussions have indicated that even a small number of UAP encounters could represent significant intelligence failures for the United States government.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As public interest in UAPs continues to rise, there may be increased pressure on government officials to disclose information. Cuomo suggested that the president may soon be compelled to address these issues publicly.</p>
