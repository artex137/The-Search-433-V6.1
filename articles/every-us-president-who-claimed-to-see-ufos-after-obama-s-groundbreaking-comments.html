Obama has stated that he believes in the existence of alien life, mentioning that “they’re real, but I haven’t seen them.”</p>

<p>This ongoing discussion highlights the interest in UFO phenomena and the implications for national security and public curiosity. Authorities continue to investigate UFO sightings, with a focus on gathering credible information and addressing public concern regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>In 1969, Jimmy Carter reported seeing a UFO while in Georgia, providing a detailed account of the sighting to the public.</p>

<p>During the 1990s, President Bill Clinton sought information about UFOs but reported he was never briefed on any alien encounters.</p>

<p>Most recently, in 2023, former President Barack Obama confirmed his belief in alien life during an interview, reigniting discussions about UFOs among the public and officials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them,” said Barack Obama during the No Lie podcast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” Obama added while discussing Area 51.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The UFO went from a normal cruise speed to a fantastic speed instantly,” recalled Reagan's pilot Bill Paynter about the sighting during Reagan's presidency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There were about twenty of us standing outside... a kind of green light appeared in the western sky,” said Jimmy Carter, describing his UFO sighting.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in UFOs among US Presidents has varied over the decades, with notable incidents prompting official investigations and public speculation. The increase in reported sightings during Truman's presidency set a precedent for future inquiries. Each subsequent President has approached the topic with varying degrees of curiosity and skepticism.</p>

<p>These discussions have often intersected with broader issues of national security, as unidentified aerial phenomena raise questions about airspace safety and potential military implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UFO sightings continue as authorities seek to gather more information and assess the implications for public safety and national security. The ongoing dialogue among former and current officials suggests a commitment to transparency regarding aerial phenomena.</p>
