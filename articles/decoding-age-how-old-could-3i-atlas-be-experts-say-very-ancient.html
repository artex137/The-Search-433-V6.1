      <h2>‘Decoding age’: How old could 3I/ATLAS be? Experts say 'very ancient’</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor, has raised questions about its age, with experts suggesting it could be exceptionally ancient, possibly between 8 and 12 billion years old. This comet was identified as the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed, having originated from another star long before entering our Solar System.</p>

<p>Understanding the age of 3I/ATLAS is significant for astronomers as it offers insights into the formation of planetary systems. The comet's study could reveal information about the early conditions of the Milky Way and the processes that govern the evolution of celestial bodies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected various elements in the comet, including H₂O, CO₂, CO, and OCS, indicating its long journey through space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor.</li>
    <li>Most interstellar comets are believed to be older than <strong>4.5 billion years</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may trace back to the Milky Way’s thick disk, which formed <strong>10–12 billion years ago</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet has an orbital eccentricity far above 1, indicating it was expelled from its original system.</li>
    <li>The JWST has detected H₂O, CO₂, CO, and OCS in 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Experts believe 3I/ATLAS is likely older than the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS originated from another star system billions of years ago. Astronomers have identified it as an interstellar object, indicating it was expelled at high speed during the chaotic epochs of planetary formation. The comet has traveled through the Milky Way for an extended period, and its surface has not been significantly altered by heat from a star.</p>

<p>Recent observations suggest that 3I/ATLAS has not been warmed by a star for a long time, indicating a long, frozen journey through space. The dark, processed surface of the comet bears signs of extensive cosmic-ray exposure, reinforcing its classification as a "Galactic fossil."</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is likely older than the Solar System, with estimates suggesting an age of 8–12 billion years, depending on its original system,” said an astronomer associated with the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS provide valuable information about the early universe and the formation of planetary systems. This comet's study contributes to a growing understanding of the chemical processes that occur in space over billions of years. Previous interstellar objects have similarly challenged existing models of solar system formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS using advanced telescopes to gather more data about its composition and origin. This ongoing research may reveal further insights into the early history of the Milky Way and the characteristics of ancient celestial bodies.</p>
