      <h2>NASA spacecraft reveal interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS brightened dramatically behind the Sun</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has brightened significantly as it nears perihelion, the point in its orbit closest to the Sun, which occurred on Thursday, October 29. The comet has temporarily slipped out of sight, obscured by the Sun's glare, but researchers and amateur astronomers continue to track its journey.</p>

<p>This brightening is significant as it provides valuable data about the comet's composition and behavior. Authorities from various space agencies, including NASA and NOAA, are utilizing multiple spacecraft to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it completes its orbit. Observations indicate that the comet's brightness has increased, and it exhibits distinctive characteristics typical of comets nearing the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Brightness peaked at around magnitude 9, visible under optimal conditions.</li>
    <li>Discovered in July 2023, it is only the third interstellar comet recorded.</li>
    <li>Current speed is over 209,000 km/h (130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>Estimated size is approximately 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across.</li>
    <li>Expected to reappear by early December 2023, visible to ground-based telescopes.</li>
    <li>Potential observations by spacecraft orbiting Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 18, Thai amateur astronomer Worachate Boonplod detected 3I/ATLAS using images from the GOES-19 satellite. This satellite is part of NOAA's weather-monitoring fleet and captured the comet's movement.</p>

<p>From October 18 to October 24, Boonplod noted that the comet's brightness was similar to nearby stars, around magnitude 11. NASA's PUNCH mission and the joint NASA–ESA SOHO observatory monitored the comet until October 26.</p>

<p>On October 28, two researchers published a paper on arXiv detailing the comet's sharp brightening before perihelion, confirming its distinct blue appearance due to gas emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s moving from left to right across the field,” Boonplod noted in the Comets Mailing List, referring to the comet's trajectory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This visitor is simply a natural object — a rocky remnant from a distant galaxy,” scientists stated regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS amid speculation about its origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar comet recorded, following 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov. Its remarkable speed suggests it has traveled through the galaxy for billions of years, offering insights into the formation of solar systems.</p>

<p>Prior research indicates that comets like 3I/ATLAS may provide clues about the early solar system and the materials that formed planets. The study of such comets is crucial for understanding the history of our galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its next visibility phase in early December 2023. Observations from spacecraft may also occur as it passes by Jupiter in March 2026, further enhancing our understanding of this ancient celestial traveler.</p>
