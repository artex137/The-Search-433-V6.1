      <h2>NASA Reports on Comet 3I/ATLAS as of December 5, 2025</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that it is closely monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently about 286 million kilometers from Earth, as it passes through the solar system. Observations have intensified following the comet's re-examination by the Hubble Space Telescope on November 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This monitoring is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. NASA aims to gather data on the comet's activity and composition as it approaches its closest point to Earth, expected around December 19, 2025. The agency is utilizing multiple spacecraft to collect comprehensive measurements of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 286 million kilometers from Earth as of December 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>Hubble Space Telescope reobserved the comet on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nasa's Psyche spacecraft collected images of the comet in September 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Ground-based observations suggest the comet may be venting material from cryovolcanoes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 2025, NASA's Psyche spacecraft directed its multispectral imager towards 3I/ATLAS, capturing images when the comet was approximately 53 million kilometers away. Then, on November 30, 2025, Hubble reobserved the comet using its Wide Field Camera 3, tracking its movement to refine data on its activity and composition.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, NASA anticipates valuable insights into its structure and behavior, particularly as it exhibits signs of venting material.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These new data will help refine the comet’s activity, coma structure, and composition as it swings through the inner solar system,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is a rare example of a natural comet from another planetary system, providing scientists with a unique opportunity to study primordial material formed around a distant star. This event is part of a broader interest in interstellar objects, as they can offer insights into the formation of our solar system and beyond.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, gathering data to enhance understanding of its composition and behavior. Further observations are planned leading up to its closest approach.</p>
