      <h2>Recent Colorado UFO sightings: ‘Sparkling’ craft, ‘possible abduction’</h2>

<p>Six UFO sightings have been reported in Colorado throughout September, including a “sparkling” craft and an incident involving a possible abduction, according to the National UFO Reporting Center. The sightings occurred at various locations, with the most notable incident taking place at the Bureau of Land Management in Rabbit Valley on September 25.</p>

<p>This surge in sightings has drawn attention from both the public and authorities. The National UFO Reporting Center, a non-profit agency based in Washington state, has opened investigations into the claims. The center is known for its independence and anonymity policies, which encourage reports from the public.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 1, two sightings occurred in Longmont. One observer reported lights moving from west to east, with the lights appearing to sparkle. The second sighting featured a blue-grey oval object, about 100 feet long, flying quietly across the sky.</p>

<p>On September 9, a dark orb was spotted in Denver. The center attributed this sighting to a possible balloon. On September 18, observers in Colorado Springs reported lights in a triangular formation. The most prominent incident took place on September 25 when a visitor at the Knowles Campground in Rabbit Valley reported a black disc that landed nearby.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
