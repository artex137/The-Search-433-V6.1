      <h2>Harvard Astrophysicist Suggests 3I/ATLAS May Be Influenced by Forces Beyond Gravity</h2>

<p>A Harvard astrophysicist has sparked discussion in the scientific community regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may be influenced by forces other than gravity. Professor Avi Loeb, who leads Harvard University's Galileo Project, made these comments in a blog post on Medium, indicating that the object's trajectory through the solar system shows unusual features that standard celestial mechanics may not fully explain.</p>

<p>This debate matters as it challenges existing understandings of celestial mechanics and the nature of interstellar objects. Authorities, including NASA, have urged caution, noting that while 3I/ATLAS has shown some unusual traits, it predominantly resembles known comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (formally designated C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 29–30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Perihelion:</strong> Approximately 1.4 astronomical units (AU)</li>
    <li><strong>Carbon-Dioxide-to-Water Ratio:</strong> 8 ± 1</li>
    <li><strong>Surface Activity:</strong> Over 20% active</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Lower Mass Limit:</strong> About 33 billion tons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile. The object’s hyperbolic trajectory indicated it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. It reached its closest approach to the Sun around October 29–30, 2023, at a distance of approximately 1.4 AU. Following this, astronomers have been monitoring its motion for any post-perihelion changes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"The lack of non-gravitational acceleration implies an unusually high mass for an interstellar comet," said Professor Avi Loeb.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>"3I/ATLAS looks like a comet and very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know," stated NASA planetary scientist Tom Statler.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Both previous objects displayed unexpected properties that were later attributed to natural causes. Loeb's previous claims regarding ‘Oumuamua being an artificial probe have continued to generate controversy in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS's trajectory as it travels back toward interstellar space. Any motion deviations unexplained by outgassing or solar pressure could lend support to Loeb's hypothesis or reaffirm that the object's behavior aligns with natural celestial mechanics.</p>
