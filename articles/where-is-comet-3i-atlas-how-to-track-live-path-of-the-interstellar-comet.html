      <h2>Where is Comet 3I/ATLAS? How to Track Live Path of the Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has surprised astronomers with a newly observed "anti-tail," extending toward the Sun, as it exits our solar system. The Hubble Space Telescope captured images of this phenomenon on January 7, 2026, reigniting scientific interest in the comet's unusual behavior.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about cometary behavior. Authorities, including NASA, continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS despite its departure, providing tools for enthusiasts and researchers to track its trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, and passed Earth at a distance of approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometres) on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>New images from Hubble were taken on January 7, 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently beyond the orbit of Mars and fading in brightness.</li>
    <li>NASA states that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet rich in carbon dioxide.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, marking its entry into our solar system. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, and made a safe flyby of Earth on December 19, 2025. Observations continued until January 7, 2026, when Hubble captured images of the comet's unusual "anti-tail."</p>

<p>As of mid-January 2026, 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory, moving away from Earth and into interstellar space. It remains visible to powerful telescopes for several months.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Usually, the elongated feature around comets is oriented away from the Sun,” noted Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb. “The persistence of this sunward jet suggests that 3I/ATLAS may be rotating in a highly unusual manner.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, it has provided a longer observation period, allowing for more detailed study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to track 3I/ATLAS with instruments like Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope. They will monitor its deceleration and spectral changes as it moves further into interstellar space.</p>
