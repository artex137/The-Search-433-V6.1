      <h2>Alain Nu Reveals Top 10 Paranormal Events of 2025</h2>

<p>Alain Nu, known as “The Man Who Knows,” has revealed his list of the Top 10 Paranormal Events of 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada, on December 28, 2025. The list includes significant UFO sightings, government disclosures, and unusual phenomena that have captured public interest this year.</p>

<p>This announcement matters as it highlights ongoing public fascination with the unexplained and underscores the need for transparency regarding unidentified phenomena. Authorities and experts are increasingly discussing the implications of these events on scientific understanding and public policy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>February 2025: UFO sighting grounds flights at Gaziantep Airport, Turkey.</li>
<li>September 2025: U.S. House Task Force releases UAP video during a public hearing.</li>
<li>October 2025: Over 9,000 Unidentified Submersible Objects reported near U.S. coastlines.</li>
<li>October 2025: Bigfoot sighting reported by a driver in Centre County, Pennsylvania.</li>
<li>November 2025: George Knapp discloses details of a covert U.S. government UFO program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In February 2025, pilots at Gaziantep Airport in Turkey reported an unidentified flying object near 10,000 feet, leading to a temporary halt of flights. Authorities speculated it could have been a drone, but online discussions suggested the possibility of extraterrestrial contact.</p>

<p>In September 2025, during a public hearing, the U.S. House Oversight Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets reviewed military UAP sightings, including new footage showing a UAP unaffected by a missile. This event emphasized the need for transparency and data collection regarding UAPs.</p>

<p>October 2025 saw numerous reports of Unidentified Submersible Objects near U.S. coastlines, raising questions about unexplained activities in coastal areas. Additionally, credible reports of a Bigfoot sighting in Centre County, Pennsylvania, sparked local interest in unexplained wildlife.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“2025 was extraordinary for the unexplained. From UFOs grounding flights to Bigfoot sightings, the world continues to challenge our understanding of what’s possible,” said Alain Nu. “People are fascinated by the unknown because it challenges them to think beyond what they’ve been taught.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This year has seen a resurgence in public interest regarding unidentified aerial phenomena, with multiple reports and studies suggesting a connection between UAP sightings and government secrecy. The discussions surrounding these events reflect a growing call for accountability and transparency in government investigations of unexplained phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, Alain Nu predicts that 2026 could be a pivotal year for paranormal disclosure, with more governments and scientists acknowledging previously dismissed phenomena. Investigations into these events are expected to continue as public interest remains high.</p>
