      <h2>UFO sightings over US city of Denver revealed as skydivers for NFL team</h2>

<p>On November 5, 2025, residents of Denver observed a series of red lights in the sky, sparking speculation about Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The lights, seen in the East Park Hill neighbourhood near downtown, have been identified as a practice jump by the Denver Broncos’ skydiving team, known as the "Thunderstorm." There were no injuries reported.</p>

<p>This incident highlights the common occurrence of misidentified aerial phenomena, often attributed to human activities. Authorities have confirmed that the lights were part of a routine practice session involving flares or illuminated markers for an upcoming game day performance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: November 5, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: East Park Hill neighbourhood, Denver</li>
    <li>Identified source: Denver Broncos’ “Thunderstorm” parachute team</li>
    <li>No injuries reported</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the evening of November 5, residents captured video footage of four glowing red orbs moving slowly in formation. The video quickly went viral on social media, leading to widespread speculation about the objects possibly being extraterrestrial in nature.</p>

<p>Following the speculation, air traffic control data and public event schedules confirmed the lights were part of a practice session by the Broncos’ skydiving team. This conclusion alleviated concerns regarding the unidentified objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The conclusion from the incident represents a common result in such sightings as the majority of UFO cases are ultimately explained by human technology or natural phenomena,”</blockquote> said a spokesperson from the Denver Broncos.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Unidentified Flying Objects, or UFOs, are defined as objects or phenomena seen in the sky that have not yet been identified or explained. The term was first used during investigations by the United States Air Force (USAF) into flying saucers, which revealed a wide range of shapes and sizes. The recent incident in Denver is consistent with previous occurrences where similar sightings have been traced back to mundane explanations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any further investigations related to this incident, as it has been resolved. The Denver Broncos' skydiving team will continue their practice sessions in preparation for future performances.</p>
