      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS carries water across the stars</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is releasing water as it travels through our solar system. Discovered this summer, 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet and was observed by a team at Auburn University using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</p>

<p>This finding is significant because it marks the first detection of hydroxyl (OH) from an interstellar object, indicating that 3I/ATLAS is shedding water even at a distance where typical comets remain dormant. Researchers aim to understand the composition of comets across different star systems, which may reveal insights into the ingredients necessary for life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>Auburn University scientists detected water production at a rate of approximately 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The comet was nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth when the detection occurred.</li>
    <li>Swift’s Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope is 30 centimeters in diameter.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to become visible again after mid-November 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2023, astronomers first observed 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Shortly thereafter, the team at Auburn University used NASA’s Swift Observatory to conduct observations. During these observations, they detected a faint ultraviolet glow from hydroxyl gas, confirming the presence of water.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approached the Sun, researchers noted that the comet was releasing water at an unusually high rate for its distance. The results have been compared to previous observations of other interstellar comets, highlighting the differences in their chemical compositions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Catching 3I/ATLAS’s faint ultraviolet signature was a technical coup,” said a researcher from Auburn University. “It allows us to connect this interstellar visitor to decades of comet studies.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery follows the detection of other interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, which displayed different characteristics and chemical signatures. Previous comets like 2I/Borisov have also provided insights into the diversity of cometary compositions across star systems. The study of comets is crucial for understanding the building blocks of life and how they vary throughout the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible again in mid-November. They will investigate whether the water output increases as the comet approaches the Sun and whether additional volatiles are released.</p>
