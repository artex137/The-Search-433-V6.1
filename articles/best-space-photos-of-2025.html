      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Dominates Space Photography in 2025</h2>

<p>In 2025, stunning images of the alien comet 3I/ATLAS have captivated astronomers and space enthusiasts alike, following its discovery in early July as it sped through the solar system. The comet has drawn significant attention, marking it as the third interstellar object ever observed.</p>

<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS has prompted a surge of photographic interest, with various astronomical observatories capturing remarkable images. Authorities expect that these visuals will enhance public engagement with space science and inspire further exploration.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered: Early July 2025</li>
    <li>Notable image captured: Timelapse image from Gemini North telescope, Mauna Kea, Hawaii</li>
    <li>Astrophotographer: Andrew McCarthy</li>
    <li>Distance of skydiver during photo capture: 8,000 feet (2,440 meters)</li>
    <li>Vera C. Rubin Observatory revealed first images: June 2025</li>
    <li>Arsia Mons volcano height: More than 12 miles (19 kilometers)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July 2025, astronomers first spotted comet 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. By June, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile's Atacama Desert unveiled its first images, showcasing cosmic phenomena. In November, astrophotographer Andrew McCarthy captured a unique photo of a skydiver falling before the sun, an image that became widely celebrated.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, various other astronomical events, including a planetary parade and images from NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter, have further enriched the collection of space photography.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It was a narrow field of view, so it took several attempts to line up the shot,” said Andrew McCarthy, discussing the challenges of capturing his photo of the skydiver. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of comet 3I/ATLAS continues the trend of increased interest in interstellar objects, following the previous sightings of 1I/2017 U1 and 2I/Borisov. The advancements in telescope technology, such as those seen at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are expected to yield more groundbreaking images in the future.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As astronomers continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS, they anticipate further photographic opportunities and data collection as the comet approaches its closest point to the Sun. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will also begin a decade-long survey of the night sky, promising more discoveries ahead.</p>
