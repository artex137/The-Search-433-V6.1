      <h2>Ionic tail of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS grows and reaches 0.7 degrees in new image</h2>

<p>New images of interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> show that its ionic tail has grown to <strong>0.7 degrees</strong> across the sky. The capture occurred on <strong>November 11, 2025</strong>, by the Virtual Telescope Project in Italy, despite a <strong>61%</strong> illuminated Moon and low horizon visibility.</p>

<p>This development indicates increased activity of the comet as it approaches the Sun. The images combine 18 exposures of 120 seconds each, taken by robotic telescopes in Manciano. The enhanced tail structure suggests significant sublimation of volatiles, such as carbon dioxide, as the comet nears its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was 14 degrees above the eastern horizon during imaging.</li>
    <li>The imaging occurred around midnight on November 11, 2025.</li>
    <li>Favorable climatic conditions allowed for improved visibility and detail.</li>
    <li>The comet's ionic tail is distinct from its dust tail, which has a yellowish tone.</li>
    <li>A live broadcast of future observations is scheduled for November 17 at 1:15 am.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On <strong>November 9, 2025</strong>, astronomers observed unusual structures in the tail of 3I/ATLAS when the Moon was <strong>82%</strong> illuminated and the comet was at a height of 9-12 degrees.</p>
<p>On <strong>November 11, 2025</strong>, the Virtual Telescope Project captured the latest image, revealing a well-defined ionic tail and a compact coma around the comet's nucleus.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The increase in the ionic tail confirms the release of carbon dioxide and dust,” said a representative from the Virtual Telescope Project. “This reveals characteristics of the origin star system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its brightness allows for detailed studies with terrestrial telescopes, providing insights into its composition and origin outside the Solar System.</p>
<p>Prior observations of 3I/ATLAS have documented increasing activity, particularly as it approaches perihelion. The latest imaging builds on earlier findings of unusual tail structures.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Virtual Telescope Project plans to continue monitoring the comet's path through the inner Solar System. Data collected will enhance understanding of interstellar comets and their interactions with the Sun.</p>
