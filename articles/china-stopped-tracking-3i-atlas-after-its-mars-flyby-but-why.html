      <h2>China stopped tracking 3I/ATLAS after its Mars flyby</h2>

<p>China has ceased tracking the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after its encounter with Mars in early September, raising questions among global astronomers. The last recorded data from Chinese observatories indicated a significant drop in signal strength just before the object moved behind the Sun relative to Earth.</p>

<p>This lack of follow-up observations has prompted concerns regarding the reasons behind China's sudden silence. Chinese space officials have attributed the suspension of monitoring to "instrument scheduling conflicts" with other missions, but experts argue that this could reflect a broader issue of data sharing and transparency in space observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Last observation of 3I/ATLAS by China occurred in early September 2023.</li>
    <li>China's Purple Mountain Observatory and CNSA’s Deep Space Network confirmed the object's interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>Signal strength drop noted at Xinjiang 35-metre radio dish before the object passed behind the Sun.</li>
    <li>Chinese space officials cited "instrument scheduling conflicts" with the Chang’e-7 lunar mission and Queqiao-2 relay calibration.</li>
    <li>European and Indian observatories, including Gaia and ESO, have continued to track the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late August 2023, as 3I/ATLAS approached Mars, the Purple Mountain Observatory and CNSA’s Deep Space Network released trajectory models confirming its interstellar origin. The last public dataset from China was recorded at the Xinjiang 35-metre radio dish in early September, showing a drop in signal strength. After this observation, no further data was logged on the National Astronomical Data Centre portal.</p>

<p>Following the lack of data from China, astronomers from European and Indian observatories stepped in to continue monitoring the comet's trajectory. This collaborative effort aimed to fill the gap left by China's silence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Instrument scheduling conflicts” have temporarily suspended monitoring of interstellar objects, according to a spokesperson from the China National Space Administration (CNSA).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Every lost observation narrows our window to understand what 3I/ATLAS really is,” said Harvard physicist Avi Loeb on the Joe Rogan Experience.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The cessation of tracking 3I/ATLAS follows a pattern observed in previous interstellar phenomena, where data sharing has been limited due to concerns over national security and strategic sensitivity. Chinese researchers have indicated that data from deep-space observations may now be classified when they overlap with defence frequencies.</p>

<p>This incident highlights the growing intersection of scientific research and geopolitical considerations in space exploration, as nations prioritize their strategic interests over transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As global observatories continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, discussions around the need for improved data sharing and collaboration among nations are expected to intensify. The scientific community awaits further updates on the comet's trajectory and the implications of China's silence on future interstellar observation efforts.</p>
