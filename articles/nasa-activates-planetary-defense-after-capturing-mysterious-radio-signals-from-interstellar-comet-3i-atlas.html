      <h2>NASA activates planetary defense after capturing mysterious radio signals from interstellar comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>The global scientific community has focused on deep space following the detection of radio signals from interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, captured in October 2025. The signals challenge existing models of celestial emissions and have prompted discussions regarding the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, according to the Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária of NASA.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it has led to the activation of planetary defense protocols. Authorities are mobilizing tracking resources globally to analyze the signals and ensure the safety of Earth. Preliminary data has indicated that the radio waves exhibit characteristics not typically associated with common comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Signal detected in October 2025 using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>Frequency of the detected transmission is 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>Closest approach of comet 3I/Atlas to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>ATLAS system, responsible for the comet's discovery, is funded by NASA and operated by the University of Hawaii.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS system first discovered comet 3I/Atlas. By October 2025, scientists detected unusual radio signals emanating from the comet. Following this detection, global authorities assessed the risks and activated planetary defense protocols. The comet made its closest pass to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The emission presented a coherence that led to the immediate notification of aerospace control centers,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Our objective is to triangulate the exact source within the comet’s structure,” stated a researcher involved in the investigation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object confirmed to enter our solar system, following Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Each of these comets offers a unique opportunity to study other star systems without the need for distant probes. The diverse characteristics of these interstellar visitors highlight the richness of our galaxy and the importance of improving detection technologies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the signals from 3I/Atlas using various observatories, including the Very Large Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope, to identify specific molecules that may explain the radio emissions. Ongoing assessments will determine if the signals indicate an artificial origin or a natural phenomenon.</p>
