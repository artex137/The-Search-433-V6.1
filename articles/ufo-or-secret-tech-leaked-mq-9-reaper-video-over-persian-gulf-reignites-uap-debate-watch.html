      <h2>UFO or Secret Tech? Leaked MQ-9 Reaper Video Over Persian Gulf Reignites UAP Debate</h2>

<p>Leaked footage from a US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone has sparked renewed discussions about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) after investigative journalists Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp claimed it shows UFO-like objects over the Persian Gulf. The video, which dates back to 2012, surfaced publicly on February 7, 2026, and has gone viral across social media platforms.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it comes amid ongoing investigations into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). Authorities, including the Pentagon, have maintained a cautious stance regarding these sightings, stating they have not confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial technology or beings, despite some aerial encounters remaining unexplained.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video recorded by a US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone.</li>
    <li>Footage dates back to 2012 but was publicly released on February 7, 2026.</li>
    <li>Claimed to show glowing orb-like objects over the Persian Gulf.</li>
    <li>Investigative journalists Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp are associated with the platform WEAPONIZED.</li>
    <li>Objects in footage categorized as UAPs by the US intelligence community.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2012, the MQ-9 Reaper drone recorded footage of unidentified objects over the Persian Gulf. The video remained classified until it was leaked by an unnamed source within the US intelligence community, reaching the public on February 7, 2026.</p>

<p>Following the leak, the video gained significant attention on social media, prompting discussions surrounding the potential existence of non-human technology. Investigative journalists Corbell and Knapp have emphasized the unusual behavior exhibited by the objects, such as sudden acceleration, as evidence of capabilities beyond known aircraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Jeremy and George have a proven track record of getting authentic Pentagon footage into the public domain,” said Nick Pope, a former UFO investigator for the UK’s Ministry of Defence. “But these were Middle East videos in one of the most crowded areas of sky when it comes to cutting-edge aerospace technology.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has consistently maintained skepticism regarding claims of extraterrestrial technology. While acknowledging that some aerial encounters remain unexplained, it has stated that it has not collected physical evidence supporting the existence of non-human craft. Reports indicate that the objects in the leaked footage have been placed in a “non-human” category by the US intelligence community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the leaked footage and its implications for UAP research are ongoing. Authorities are expected to continue examining the video and its context to determine the nature of the objects captured. Further disclosures from the Pentagon regarding UAP sightings may follow as public interest grows.</p>
