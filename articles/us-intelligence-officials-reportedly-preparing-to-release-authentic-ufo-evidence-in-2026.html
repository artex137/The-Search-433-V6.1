      <h2>US Intelligence Officials Reportedly Preparing To Release Authentic UFO Evidence In 2026</h2>

<p>A new documentary has sparked renewed public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the possibility of official UFO evidence being disclosed in 2026. The documentary, titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, features insights from 34 current and former officials from government, military, and intelligence sectors, and was released in November 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this topic.</p>

<p>This renewed fascination highlights the potential for significant shifts in government transparency regarding UAP. Authorities are currently facing increasing pressure from Congress to provide information and briefings about UAP encounters, particularly those occurring since 2004. The documentary has reportedly broken Prime Video's documentary revenue record within 48 hours, suggesting a strong public interest in the subject.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Documentary title:</strong> The Age of Disclosure</li>
    <li><strong>Release date:</strong> November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Number of officials featured:</strong> 34</li>
    <li><strong>Secretary of State:</strong> Marco Rubio</li>
    <li><strong>Fiscal year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act:</strong> Requires briefings on UAP from the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office</li>
    <li><strong>Reported incidents:</strong> 757 new UAP incident reports logged by the Pentagon in November 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Unexplained incidents:</strong> 21 incidents remain unexplained near sensitive national security sites</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, former Air Force intelligence officer David Grusch testified before Congress, claiming the government operates covert programs to recover and reverse-engineer non-human craft. His testimony has fueled speculation about the government's knowledge of UAP.</p>

<p>On November 2024, the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office released its annual report, logging 757 new UAP incidents. This report emphasized that 21 of these incidents remain unexplained, particularly near sensitive military sites.</p>

<p>The documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> was released in November 2025, breaking revenue records and generating significant public interest in UAP and government disclosures.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The craft does not belong to the United States,” said Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the documentary, discussing sightings above restricted nuclear sites.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Public attitudes have shifted. All of these are squeezing government secrecy from multiple directions,” said filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee regarding the current climate surrounding UAP.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Incontrovertible evidence could destabilise financial systems within hours,” warned Helen McCaw, a former senior analyst at the Bank of England.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, the U.S. government has declassified thousands of UFO-related documents, but skeptics argue these have not provided hard evidence of extraterrestrial visitors. The Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office maintains that it has found no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology.</p>

<p>However, the combination of political will, legal requirements, and heightened public curiosity has led some to believe that 2026 may mark a significant turning point in UAP disclosure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Congress continues to press for transparency, the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office is expected to provide briefings on UAP intercepts. Investigations into the classification of relevant materials are also anticipated in the coming months.</p>
