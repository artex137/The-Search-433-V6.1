      <h2>'Good luck with aliens!' Mysterious 'silver canister' spotted near plane over Rhode Island in viral ATC audio</h2>

<p>A pilot flying a Piper PA-32RT-300T Turbo Lance II over Rhode Island has reported spotting a small silver canister hovering just feet from his wingtip at 3,500 feet altitude. The sighting occurred during a flight that has since gained attention due to a resurfaced air traffic control (ATC) audio clip. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the incident.</p>

<p>This sighting matters as it contributes to ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and raises questions about aviation safety. Authorities, including the FAA, have not publicly commented on the specific report, which aligns with their policy on unverified UFO sightings that do not pose safety risks.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred over Rhode Island, altitude of 3,500 feet.</li>
    <li>The pilot reported the sighting during real-time communication with ATC.</li>
    <li>The ATC audio clip was posted on YouTube by the VASAviation channel around October 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>No known objects were confirmed in the area by ATC at the time of the sighting.</li>
    <li>The FAA has not identified the object as a drone, balloon, or otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 27, 2025, a pilot flying over Rhode Island reported a small silver canister floating near his wing. The ATC audio captures the pilot's astonishment as he describes the object as stationary and unattached.</p>

<p>ATC responded to the report with surprise, stating, "Creepy!" and jokingly adding, "Good luck with the aliens." This exchange reflects the informal tone among controllers during non-critical situations.</p>

<p>The incident has since gone viral on social media, sparking debates about the authenticity of the sighting and the nature of the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It floated by right off the wing, standing still in midair without visible support,” the pilot noted during communication with ATC.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATC controllers responded, “Creepy!” and one added, “Good luck with the aliens,” highlighting the unexpected nature of the sighting.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a growing pattern of pilot-reported UAP sightings, where objects behave in ways that defy conventional aircraft behavior. Similar sightings, such as multi-target lights over Eugene, Oregon, in late 2024, prompted FAA acknowledgments but no further identification. These cases illustrate the challenges of real-time verification of UAP reports.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The FAA has not indicated any plans to investigate this specific sighting further, as it poses no safety risk. Future discussions may focus on broader patterns of UAP sightings and their implications for aviation safety and regulation.</p>
