      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Reveals Mysterious Tail As It Heads Into Our Solar System</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar visitor, has been racing through our solar system since its discovery in July 2025. This comet is the third known object to arrive from beyond our solar system and is exhibiting unusual characteristics that have captivated astronomers.</p>

<p>Scientists are closely studying Comet 3I/ATLAS due to its bizarre chemical makeup and unexpected activity. Authorities, including NASA, have deployed powerful telescopes such as Hubble and James Webb to gather data and insights about this unusual celestial body.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet has the highest carbon dioxide-to-water ratio ever observed in a comet.</li>
    <li>It was active while still six astronomical units away from the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Hubble and James Webb telescopes have been used for observations.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass by Venus, Mars, and Jupiter as it continues its journey.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered as it approaches the Sun.</p>
<p>August 2025: NASA’s telescopes begin to observe the comet, revealing its unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Future: The comet will swing past several planets in the solar system, providing opportunities for further observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS carries secrets from another corner of the galaxy,” said a NASA representative, highlighting the importance of the comet for understanding interstellar bodies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet’s behavior is unlike any seen before, presenting a fascinating puzzle for scientists,” noted Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who has speculated about its origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects are rare, and 3I/ATLAS’s unusual properties challenge existing theories about comet formation. Previous interstellar visitors have not shown such distinctive chemical compositions or activity levels.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists are hopeful that probes like NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Juno will capture additional data during its passes by the inner planets.</p>
