      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS nears closest approach to Earth this Friday</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on Friday, December 19, at a distance of approximately 167 million miles (1.8 astronomical units). Discovered on July 1 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, the comet has posed no danger to Earth, according to NASA officials.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks the third confirmed object from outside our solar system to visit the inner planets. Authorities, including NASA, have monitored the comet’s trajectory and characteristics closely. Recent observations have revealed intriguing details about its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 167 million miles (1.8 AU)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29-30, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size: between 1,400 feet and 3.5 miles wide</li>
    <li>Comet emissions include carbon dioxide, water vapor, cyanide gas, and atomic nickel vapor</li>
    <li>Next significant approach: Jupiter in March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile. It followed a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29-30, 2025, at approximately 1.4 AU, just inside Mars’ orbit. It is now on a path that will see it reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>
<p>Following its approach to Earth, 3I/ATLAS will head towards Jupiter in March 2026 before leaving the solar system, likely by the mid-2030s.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “There is no danger to Earth from this comet, which will come no closer than 170 million miles,” NASA stated in updates regarding the object’s path.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The evidence suggests that 3I/ATLAS was once probably a short-period comet around its host star and it was heavily thermally processed,” said geophysicist Stefan Burns, who has analyzed the comet's characteristics.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three confirmed interstellar objects to pass through our solar system. Its unique characteristics, including organic-rich composition and recent color shifts, provide valuable data for astronomers studying the origins of such celestial bodies. The current solar maximum cycle has also drawn interest from scientists, linking solar activity to the comet's passage.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it moves towards Jupiter. Updates on its trajectory and characteristics will be shared through various scientific channels.</p>
