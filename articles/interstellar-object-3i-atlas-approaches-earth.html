      <h2>Interstellar object ‘3I/ATLAS’ approaches Earth</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to Earth on December 23, 2025, and is now moving out of the Solar System, according to NASA. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the comet.</p>

<p>This event represents a significant opportunity for scientists to study an object formed in another star system. Authorities, including NASA and various astronomical organizations, have mobilized their telescopes to capture data on 3I/ATLAS before it exits the Solar System. This comet is only the third known interstellar object to be detected passing through our Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS first discovered on July 1, 2025, by a telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Initial observation was part of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) program.</li>
    <li>NASA identified the comet's extrasolar origin through its hyperbolic orbital path.</li>
    <li>Key observational tools include the James Webb Telescope, Perseverance Rover, and Psyche spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Notable chemical composition includes heightened levels of diatomic carbon (C2).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025, during an automatic sky scan in Chile. After its initial discovery, astronomers traced its orbital path back to June 14, establishing its extrasolar origin.</p>

<p>As it approached Earth, various observatories, including NASA, began to study the comet's characteristics and composition. The comet reached its closest point to Earth on December 23, 2025, before continuing its journey out of the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These things have probably been flying through the Solar System for a very long time, and it’s not that unusual,” said David DeBruyn, curator-emeritus of the Roger B. Chaffee Planetarium.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The chemical makeup is going to be slightly different than our Solar System because it formed from a collection of material that would be very similar to but not identical to our Solar System,” said Lauren Woolsey, professor of astronomy at Grand Rapids Community College.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects have been identified in our Solar System. The discovery of such comets is rare due to their difficult detection compared to traditional comets that originate from within the Solar System.</p>

<p>The study of interstellar comets provides insights into the composition and formation of materials in other star systems, allowing researchers to compare them with our own Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS exits the Solar System, researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from various telescopes. This analysis may yield insights into the differences between interstellar and Solar System comets.</p>
