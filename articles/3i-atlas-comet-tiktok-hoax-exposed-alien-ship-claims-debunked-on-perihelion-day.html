      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet TikTok Hoax Exposed: Alien Ship Claims Debunked on Perihelion Day</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked a TikTok frenzy, with users sharing videos claiming it is an alien spacecraft as it approaches perihelion on 30 October 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the viral claims. The phenomenon has captivated millions, leading to widespread speculation and debate.</p>

<p>This situation matters as it highlights the intersection of social media, scientific discovery, and public perception. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have worked to clarify the comet's true nature, emphasizing that it is a natural celestial object and not an extraterrestrial craft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>It has a nucleus diameter estimated between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA telescopes have detected carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water in its gas plume.</li>
    <li>The comet has been observed travelling at 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Viral TikTok videos have garnered millions of views, with one clip alone reaching over 5 million views.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, has suggested the comet may exhibit unusual features, rating its technological origin a 4/10.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers first observed 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS telescope in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile. This marked its entry into the scientific community as the third confirmed interstellar object. Pre-discovery images from June 2025 extended tracking of the comet.</p>

<p>On 21 July, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet's teardrop-shaped dust cocoon. The James Webb Space Telescope later examined the comet on 6 August, detecting key components of its gas plume.</p>

<p>As it neared perihelion, TikTok users began posting videos claiming to show the comet as an alien ship, leading to a surge of interest and misinformation. Meanwhile, ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter conducted observations on 3 October.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it is a natural comet... its heating by 770 watts per square meter may break it up,” said Avi Loeb, raising concerns about the comet's behavior as it approaches the sun.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It has a coma, an envelope of vaporised ices, surrounding it. It has a glittering tail,” astronomers countered, highlighting the natural characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussions surrounding 3I/ATLAS echo previous debates over interstellar objects, notably 1I/‘Oumuamua. The blend of scientific inquiry and public speculation often leads to misconceptions about natural phenomena, especially in the age of social media.</p>

<p>This incident underscores the challenges faced by scientists in combating misinformation while trying to engage the public in astronomical discovery.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches perihelion on 30 October, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. Further observations and analyses will help clarify any remaining uncertainties about the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>
