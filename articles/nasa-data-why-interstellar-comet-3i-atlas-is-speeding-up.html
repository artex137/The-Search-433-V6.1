      <h2>NASA data: Why interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is speeding up</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is speeding up as it approaches the Sun, with its current trajectory being closely monitored by astronomers. The comet, which was first detected in December 2019, is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun on May 31, 2024.</p>

<p>This increase in speed is significant because it provides insights into the comet's composition and behavior as it interacts with the Sun's gravitational pull. Researchers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) are analyzing the data to better understand the dynamics of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected in December 2019.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun is scheduled for May 31, 2024.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently speeding up due to solar gravitational effects.</li>
    <li>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is monitoring the comet's trajectory.</li>
    <li>The comet is classified as an interstellar object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>December 2019: Comet 3I/ATLAS is first detected by astronomers.</p>
<p>May 31, 2024: The comet is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The increase in speed as the comet nears the Sun is a fascinating phenomenon that helps us understand the behavior of interstellar objects,” said a researcher from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar comets, providing scientists with valuable data about the materials that exist outside our solar system. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have also sparked interest in the study of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and speed as it approaches the Sun, with further analysis expected to yield more information about its composition and origin.</p>
