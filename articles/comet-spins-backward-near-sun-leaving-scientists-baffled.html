      <h2>Comet spins backward near sun, leaving scientists baffled</h2>

<p>Comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresák has unexpectedly reversed its spin direction while nearing the Sun, according to observations from multiple space telescopes. The phenomenon was first tracked in early 2017 and has raised new questions about comet behavior.</p>

<p>This unusual event is significant for scientists as it challenges existing theories about how comet activity can impact their rotation. Researchers are studying the mechanisms behind this reversal to better understand the dynamics of cometary bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresák observed during its close approach to the Sun in 2017.</li>
    <li>Initial spin period recorded in early 2017 was approximately 20 hours.</li>
    <li>Rotation slowed to about 46 hours between March and May 2017.</li>
    <li>By December 2017, the comet began rotating in the opposite direction with a period near 14 hours.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Swift spacecraft and the Hubble Space Telescope were instrumental in tracking these changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early 2017, astronomers first recorded the spin period of Comet 41P at around 20 hours. Between March and May of that year, the comet's rotation slowed significantly, extending its spin period to approximately 46 hours. By December 2017, observations indicated that the comet had reversed its spin direction, rotating every 14 hours.</p>

<p>Researchers, including UCLA astronomer David Jewitt, utilized Hubble’s imaging to analyze the changes in the comet’s rotation, revealing a considerable alteration in its angular momentum.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reversal wasn’t a small wobble—it was a large-scale change in angular momentum that required significant torque on the nucleus,” said David Jewitt, a UCLA astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of comet behavior have primarily focused on smaller, more rapid spin variations. Comet 41P’s dramatic change in rotation challenges the understanding of how such celestial objects evolve over time. Astronomers believe that understanding these dynamics could shed light on the lifecycle of comets and their potential to break apart.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Comet 41P is expected to return to the inner solar system in 2028, providing further opportunities for observation. Researchers plan to utilize upcoming facilities, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, to monitor its rotation and activity more closely.</p>
