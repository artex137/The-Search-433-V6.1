      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth This Month – NASA Clarifies Risks</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to approach Earth on December 19, 2023, at a safe distance of approximately 270 million kilometers, according to NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This comet, classified as an interstellar visitor, is significant for scientific research as it presents a unique opportunity to study materials from outside our Solar System. Authorities, including NASA, are actively monitoring its trajectory and characteristics using both space and ground-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 270 million kilometers away during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>It is the third identified interstellar object in the Solar System, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was initially detected in July 2023 and later classified as a comet.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to be around seven billion years old.</li>
    <li>NASA's SPHEREx mission has identified carbon dioxide in the comet's coma, which extends for about 350 kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has emitted a radio signal during its journey through the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023 under the temporary name A11pl3Z. It was quickly classified as an interstellar comet and received the designations C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) and 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>The comet reached its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2023. After passing close to Mars, it became visible again following a brief period of being obscured by the sun's glare.</p>
<p>Recent observations have indicated the presence of active "ice volcanoes" on its surface, and the scientific community has dismissed speculation regarding its potential alien origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The 3I/ATLAS spacecraft is not on a collision course with Earth,” said a NASA spokesperson. “The orbital calculations accumulated by observatories around the world confirm that the object does not pose a threat.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third interstellar object identified in our Solar System. Previous interstellar visitors include 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have also sparked significant scientific interest. The study of such objects can enhance our understanding of planetary formation processes and the composition of distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As December 19 approaches, astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS. There are no anticipated changes in its trajectory, and it is expected to exit the Solar System after its closest approach.</p>
