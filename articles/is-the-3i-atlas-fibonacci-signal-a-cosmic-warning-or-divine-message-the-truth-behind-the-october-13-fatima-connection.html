      <h2>Is the 3I/ATLAS Fibonacci Signal a Cosmic Warning or Divine Message?</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has reportedly emitted light pulses that some claim follow a mathematical pattern linked to the Fibonacci sequence. These signals were detected on 13 October 2025, coinciding with the 108th anniversary of the 'Miracle of the Sun' at Fátima, Portugal, leading to speculation about their significance.</p>

<p>This matter has sparked interest among researchers and the public. Authorities and scientists are examining the implications of these claims while addressing concerns about data accessibility and transparency regarding 3I/ATLAS. The controversy has drawn attention to NASA's handling of observational data related to the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Detection date: 13 October 2025</li>
    <li>Significance: 108th anniversary of the 'Miracle of the Sun' at Fátima</li>
    <li>Key numbers in Fibonacci sequence: 5, 8, 13</li>
    <li>Projected closest approach to Earth: 25 December 2025</li>
    <li>NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory: Closed</li>
    <li>Data blockage: High-resolution images from Mars HiRISE catalog blocked since 1 October 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 13 October 2025, signals from 3I/ATLAS were detected, which proponents claim follow the Fibonacci sequence. Researcher David Sereda has linked these signals to a broader cosmological theory involving a hyper-dimensional solar system.</p>
<p>From 1 October 2025, access to high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS from the Mars HiRISE catalogue has reportedly been restricted, leading to claims of a cover-up regarding the object’s true nature.</p>
<p>Sereda has indicated that the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS will bring it near the orbit of a hypothetical planet called 'Dominions (Planet 591)' between 19 and 25 October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The non-random nature of this signal points towards intelligent design,” said researcher David Sereda.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are treating the signal data as a 'leak' rather than verified information,” Sereda added, referring to the lack of official communication from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It is commonly found in nature and has been linked to various scientific phenomena. The claims surrounding 3I/ATLAS have raised questions about the intersection of science and belief, especially given the historical significance of the Fátima event.</p>
<p>Previous incidents involving celestial objects have often spurred public interest and speculation, particularly when linked to religious or prophetic themes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims surrounding 3I/ATLAS are ongoing. Researchers are expected to continue analyzing the signals and the implications of the object's trajectory as it approaches Earth in December 2025.</p>
