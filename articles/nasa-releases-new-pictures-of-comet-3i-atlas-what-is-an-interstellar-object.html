      <h2>NASA releases new pictures of Comet 3I/Atlas: What is an interstellar object?</h2>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released new images of Comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object that is billions of years old, on November 19. The images come from various NASA missions, including the Perseverance Mars rover and the MAVEN orbiter. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This release is significant as Comet 3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar object discovered, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, on July 1. NASA is closely monitoring its trajectory as it approaches Earth, with a closest flyby scheduled for December 19, at a distance of 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was first spotted on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 670 million km from the Sun at its discovery.</li>
    <li>It will fly closest to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA missions involved in capturing images include Perseverance, MAVEN, Psyche, Lucy, and PUNCH.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at a speed of 60 km/h at a distance of 670 million km from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, Comet 3I/Atlas was detected by the ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Since then, NASA has utilized multiple missions to capture images of this interstellar object. As of November 19, new images have been released to the public. The comet is set to pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It may be thousands of years until humans visit a planet in another solar system and interstellar comets offer the tantalising opportunity for us to touch something truly otherworldly,” the European Space Agency stated. “These wanderers offer a rare, tangible connection to the broader galaxy — to materials formed in environments entirely unlike our own.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar object identified, with the first two being 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The discovery of interstellar objects has increased with advancements in technology, allowing scientists to detect smaller and fainter celestial bodies that travel through our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth. Scientists will analyze its chemical composition to gain insights into its origins and the conditions of its home solar system.</p>
