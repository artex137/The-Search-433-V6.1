      <h2>Astronomers catch rare glimpse of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it flies by Mars</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed by Mars on October 3. The European Space Agency (ESA) recorded the comet using its Mars orbiters, ExoMars and Mars Express, which were positioned fewer than 200 miles above the Martian surface.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object recorded in the solar system. Authorities at ESA have stated that this event provides valuable data on the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was about 18.6 million miles from Mars when images were taken.</li>
    <li>The comet was first observed on July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>It is estimated to be 3 billion years older than the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet weighs more than 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Its nucleus is primarily composed of carbon dioxide gas and water ice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers first spotted comet 3I/ATLAS in Río Hurtado, Chile. Following this discovery, ESA's ExoMars and Mars Express orbiters captured images of the comet as it approached Mars on October 3. The orbiters successfully recorded the comet's icy-rocky nucleus and its surrounding coma, despite the challenges posed by the comet's faintness.</p>

<p>In November 2023, ESA plans to observe 3I/ATLAS again through its Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) during the comet's closest approach to the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one," said Colin Wilson, Mars Express and ExoMars project scientist at ESA.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "Scientists were unsure what to expect from observations of a relatively dim target so far away," according to ESA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event marks a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object, with 3I/ATLAS being only the third such object recorded in the solar system. The previous interstellar objects have provided insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA scientists will continue to analyze data from the Mars orbiters and plan further observations of 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach to the sun in November.</p>
