      <h2>Three Heliophysics Spacecraft Observe Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's STEREO, NASA/ESA SOHO, and NASA's PUNCH missions have tracked interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed behind the Sun from September 11 to October 3, 2025. The comet traveled at a speed of 209,000 km (130,000 miles) per hour.</p>

<p>This observation marks a significant achievement in heliophysics, as the spacecraft utilized advanced imaging techniques to capture data on the comet's size, physical properties, and chemical makeup. The missions are part of a broader effort to study solar activity and its influence across the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed from September 11 to October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>STEREO observed the comet from September 11 to October 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>SOHO captured images of the comet from October 15 to 26, 2025.</li>
    <li>PUNCH observed the comet from September 20 to October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet traveled at approximately 209,000 km (130,000 miles) per hour.</li>
    <li>SOHO's observations were made from about 358 million km (222 million miles) away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's STEREO mission began observing 3I/ATLAS on September 11, 2025, using the Heliospheric Imager-1 instrument. This allowed for the initial tracking of the comet as it passed behind the Sun. By stacking multiple images, STEREO successfully captured visible data on the comet.</p>

<p>SOHO began its observations on October 15, 2025, utilizing its Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instrument suite to view the comet from a distance of approximately 358 million km. The team applied similar image processing techniques to visualize the comet's trajectory.</p>

<p>PUNCH observed 3I/ATLAS from September 20 to October 3, 2025, revealing the comet's tail. Despite initial concerns about visibility, stacking observations allowed the team to capture clear images of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re really pushing the limits of the system,” said Dr. Kevin Walsh, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute who led PUNCH’s observations of the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS builds upon previous advancements in solar observation technology. Prior missions have enhanced understanding of solar activity and its effects, contributing to ongoing research in heliophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the data collected by STEREO, SOHO, and PUNCH is expected to provide additional insights into the comet's characteristics and behavior as it continues its journey through the Solar System.</p>
