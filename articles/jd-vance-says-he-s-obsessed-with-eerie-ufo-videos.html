      <h2>JD Vance says he's 'obsessed' with eerie UFO videos</h2>

<p>Vice President JD Vance has expressed his fascination with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during an appearance on the "Ruthless" podcast on Friday. Vance stated, "I'm obsessed with the whole UFO thing," and raised questions about the nature of recent UFO videos and incidents.</p>

<p>This interest comes amid ongoing investigations into unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) by various authorities, including the U.S. government. The House Oversight Committee has previously held hearings to explore these phenomena and the Pentagon's involvement in their investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Vance appeared on the "Ruthless" podcast on Friday.</li>
    <li>He has been in office for six months.</li>
    <li>Last November, the House Oversight Committee held a hearing on UAPs.</li>
    <li>A former Pentagon official testified that the U.S. government has evidence of extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>In December, SUV-sized drones were reported over New Jersey.</li>
    <li>The FAA authorized the drones seen in November for research purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2022, the House Oversight Committee conducted a hearing to investigate UAPs. During this session, several experts and witnesses testified about their experiences and knowledge regarding the phenomena.</p>

<p>One prominent witness, Luis Elizondo, former head of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), claimed that a group of officials is concealing information about extraterrestrial life. He referred to this group as a "cabal."</p>

<p>In December 2022, multiple reports emerged of large drones flying over New Jersey, leading to public concern. By late January 2023, the White House confirmed these drones were authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for research purposes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Excessive secrecy has lead to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public, all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos,” said Luis Elizondo during his testimony.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“After research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized by the FAA for research and various other reasons,” stated White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This recent surge in interest regarding UFOs follows a series of incidents and testimonies that have raised questions about government transparency in the investigation of aerial phenomena. The hearings and reports have sparked public curiosity and scrutiny.</p>

<p>The Pentagon's ongoing investigations into UAPs have led to claims of excessive secrecy and allegations of a cover-up regarding extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Vance has indicated plans to further explore UFO phenomena during the upcoming congressional recess in August. Investigations into UAPs and public discussions surrounding them are expected to continue as authorities seek to address public interest and concerns.</p>
