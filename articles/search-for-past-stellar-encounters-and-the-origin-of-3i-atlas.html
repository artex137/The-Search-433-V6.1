      <h2>Search For Past Stellar Encounters And The Origin Of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Researchers have studied comet 3I/ATLAS, the third discovered interstellar object, to explore its origin and past dynamical evolution. The findings have been submitted for review on September 3, 2025, and indicate that the object has a heliocentric speed of 58 km/s and exhibits cometary activity.</p>

<p>This research matters because understanding the origins of 3I/ATLAS can provide insights into stellar encounters and the dynamics of interstellar objects. The study integrates orbits of 3I/ATLAS with the orbits of 30 million Gaia stars to identify potential past encounters that could have influenced its trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has a heliocentric speed of 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>The study identifies 25 potential stellar encounters.</li>
    <li>Median encounter distances are less than 1 parsec (pc).</li>
    <li>The closest encounter occurred 1.64 million years ago at a distance of 0.242 pc.</li>
    <li>The maximum encounter speed recorded was 28.39 km/s.</li>
    <li>The strongest gravitational perturbation is from a wide M-dwarf binary system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The research team has propagated the orbits of 3I/ATLAS and nearby stars to search for stellar encounters. They have identified the gravitational influences of various stars, concluding that none of the identified encounters are plausible hosts due to high encounter speeds exceeding 20 km/s. The closest significant interaction with a binary system occurred about 1.64 million years ago.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The cumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction of 3I/ATLAS is weak,” the research team stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of interstellar objects have focused on their origins and interactions with stellar systems. Understanding the dynamics of these objects helps in determining their pathways through the galaxy and their potential sources.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research has been submitted for review and will undergo further evaluation. The findings may lead to additional studies on the dynamics of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>
