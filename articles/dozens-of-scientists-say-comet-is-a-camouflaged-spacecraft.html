      <h2>Dozens of scientists say comet is a ‘camouflaged spacecraft’</h2>

<p>On July 1, researchers discovered 31/Atlas, an interstellar object that some scientists now suspect may be a “camouflaged” spacecraft. A study signed by 20 scientists and astronomers indicates that the object, which has shown unusual behaviour, is moving at high speed and has changed colour from green to reddish glow, raising questions about its true nature.</p>

<p>This study matters because it challenges traditional views of comets and suggests the possibility of alien technosignatures. The international team of scientists has published their findings and noted that while 31/Atlas is likely a comet, they cannot rule out other hypotheses regarding its origin or function.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1</li>
    <li>Object speed: 130,000 mph</li>
    <li>Study signed by: 20 scientists</li>
    <li>Recent colour change: from green to reddish glow</li>
    <li>Location of observation: European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, scientists discovered 31/Atlas as an interstellar object. In the following weeks, the object exhibited a change in colour from green to reddish glow, prompting researchers to investigate its unusual behaviour. Earlier this month, scientists from the European Southern Observatory reported that the object had turned green again, indicating a possible activation of some process linked to its temperature.</p>

<p>Dr. Avi Loeb, a professor at Harvard University, has suggested that the behaviour of 31/Atlas is unlike any comet previously observed. He has stated that the quick colour change could be related to a temperature-activated process.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s definitely not a behaviour we observed before for any comet. I’m allowing myself the possibility that it’s a technological object,” said Dr. Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The ATLAS team interprets this anomalous evolution as a shift from scattering of sunlight by dust lifted from a reddened surface to the production of small, politically bright icy grains,” Dr. Loeb added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Imagine that you want to buy a ticket to see a show. As long as you have a small amount of money in your pocket, you will not get in, but once you have more than some minimum, you will be able to see the show,” explained Dr. Loeb regarding the threshold effect.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions about interstellar objects have often centred around their origins and potential for extraterrestrial life. The debate surrounding 31/Atlas follows similar conversations sparked by other interstellar phenomena, with scientists increasingly open to exploring non-traditional hypotheses.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 31/Atlas and analyze its behaviour as it approaches the Sun, looking for further evidence that could clarify its nature and origins.</p>
