      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Why Is Exocomet’s Anti-Tail Oriented Towards The Sun In New Hubble Images? Avi Loeb Decodes</h2>

<p>NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has captured new images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has been ejecting anti-tail jets towards the sun at an increased rate since its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS observatory in Chile. The object, known as an exocomet, is the third recorded interstellar object in the solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>These findings are significant as they challenge conventional comet behavior. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has identified at least 16 anomalies in 3I/ATLAS since its detection. The comet entered the Oort cloud approximately 8,000 years ago and is expected to exit the solar system shortly. It performed its perihelion on October 27 and will pass Earth at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units (AU) on December 19.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS observatory in Chile. It entered the Oort cloud around 8,000 years ago. The exocomet performed its perihelion on October 27, 2025. It will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 AU. A rendezvous with Jupiter’s irregular moon Eupheme is planned for March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb commented on the unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS, stating, "Usually, the elongated feature around comets is oriented away from the Sun. The physical reason is simple: the solar wind push on gas and the solar radiation push on dust create the appearance of a cometary tail extending away from the Sun relative to the nucleus."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further noted, "The anti-tail jet of 3I/ATLAS is one of its major anomalies, because it is clearly observed in post-perihelion images taken from different perspectives during the past couple of months."</blockquote>

<blockquote>He criticized NASA for not addressing the geometric anomalies during a press conference on November 19, 2025, stating, "Obviously, if one ignores the unexplained anomalies of 3I/ATLAS, one would conclude that there is nothing surprising about it."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed in our solar system. Prior observations of interstellar objects, such as 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have sparked debates about their origins and characteristics. The anomalies identified by Loeb suggest that there is still much to learn about these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of 3I/ATLAS is expected as it continues its journey through the solar system. Researchers will monitor its interaction with Jupiter’s moon Eupheme on March 16, 2026, and study the implications of its unusual anti-tail behavior.</p>
