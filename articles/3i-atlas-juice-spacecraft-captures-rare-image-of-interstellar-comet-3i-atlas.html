      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Juice Spacecraft Captures Rare Image of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) spacecraft has captured a significant image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels towards Jupiter. The image was taken on November 2, 2025, shortly after the comet's closest approach to the Sun. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, is believed to be at least 7 billion years old, nearly twice the age of the Sun.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS is one of only three interstellar objects detected in our solar system, providing a rare opportunity for scientific study. Due to the comet's brief visit, scientists have utilized existing spacecraft, including Juice and Mars orbiters, to gather data before it exits the solar system. The image shows the comet in an active state with a glowing halo of gas and two distinct tails, indicating substantial activity as the comet approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Image Capture Date:</strong> November 2, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Juice during image capture:</strong> 66 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Age of Comet:</strong> At least 7 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments used:</strong> JANUS, MAJIS, UVS, SWI, and PEP</li>
    <li><strong>Data arrival:</strong> Expected in February 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered. The comet, originating from outside the solar system, is believed to be around 7 billion years old. On November 2, 2025, Juice captured an image of the comet just two days before its closest approach. The spacecraft was positioned 66 million kilometres away from the comet at the time of the image capture. Following this, scientists began preparing to analyze the data, which is expected to arrive in February 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This image serves as an exciting preview of what’s to come from this unique cosmic encounter,” said a spokesperson from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three interstellar objects detected in our solar system, which underscores its importance for scientific research. The comet's brief visit has prompted the use of existing spacecraft to gather data, as a dedicated mission was not feasible.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists anticipate receiving the complete dataset in February 2026, which will include high-resolution images and detailed spectrometry data from Juice’s instruments. This data could provide insights into the composition of the ancient comet and its implications for understanding the chemistry of distant galaxies.</p>
