      <h2>Unverified 3I/ATLAS photo and Japanese video go viral - NASA's silence fuels misinformation on interstellar comet</h2>

<p>Images and videos claiming to show the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have gone viral on social media, with unverified content circulating since this week. The alleged images, purportedly released by NASA, and a video from Japanese scientists have attracted significant attention globally. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>The situation highlights concerns about misinformation as NASA has not officially commented on the authenticity of the images or videos. The lack of communication from the space agency has led to speculation and the spread of unverified claims about the object’s characteristics, with some suggesting it may resemble extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet generating significant global interest.</li>
    <li>Unverified images claimed to be from NASA show an elongated object resembling Oumuamua.</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>This week, images claiming to show 3I/ATLAS began circulating on social media, with many attributing them to NASA. The posts described the object as having an elongated shape and being surrounded by a bright cocoon of dust. Concurrently, a video purportedly from Japanese scientists emerged, further fueling excitement. NASA has remained silent on these claims, prompting speculation and concern about misinformation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA needs to step up and share everything it knows about 3I/ATLAS,” said an unnamed source, emphasizing the urgency for clear communication to prevent misinformation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The unusually symmetrical shape of the object has fascinated scientists,” according to a post accompanying one of the viral images.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
