      <h2>How Likely Are You to Be Abducted by Aliens?</h2>

<p>The Alien Abduction Odds Index 2026 from Canada Sports Betting has revealed that statistically, individuals in Kentucky have a higher chance of alien abductions compared to those in Tennessee, Illinois, or Indiana. The report indicates that Kentucky has a 1.07 percent implied probability of abduction, equivalent to 1 in 93 people, based on UFO reports logged from 2019 to 2024.</p>

<p>This index matters as it provides insight into the frequency of UFO sightings and abduction reports across North America. The findings are based on data from various sources, including the National UFO Reporting Center and Statistics Canada, and highlight that some regions consistently report more encounters than others.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Kentucky ranks 26th with a 1.07% implied probability of abduction.</li>
    <li>Indiana ranks 49th with a 0.4% implied probability of abduction.</li>
    <li>Kentucky logged 410 UFO reports and 29 reported abductions since 2019.</li>
    <li>Indiana has recorded zero reported abductions since 2019.</li>
    <li>New Hampshire has the highest rate of UFO reports at 24.34 per 100,000 residents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>From 2019 to 2024, the National UFO Reporting Center has tracked UFO sightings and abduction claims across the United States and Canada. The data shows a steady flow of reports rather than spikes during media attention. Kentucky's statistics reflect a consistent number of sightings, while Indiana's figures remain low regarding abduction claims.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This isn’t about predicting alien encounters. The implied probability is simply a way of showing where these kinds of reports tend to show up more often than elsewhere,” said an analyst at Canada Sports Betting.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Alien Abduction Odds Index highlights trends in UFO sightings across North America, showing that certain states, particularly in the Northeast and Northwest, report more encounters. The report suggests that while many people may never experience unusual events, specific regions are prone to such stories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor UFO reports and abduction claims. The data will be updated as new reports come in, allowing for ongoing analysis of trends and probabilities in different regions.</p>
