      <h2>NASA publishes findings on 3I/ATLAS and confirms the date when the mysterious interstellar object will approach Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has released its findings on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, confirming that it will approach Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet will be at a distance of 274 million kilometers from Earth, nearly twice the distance between Earth and the Sun. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it marks the first time NASA's heliophysics missions have deliberately observed an object from another solar system. The agency has utilized various spacecraft and observatories to gather data on 3I/ATLAS, providing insights into its trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 274 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA utilized several spacecraft, including Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN.</li>
    <li>Brightness of 3I/ATLAS increased enough to be visible to observers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope discovered the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, NASA initiated an unprecedented observing campaign to study the comet. Various missions, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, and others, were employed to track the comet's journey through the solar system.</p>

<p>NASA confirmed the date of the comet's closest approach to Earth on November 19, 2025, providing essential details about its trajectory and visibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA's spacecraft will continue to observe the comet as it journeys through the solar system,”</blockquote> the agency stated, highlighting the ongoing efforts to gather information on 3I/ATLAS.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS represents a significant milestone in space exploration, as it is only the third interstellar object to pass through our solar system. This event allows scientists to study the characteristics of objects originating from outside our solar system, enhancing our understanding of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, utilizing its spacecraft and observatories to gather further data leading up to the closest approach on December 19, 2025.</p>
