      <h2>Harvard Scientist Avi Loeb Claims 40% Chance 3I/ATLAS Is Alien Technology</h2>

<p>Since July 2025, the global scientific community has been studying the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was detected by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile. The comet is traveling at 58 km/s relative to the Sun and is the third known object of its kind to enter the Solar System. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to its discovery.</p>

<p>The comet's arrival has sparked intense debate among astronomers regarding the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. Authorities, including international space agencies and observatories, are currently conducting extensive analyses of the comet's composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units (203 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>Analysis has shown the presence of carbon dioxide, water ice, and carbon monoxide.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb estimates a 40% probability that 3I/ATLAS is a technological artefact.</li>
    <li>The Very Large Telescope confirmed the comet's nature in August 2025.</li>
    <li>Data from the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter improved trajectory predictions in October 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS telescope system in Chile detected comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet approached the Sun, reaching perihelion on October 29, 2025. Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope revealed its chemical composition, while the Very Large Telescope confirmed its cometary activity by capturing gas emissions in August 2025. In September 2025, NASA missions were redirected to gather additional data on the comet.</p>

<p>Professor Avi Loeb published an analysis in July 2025, proposing that eight anomalous features of the comet could suggest it is a technological artefact. This hypothesis has led to further examination of the comet's properties as scientists collect and analyze data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The combination of observed properties raises the question of whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural object or a technological artefact,” said Avi Loeb, who leads the analysis team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the first interstellar visitor, 1I/‘Oumuamua, which was identified in 2017. 1I/‘Oumuamua generated debate regarding its unusual characteristics, while the second interstellar object, 2I/Borisov, displayed typical cometary behaviour. 3I/ATLAS presents a unique case, exhibiting features that differ from both predecessors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>International agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as they collect more data. Investigators aim to clarify the comet's origin and composition, with results expected to emerge by 2030.</p>
