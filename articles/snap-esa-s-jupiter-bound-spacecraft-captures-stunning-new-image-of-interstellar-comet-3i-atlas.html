      <h2>Snap! ESA’s Jupiter-Bound Spacecraft Captures Stunning New Image of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) spacecraft has captured a new image of comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object detected in our Solar System, on 2 November 2025, from a distance of 66 million kilometres. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This image offers a unique opportunity for scientists as comet 3I/ATLAS makes its brief passage through the Solar System. It is one of only three interstellar objects ever detected, and researchers are racing to study it before it disappears. The Juice spacecraft, primarily designed to explore Jupiter’s icy moons, has turned its Navigation Camera (NavCam) toward the comet to contribute to the growing archive of observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is believed to have formed over 7 billion years ago.</li>
    <li>Juice captured the image on 2 November 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the comet was at a distance of 66 million km.</li>
    <li>The full dataset from Juice is expected to reach Earth in February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025. Due to the limited time frame, no dedicated mission was launched to study the comet. Instead, existing spacecraft, including NASA’s Mars orbiters and ESA’s Mars probes, began capturing images and data.</p>

<p>On 2 November 2025, Juice used its NavCam to capture an image of the comet just two days before its closest approach. The image shows the comet’s active state following its closest passage to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Although the NavCam is not a high-resolution science camera, the image still offers an impressive view of the comet’s dynamic activity,” ESA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of only three interstellar objects detected in the Solar System, providing scientists with a rare chance to study a celestial body that formed outside of our solar neighbourhood. The comet's age suggests it may offer insights into the early solar system and the conditions that existed when it was formed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As data transmission is currently slow due to Juice using its high-gain antenna as a heat shield, scientists anticipate receiving high-resolution images and spectrometry data by February 2026. This information will enhance understanding of the comet’s chemical composition and behaviour.</p>
