      <h2>Brightness increased and color changed: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS surprised scientists</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has surprised astronomers with a significant increase in brightness and a change in color, as confirmed on October 29, 2023, when it passed the perihelion of its orbit at a distance of 203 million km from the Sun. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This discovery is important for scientists studying interstellar objects, as it raises questions about the comet's behavior and composition. Authorities, including astronomers from various missions, are currently analyzing data and images captured by spacecraft to understand the reasons behind this sudden activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: 203 million km.</li>
    <li>Brightness increase rate doubled compared to earlier in 2023.</li>
    <li>Color changed from red to blue, indicating possible gas emissions.</li>
    <li>Observations made using SOHO, STEREO-A, and GOES-19 missions.</li>
    <li>Analysis published by astronomers Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams on arXiv.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion. This event prompted astronomers to observe the comet closely, revealing an unexpected surge in brightness and a color change.</p>

<p>In September and October 2025, astronomers reported that the comet displayed abnormal brightness levels, which were significantly higher than earlier observations in the year.</p>

<p>Data from spacecraft equipped with coronagraphs provided insights into the comet's behavior, leading to ongoing analysis by scientists to understand the changes observed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The increase in brightness may be caused by a massive release of gas from the comet, which managed to block the reflection of its dust,” said astronomers in their analysis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The blue color is characteristic of molecules such as C2 and NH2, which glow intensely when heated by the Sun,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation is significant as it contrasts with previous findings that indicated the dust of 3I/ATLAS was red. The unique composition of the comet, including higher levels of carbon dioxide and volatile ices, suggests it behaves differently from other comets in our Solar System.</p>

<p>The unusual activity of 3I/ATLAS may provide new insights into the nature of interstellar objects and their interactions with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists expect to gather more information about the comet's behavior in November 2023, when it is predicted to reappear in the Earth’s sky. This may allow for observations from smaller telescopes, in addition to powerful observatories.</p>
