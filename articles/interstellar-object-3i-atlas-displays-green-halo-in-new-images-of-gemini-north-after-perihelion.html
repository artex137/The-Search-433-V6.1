      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS displays green halo in new images of Gemini North after perihelion</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shown a green halo in images captured by the Gemini North telescope on November 26, 2025. This observation took place four weeks after the comet's perihelion on October 29, 2025, when it passed closest to the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the molecular composition of the comet and its behavior as it approaches the Sun. The Gemini North telescope, located at Maunakea, Hawaii, recorded the images during a public observation session. The green halo is thought to be linked to the emission of diatomic carbon (C2) molecules, indicating changes in the gas plume released by the object during its solar approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Post-perihelion images:</strong> November 26, 2025, at Gemini North</li>
    <li><strong>X-ray observation:</strong> December 3, 2025, by the XMM-Newton observatory</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 269 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Angular coincidence:</strong> Noted with gamma ray burst GRB 250702b detected on July 2, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile. It passed perihelion on October 29, 2025, coming closest to the Sun. Following this, images showing its green halo were captured by the Gemini North telescope on November 26, 2025. The XMM-Newton observatory conducted X-ray observations on December 3, 2025, confirming the presence of an extensive coma around the comet.</p>
<p>The object is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a safe distance of approximately 269 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The color transition from red to green indicates a variation in the molecular composition of the coma as the comet heated and released volatile materials,” said a representative from the Gemini North telescope.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the Solar System, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Its characteristics, such as its hyperbolic trajectory, suggest a different origin compared to local comets. The study of these interstellar visitors contributes to understanding planetary formation processes in other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues to move away from the Sun and approach Earth, it will remain observable by professional and amateur telescopes. Ongoing multiwave observations will provide further data on its chemical composition and behavior.</p>
