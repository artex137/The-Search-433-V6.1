      <h2>Japanese astronomer Mitsunori Tsumura obtains unprecedented record of comet 3I/ATLAS revealing straight tail and symmetric chioma</h2>

<p>Japanese astronomer <strong>Mitsunori Tsumura</strong> has captured an image of the interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> on November 22, 2025, using a 0.5-meter telescope. The observation reveals unique features, including a straight tail and a symmetric coma, which differ from typical comet characteristics. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it contributes to the understanding of celestial objects that traverse different star systems. Authorities, including NASA, are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics as part of a global effort to study interstellar objects. The findings may challenge existing knowledge of how comets behave in space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of observation:</strong> November 22, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope used:</strong> 0.5-meter telescope</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun during perihelion:</strong> 1.4 astronomical units</li>
    <li><strong>Core diameter estimate:</strong> up to 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Comet speed:</strong> 57 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Predicted distance in 2026:</strong> 53.445 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered by the ATLAS system in July 2025. Observations of the comet have been ongoing since May 2025, when it was detected at a distance of 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun. Tsumura's notable capture on November 22, 2025, has sparked increased interest in the comet's unique properties.</p>
<p>Following its perihelion passage in October 2025, additional studies have revealed a consistent emission pattern, challenging previous assumptions about comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This capture highlights the differences in composition and behavior of interstellar comets compared to those in our solar system,” said Tsumura.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The straightness of the tail and the uniformity of the coma suggest stable emission processes,” according to NASA officials.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing body of research on interstellar objects. Previous interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, have shown similar features, but 3I/ATLAS exhibits even greater linearity in its tail. This observation could reshape understanding of the physical properties of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches significant distances from the Sun. Ongoing studies aim to further investigate its composition and behavior, with updates expected from international astronomers and space agencies in the coming months.</p>
