      <h2>3I/ATLAS Alien Spacecraft or Interstellar Comet: Scientists and social media debate on anomalies, origins</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, first detected by the Deep Random Survey remote telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025, has sparked global debate regarding its origins and nature. NASA and astronomers confirm its interstellar origin, but unusual observations have led to speculation on social media about whether it is an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>This discussion has significant implications for the scientific community and public understanding of interstellar bodies. Authorities are continuing to analyze 3I/ATLAS, with NASA confirming its unique characteristics and monitoring its trajectory as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>NASA initially detected the object in May 2025, two months earlier than previously announced.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at a speed of 209,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is wrapped in a carbon dioxide fog and has a nucleus made of water ice.</li>
    <li>It will reach perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in May 2025 by NASA, which later confirmed its discovery through the ATLAS project in July 2025. Observations revealed that the comet's brightness increased five times instead of the expected 1.5 times, raising questions about its nature. In late October 2025, it is expected to reach perihelion, at which point scientists anticipate changes in its physical characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The composition is similar to comets in our solar system, suggesting 3I/ATLAS is a natural body,” said astronomer Carey Lisse from Johns Hopkins University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“SPHEREx detected high amounts of vaporized carbon dioxide around 3I/ATLAS but no carbon monoxide,” NASA reported.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time an interstellar object has drawn public attention. Previous objects, such as Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also led to speculation and theories about their origins. The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS continues to highlight public interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the nature of interstellar travel.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's SPHEREx team will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, with more data expected to be published in scientific journals. The ongoing analysis will help clarify the object's characteristics and confirm its classification as a comet.</p>
