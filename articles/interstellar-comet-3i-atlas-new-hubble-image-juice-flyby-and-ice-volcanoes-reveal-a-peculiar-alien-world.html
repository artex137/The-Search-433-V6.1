      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: New Hubble Image, JUICE Flyby and ‘Ice Volcanoes’ Reveal a Peculiar Alien World</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has generated significant scientific interest following new observations from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's (ESA) JUICE spacecraft. These findings were reported on December 5, 2025, revealing details about the comet's structure, including possible cryovolcano activity, as it travels through our Solar System.</p>

<p>The latest observations are crucial as they enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their behavior. Scientists are racing to study 3I/ATLAS before it departs the Solar System, as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet's unique characteristics may provide insights into the origins of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery: 1 July 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Interstellar origin: Identified by an orbital eccentricity greater than 1 and a speed of approximately 58 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Size: Estimated nucleus size between 0.3 and 5.6 km, likely under 1 km.</li>
    <li>Composition: Rich in carbon dioxide, with water ice, carbon monoxide, and other compounds detected.</li>
    <li>Trajectory: Passed closest to the Sun in late October 2025 and will approach Earth at a distance of 1.8 AU (269 million km) on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>Current brightness: Approximately magnitude 12, located in the constellation Virgo.</li>
    <li>Recent observations: Hubble captured new images on 30 November 2025, tracking the comet's movement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>1. **1 July 2025**: 3I/ATLAS is discovered by ATLAS in Chile.</p>
<p>2. **21 July 2025**: Hubble captures an initial image of the comet after its discovery.</p>
<p>3. **Late October 2025**: The comet reaches perihelion, passing closest to the Sun.</p>
<p>4. **30 November 2025**: Hubble takes a new image of 3I/ATLAS, revealing its characteristics.</p>
<p>5. **19 December 2025**: The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new image follows an earlier Hubble view, allowing astronomers to compare pre- and post-perihelion activity,” NASA stated in a blog post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb noted, “The teardrop-shaped glow contains a cloud of large, sunward-offset objects—potentially fragments, boulders, or something more exotic.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our Solar System. Its discovery has sparked debate among scientists regarding its composition and behavior, particularly with respect to its potential for cryovolcanic activity. The mainstream scientific community generally supports the view that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a typical comet, driven by solar heating, despite some speculative hypotheses regarding its origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As observations continue, scientists will analyze data from Hubble, JUICE, and other missions to clarify the comet's characteristics. Further imaging and spectroscopy are expected to provide more insights into the nature of 3I/ATLAS before it exits the Solar System.</p>
