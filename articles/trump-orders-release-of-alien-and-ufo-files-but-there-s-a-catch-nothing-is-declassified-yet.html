      <h2>Trump Orders Release of Alien and UFO Files, But There's a Catch: Nothing Is Declassified, Yet</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has directed the U.S. government to begin identifying and releasing records related to aliens and unidentified flying objects (UFOs) on Thursday, October 26, 2023. However, the directive does not explicitly order the declassification of any such records, raising questions about the actual impact of the announcement.</p>

<p>This development has sparked immediate excitement and speculation across social media, as many await potential disclosures about extraterrestrial life and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities have yet to clarify how this review-and-release process will unfold, and it remains to be seen whether any new information will become publicly available.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>President Trump issued a directive on Truth Social on October 26, 2023.</li>
    <li>The directive aims to identify and release government files related to aliens and UFOs.</li>
    <li>Trump has not ordered the explicit declassification of any records.</li>
    <li>Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has shared Trump's message on X (formerly Twitter).</li>
    <li>Trump's directive follows recent comments from former President Barack Obama regarding UAP.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 26, 2023, President Trump posted on Truth Social, directing the relevant departments and agencies to begin identifying and releasing records related to aliens and UFOs. His statement emphasized the need for a review process rather than outright declassification.</p>

<p>Earlier that month, former President Obama made headlines by discussing UAP, stating, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them.” He later clarified his remarks on Instagram, saying he saw no evidence of extraterrestrial contact during his presidency.</p>

<p>In a Q&A with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump framed Obama’s comments as a national security leak, suggesting he might “get him out of trouble by declassifying.”</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important matters. GOD BLESS AMERICA!” 
    <br><strong>— President Donald Trump</strong>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “That’s news to me.” 
    <br><strong>— Karoline Leavitt, White House spokesperson, on Lara Trump’s suggestion of a planned alien speech</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent surge in public interest regarding UAP has been fueled by years of congressional hearings, leaked military videos, and ongoing debates about government transparency. Trump’s directive comes amidst a backdrop of heightened discussion about extraterrestrial life, particularly following Obama’s comments.</p>

<p>Presidential authority over classification and declassification of information is significant, with the Supreme Court emphasizing the president's control over national security information. However, Trump's current directive lacks the explicit language needed to trigger immediate declassification.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The government will begin a review process to identify potential UFO-related files, but the timeline for any disclosures remains unclear. Investigations and further statements from Trump and relevant agencies may shape the future of this inquiry.</p>
