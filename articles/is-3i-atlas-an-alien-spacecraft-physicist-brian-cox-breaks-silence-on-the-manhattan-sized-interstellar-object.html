      <h2>Is 3I/Atlas an alien spacecraft? Physicist Brian Cox breaks silence on the Manhattan-sized interstellar object</h2>

<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered a mysterious object named 3I/Atlas streaking through the Solar System. The object, with an eccentricity exceeding 6, is confirmed to be interstellar, making it only the third such object found. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery has generated significant scientific interest and speculation online regarding the nature of 3I/Atlas, including theories suggesting it may be an alien probe. In response, physicist Brian Cox has provided a scientific perspective, emphasizing the importance of understanding the object in its natural context.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> Late October 2025, within 203 million kilometers (126 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Pass to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 270 million kilometers (168 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers wide</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Confirmed interstellar object</li>
    <li><strong>Tracking Agencies:</strong> NASA, ESA, and observatories worldwide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025. Early observations revealed a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust surrounding an icy nucleus. In late October 2025, it made its closest approach to the Sun, coming within 203 million kilometers (126 million miles). The comet is set to pass Earth at a safe distance on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>As it approaches, researchers plan to use instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and SPHEREx to analyze its elemental makeup.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/Atlas is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff. It is entirely natural in origin, its orbit is as expected, and it will whizz around the Sun and then disappear off into the galaxy again.”</blockquote>
<p>- Professor Brian Cox, in an interview with the BBC.</p>

<blockquote>“There’s an estimate a couple of days ago that it might have formed seven and a half billion years ago, so it was made before the Earth and the Sun had formed out of a cloud of dust.”</blockquote>
<p>- Professor Brian Cox</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas follows the identification of two previous interstellar objects, 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These findings provide researchers with rare opportunities to study materials formed outside our Solar System, enhancing our understanding of the cosmos.</p>

<p>Brian Cox's comments address the growing speculation about alien life and technology, reinforcing the idea that natural phenomena can inspire wonder without invoking extraterrestrial explanations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth, using advanced telescopes to decode its elemental makeup. This analysis may yield insights into the early chemistry of other planetary systems. Further observations are anticipated as the comet reappears in mid-November 2025.</p>
