      <h2>YouTube removes AI-generated 3I/ATLAS videos impersonating Harvard Professor Avi Loeb</h2>

<p>YouTube has removed a channel that published AI-generated videos impersonating Harvard Professor <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> and spreading misinformation about the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>. This action took place after Loeb directly communicated with YouTube representatives, highlighting the misleading content and its potential risks to public understanding of his work.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as it raises concerns about the use of AI in creating deceptive content that can misrepresent experts and their research. Loeb has consulted legal advisors at Harvard University regarding potential legal action against the creators of the fake channel.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>YouTube removed the channel following an email from Avi Loeb.</li>
    <li>The channel targeted Loeb's 10 million followers.</li>
    <li>Loeb reported receiving hundreds of emails from fans about the fake videos.</li>
    <li>The videos contained fabricated elements inconsistent with Loeb’s actual research.</li>
    <li>YouTube cited violations of community guidelines as the reason for removal.</li>
    <li>Loeb has not filed a formal lawsuit to date.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Over the past two weeks, Avi Loeb received numerous emails from fans about a YouTube channel using AI to create fake videos about 3I/ATLAS. In response, Loeb contacted YouTube directly, emphasizing the channel's misleading content. Following his email, YouTube removed the channel for violating its community guidelines and Terms of Service.</p>

<p>Loeb noted that the videos contained visual inconsistencies, such as a background clock frozen at a specific time and a lack of a facial injury he had sustained. After the removal, Loeb confirmed that a clip of the AI-generated content had been included in a previous news report, although the original videos are no longer accessible.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "In using AI to generate fake videos impersonating me, this YouTube channel violates several aspects of YouTube’s community guidelines and Terms of Service which should be the basis for YouTube to remove the channel."
