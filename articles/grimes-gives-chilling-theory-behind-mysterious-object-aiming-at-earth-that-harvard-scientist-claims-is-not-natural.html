      <h2>Grimes shares unusual theory on Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Grimes, the Canadian singer known as Claire Boucher, has proposed a theory regarding Comet 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may be a spacecraft rather than a natural celestial object. The comet was discovered earlier this year and is currently being monitored by astronomers, with observations set to begin on November 27, 2025, and continue for two months.</p>

<p>This theory has gained attention following comments from Harvard physicist Avi Loeb, who has noted anomalies in the comet's behavior. Authorities, including the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), have stated that while the comet poses no threat to Earth, it presents a significant opportunity for scientific observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2025.</li>
    <li>First sighting recorded in July 2025.</li>
    <li>IAWN has planned observations starting November 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb rates the comet a six on his scale of natural to technological objects.</li>
    <li>Grimes shared her theory on Twitter on November 29, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile. Following its discovery, the IAWN initiated plans to observe the comet, which are set to begin on November 27, 2025. On November 29, Grimes shared her theory on social media, suggesting that the comet may be on a mission to assess humanity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While it poses no threat, comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise," the IAWN stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Given the large-scale jets reported recently, the fact that 3I/ATLAS remains a single body is surprising for a natural comet,” Loeb wrote on his blog.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant because it is part of the eighth IAWN observing exercise since 2017, which occurs roughly once a year. Loeb's theory about the comet not breaking up after passing the Sun has sparked considerable interest and debate within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will continue its observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS over the next two months, while discussions regarding its nature and Grimes' theory are likely to continue among astronomers and the public.</p>
