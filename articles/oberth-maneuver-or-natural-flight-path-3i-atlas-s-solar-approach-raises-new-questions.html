      <h2>Oberth Maneuver or natural flight path? 3I/ATLAS’s solar approach raises new questions</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it has crossed an unusual path in our solar system, particularly during its solar conjunction behind the Sun on October 21, 2025. The object became invisible from Earth during this time and re-emerged near perihelion, approximately 203 million kilometers from the Sun, on October 29, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event has sparked debates among researchers regarding whether 3I/ATLAS’s movement is a natural flight path or a planned maneuver, specifically the Oberth Maneuver, which uses the Sun’s gravity to accelerate. Speculation has arisen online, with some suggesting the object could be an "alien mothership." Researchers are now investigating the object’s unusual characteristics to determine its origins and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Solar conjunction: October 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion: October 29, 2025, at 203 million kilometers from the Sun</li>
    <li>Confirmed by: Avi Loeb, via his blog on EurAsia Daily</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 21, 2025, 3I/ATLAS moved behind the Sun, becoming invisible from Earth. Eight days later, on October 29, it reached perihelion, drawing attention to its trajectory and potential movements.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb, a prominent scientist, has raised questions about whether the object is performing an Oberth Maneuver as it approaches the Sun. He noted that its trajectory aligns with the planets’ orbits and that its gas jets are directed towards the Sun, which are unusual characteristics for a comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated in his blog, "When will 3I/ATLAS reach the optimal time for Oberth maneuvers? Just eight days after joining the Sun."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further commented, "In this case, the Oberth maneuver can be applied to mini-probes that it launches at perihelion to the planets of the Solar system."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions surrounding interstellar objects have often included theories about extraterrestrial life. The "Wow! Signal," detected in 1977, has been a point of reference for researchers exploring signals from deep space. 3I/ATLAS’s trajectory and characteristics have reignited these discussions, particularly regarding the possibility of advanced technology or intelligence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue investigating 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its composition and trajectory as it exits the solar system. They aim to determine if its behavior aligns more closely with natural phenomena or engineered motion.</p>
