      <h2>Obama confirms existence of aliens during podcast interview</h2>

<p>Former US president Barack Obama has stated that aliens are real during a video interview on Saturday, October 28, 2023, on Brian Tyler Cohen's podcast. Obama clarified that while he believes in their existence, he has not personally encountered them.</p>

<p>This statement has reignited public interest in the topic of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities, including the federal government, have increased their efforts to investigate reports of UAPs, which are now taken more seriously following recent legislation and official inquiries.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interview Date: October 28, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Brian Tyler Cohen's podcast</li>
    <li>Obama's Position: 44th President of the United States</li>
    <li>Key Statement: "They're real, but I haven't seen them."</li>
    <li>Related Legislation: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act, passed in 2023</li>
    <li>New Agency: All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office established by the Department of War</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the podcast, Obama was asked about the existence of aliens. He responded affirmatively but noted he has not personally seen any. He also dismissed the idea that aliens are being held at Area 51, stating, "There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States."</p>

<p>Obama humorously recalled that his first question after taking office involved aliens, saying, "Uh, where are the aliens?" This is not the first time Obama has addressed the topic. In a 2021 appearance on "The Late Late Show with James Corden," he confirmed that he inquired about aliens but was told there was no evidence of them being studied in a secret lab.</p>

<p>Following Obama's comments, Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked President Joe Biden for his thoughts on the matter. Biden responded, "I would ask (Obama) again."</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are,” Obama said. “We can't explain how they moved, their trajectory. They did not have an easily explainable pattern.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UAPs has gained significant attention in recent years. The US government has begun to investigate these phenomena more seriously, leading to the establishment of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office and the passing of the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act in 2023. This shift reflects a growing willingness to address and study phenomena that remain unexplained.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAPs are expected to continue, with the federal government committed to transparency and further research on these unidentified phenomena.</p>
