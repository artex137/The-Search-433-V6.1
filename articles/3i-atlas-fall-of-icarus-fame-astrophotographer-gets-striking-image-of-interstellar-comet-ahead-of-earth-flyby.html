      <h2>3I/ATLAS: ‘Fall Of Icarus’ Fame Astrophotographer Gets Striking Image Of Interstellar Comet Ahead Of Earth Flyby</h2>

<p>Andrew McCarthy, an astrophotographer known for his “Fall of Icarus” portrait of the sun, has captured a striking image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS ahead of its closest approach to Earth on December 19. The comet will come within a distance of 1.79 astronomical units (AU), or approximately 270 million kilometers, from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to pass through the solar system. The comet's unusual behavior and features, particularly its anti-tail, have spurred discussion among scientists and the public. Authorities have noted that this close flyby presents a rare opportunity for both skygazers and scientists to observe the comet more closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>The distance at closest approach will be 1.79 AU (270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>McCarthy has shared his observations and images of the comet on social media.</li>
    <li>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has flagged 14 anomalies associated with the comet.</li>
    <li>The event coincides with a new moon, providing optimal viewing conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object and has since exhibited unusual behavior, including the presence of an anti-tail. On December 17, 2025, Andrew McCarthy shared his image of the comet on social media, highlighting its similarities to other comets he has photographed.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches Earth, McCarthy has addressed claims regarding its origin, stating it behaves like typical comets, sublimating ice from its surface and altering its velocity accordingly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is behaving very similarly to every other comet I've photographed in terms of changes of speed. Like any other, this comet is sublimating ice from its surface, which adds a small amount of thrust to impact its velocity over time.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What's weird about it that I can observe? The angle. Comets in the solar system come in at odd angles relative to the ecliptic plane, making them move in odd directions relative to their tail.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object documented to pass through the solar system, following 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov. The comet's behavior has raised questions about its origins and characteristics, drawing interest from both scientists and amateur astronomers alike.</p>
<p>The unusual features of 3I/ATLAS, such as its anti-tail, have prompted discussions regarding potential technological origins, though many experts maintain that its behavior is consistent with known cometary phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest flyby, astronomers and astrophotographers will continue to observe and document its trajectory and behavior to gain a better understanding of this interstellar object.</p>
