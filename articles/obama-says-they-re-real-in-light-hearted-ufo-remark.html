      <h2>Obama Says ‘They’re Real’ in Light-Hearted UFO Remark</h2>

<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama has made headlines after joking about aliens during a podcast interview on February 14, 2024. Speaking on the “No Lie with Brian Tyler Cohen” podcast, Obama addressed whether humans are alone in the universe, eliciting a mix of amusement and criticism online.</p>

<p>Obama’s comments have reignited discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and government transparency on the subject. His remarks come amid ongoing public interest in UFOs, particularly following recent revelations about UAP by various government agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of interview: February 14, 2024</li>
    <li>Podcast: No Lie with Brian Tyler Cohen</li>
    <li>Location of interview: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Obama's quote: "They’re real, but I haven’t seen them."</li>
    <li>Public reaction: Mixed, with humor praised and frustrations expressed by some UFO enthusiasts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2024, Barack Obama participated in a podcast where he was asked about the existence of extraterrestrial life. His response, which included a light-hearted remark about not having seen aliens, quickly gained traction on social media. The interview primarily focused on Democratic strategy for the upcoming 2028 election, but the alien question shifted the conversation's tone.</p>

<p>Obama has previously acknowledged that the U.S. government possesses footage of unexplained aerial objects, yet he has refrained from confirming any evidence of alien life. His latest statements, while made in jest, have stirred renewed public interest in UFOs and government knowledge of such phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them,” Obama said during the podcast, adding that alien discoveries were not part of the secrets he encountered upon entering the White House.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Obama's comments come at a time when interest in UAP has surged. Recent government disclosures have highlighted the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena, prompting calls for greater transparency. Despite acknowledging the existence of unexplained aerial objects, Obama has consistently avoided confirming any claims regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<pAs discussions about UAP continue, public interest is likely to remain high. Investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena by government agencies are ongoing, and additional disclosures may emerge in the coming months.</p>
