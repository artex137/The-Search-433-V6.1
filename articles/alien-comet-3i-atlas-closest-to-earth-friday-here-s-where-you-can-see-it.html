      <h2>Alien comet 3I/ATLAS closest to Earth Friday</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2025, reaching a distance of over 259 million kilometres. This event marks a significant opportunity for astronomers and skywatchers to observe the comet before it departs the solar system.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS is notable for both amateur and professional astronomers. Authorities, including the International Gemini Observatory and NASA, have been actively monitoring the comet's activity as it heats up and exhibits changes in its gas composition. This is a rare chance to witness a celestial visitor that will not return.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Closest approach of comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Over 259 million km from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Peak brightness:</strong> Approximately magnitude +10 in early November, currently around magnitude +11</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Requires a telescope with at least a 6-inch aperture</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers first identified comet 3I/ATLAS nearly five months ago. Initial observations revealed a red hue, which has since shifted to a greenish glow as gases evaporate due to solar heating. On November 26, 2025, the Gemini North telescope captured images showcasing this colour change.</p>

<p>On November 30, 2025, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope also imaged the comet, providing further insights into its structure. Observations will continue as the comet approaches its perihelion and begins to move away from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Many comets have a delayed reaction in experiencing the Sun's heat due to the lag in time that it takes for heat to make its way through the interior of the comet,” said NOIRLab in a recent press release. “A delay can activate the evaporation of new chemicals or trigger a comet outburst.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the first time 3I/ATLAS has been visible from Earth since its discovery. Comets generally display increased activity after their closest approach to the Sun, making this an exciting period for observational astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away from Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its gas composition and any potential outbursts. The comet is expected to transition from the constellation Leo to Cancer by the end of January 2026, depending on its brightness.</p>
