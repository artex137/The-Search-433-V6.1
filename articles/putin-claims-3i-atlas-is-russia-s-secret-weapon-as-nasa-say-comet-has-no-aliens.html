      <h2>Putin claims 3I/ATLAS is 'Russia's secret weapon' as NASA says comet has 'no aliens'</h2>

<p>Russian President <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> has claimed that <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, a celestial object approaching Earth, is "Russia's secret weapon" during a press conference on <strong>December 19</strong> at the World Trade Centre in Moscow. The object, which has been observed in our solar system over the past year, made its closest approach to Earth last week.</p>

<p>This announcement has raised eyebrows, particularly as NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, describing it as a comet. The implications of Putin's remarks come amid rising tensions in space policy and exploration, with various experts weighing in on the nature and origin of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS approached Earth on December 19, 2023, at approximately 6 a.m. (UK time).</li>
    <li>The object traveled at around 153,000 mph, roughly 210 million km from Earth.</li>
    <li>Putin's press conference was attended by over 1,300 journalists.</li>
    <li>NASA has described 3I/ATLAS as the third confirmed object from outside our solar system.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to exit our solar system by early 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>October-November 2023:</strong> 3I/ATLAS disappears behind the Sun and is not observable.</p>
<p><strong>December 2023:</strong> The object reappears and approaches Earth, prompting renewed interest from astrophysicists.</p>
<p><strong>December 19, 2023:</strong> Putin makes his controversial remark at a press conference, later clarifying that the object does not pose a threat.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I will let you in on something, but it must stay between us because it's classified information. This is our secret weapon, but we will only use it as a last resort,” Putin said, drawing laughter from attendees.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It's a comet, and it doesn't pose a threat to Earth,” he added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA scientist <strong>Tom Statler</strong> stated, “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following <strong>'Oumuamua</strong> in 2017 and <strong>2I/Borisov</strong> in 2019. The object has sparked debate among scientists regarding its composition and potential for containing alien life, with some experts, like controversial astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>, suggesting it could hold mysteries yet to be uncovered.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory, scientists will monitor its path and study its properties. NASA maintains that all evidence points towards it being a natural comet, while discussions around its implications for space policy and exploration are likely to continue.</p>
