      <h2>Study evaluates the alignment of 3I/ATLAS closest approach with Jupiter’s Hill sphere</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is projected to reach its closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, at a minimum distance of 53.445 million kilometers, according to NASA’s JPL Horizons code. The calculations, based on data from approximately 230 observatories, indicate that this distance closely aligns with Jupiter’s Hill radius of 53.502 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This alignment is significant as it highlights the gravitational interaction between 3I/ATLAS and Jupiter. The findings could influence the understanding of orbital dynamics and the potential capture of objects by Jupiter's gravity. Observations from spacecraft like Juno may provide insights into any new orbiters resulting from this encounter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach date: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Minimum distance from Jupiter: 53.445 (+/- 0.06) million kilometers</li>
    <li>Jupiter’s Hill radius: 53.502 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Relative speed of 3I/ATLAS at closest approach: 65.9 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Orbital data collected from approximately 230 observatories</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The study's calculations have been derived using NASA’s JPL Horizons code, which has incorporated non-gravitational accelerations observed during 3I/ATLAS’s perihelion passage. The adjustments made to the predicted distance during this month-long event have brought the minimum distance closer to the Hill radius.</p>

<p>Steve Fairfax has noted the near coincidence of the minimum distance and Hill radius in communication with Harvard Professor Avi Loeb, emphasizing the importance of this statistical alignment.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The proximity of Min{D} to the Hill radius has implications for potential capture of objects within Jupiter’s gravitational influence,” said Steve Fairfax.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The alignment of the minimum distance and Hill radius is considered a statistical coincidence, with a margin of 0.06 million kilometers. This margin corresponds to one part in 1,000 relative to the Hill radius and one part in 26,000 relative to Jupiter’s full orbital diameter around the Sun.</p>

<p>This study adds to the list of major anomalies of 3I/ATLAS, as outlined by Professor Avi Loeb, which includes its nucleus mass, trajectory, and observed jets documented in recent reports.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further monitoring of 3I/ATLAS’s trajectory is expected, along with potential detection of any new material influenced by Jupiter’s gravity during the object's closest approach.</p>
