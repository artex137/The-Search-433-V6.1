      <h2>Eerie moment UFO spotted rising out of the sea in Suffolk before zipping off</h2>

<p>A UFO has been reported rising out of the sea off the coast of Suffolk, England, in a sighting captured on video by a private investigator. The incident occurred during a night of surveillance in 2020, but the footage has attracted renewed attention following the release of a new programme on UFOs.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it adds to the ongoing discourse about UFO sightings in the UK, a country noted for its high number of reported incidents. Authorities, including the Ministry of Defence, have historically downplayed concerns over UFO activity, but ufologists argue that government files indicate a deeper interest in the phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred during a night of surveillance in 2020.</li>
    <li>Footage shows an object rising from the sea and traveling six miles in 90 seconds.</li>
    <li>Estimated speed of the object was about 240 km/h.</li>
    <li>Private investigator Paul Sinclair has filmed similar objects on three occasions.</li>
    <li>New UFO programme titled "Ancient Aliens Britain’s UFO Files" is available on Sky History platforms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2020, private investigator Paul Sinclair and his team conducted surveillance along the clifftops of Yorkshire, where they observed an unidentified object rise from the North Sea. The entire sequence lasted approximately 90 seconds, during which the object reportedly covered a distance of six miles.</p>

<p>Following this incident, Sinclair captured footage of the object, which has been described as luminous and capable of moving rapidly. This sighting has contributed to ongoing discussions about UFOs in the UK.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We have footage of objects beneath the surface of the water. Or luminous light beneath the surface. And we’ve no explanation for that.” 
    <br>- Paul Sinclair, private investigator
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The UK has a long history of UFO sightings, with reports dating back over 80 years. The Ministry of Defence released 60,000 files on UFOs in 2008, revealing that military personnel have encountered unidentified objects on multiple occasions. Notably, the Rendlesham Forest incident in 1980 remains one of the most discussed cases involving military witnesses.</p>

<p>Despite numerous sightings, the government has maintained a stance of indifference towards UFO reports, leading ufologists to suggest that there may still be undisclosed information regarding these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the sightings continue as ufologists and researchers seek to understand the nature of these occurrences. The release of new documentaries may further fuel public interest and scrutiny regarding UFO activity in the UK.</p>
