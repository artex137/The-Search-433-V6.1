      <h2>NASA warning as rare comet heading for Earth is 'unusually active'</h2>

<p>NASA has issued a warning that a rare comet, named 3I/ATLAS, is "unusually active" as it approaches Earth. The comet was first spotted by researchers in early July 2023, although it had been visible on other telescopes as early as May.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it indicates that comets from other solar systems may have different compositions than those in our own solar system. NASA and other researchers are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and brightness changes, which are attributed to the emission of "hypervolatile" materials such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>It was visible on telescopes as early as May 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is being tracked by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).</li>
    <li>Researchers used a technique called "shift-stacking" to analyze its trajectory.</li>
    <li>The comet emits hypervolatile materials, indicating a different composition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2023, telescopes detected the presence of comet 3I/ATLAS. By early July, researchers confirmed its activity. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) played a critical role in observing the comet, capturing images every 200 seconds. Researchers employed "shift-stacking" to track the comet's movement accurately.</p>

<p>In October 2022, another rare comet, C/2023 A3 Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, was noted for its brightness and visibility, marking a significant event for comet observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The increased brightness of the comet has led to speculation about its nature, but our data indicates it is emitting hypervolatile materials,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In December 2022, astronomer Daichi Fuji captured an object striking the moon, raising questions about its identity. This incident, along with the recent activity of 3I/ATLAS, highlights the ongoing interest and research into celestial objects and their impacts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, focusing on its trajectory and emission patterns. Further observations and analyses are expected to provide more insights into the characteristics of this interstellar visitor.</p>
