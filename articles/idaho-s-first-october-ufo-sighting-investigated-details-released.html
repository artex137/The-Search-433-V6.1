      <h2>Idaho's First October UFO Sighting Investigated, Details Released</h2>

<p>The National UFO Reporting Center has investigated a reported sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) near Caldwell, Idaho, that occurred on October 4 at approximately 5 A.M. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this sighting.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it adds to a growing list of UAP reports in southern Idaho, a region known for its high number of sightings, which some attribute to the proximity of Mountain Home Air Force Base. Authorities are currently reviewing the details of the incident and have encouraged any witnesses to come forward.</p>
