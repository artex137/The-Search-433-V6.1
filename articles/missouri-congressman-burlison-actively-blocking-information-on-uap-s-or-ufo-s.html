      <h2>Missouri Congressman Burlison ‘actively blocking’ information on UAPs, or UFOs</h2>

<p>Southwest Missouri Congressman <strong>Eric Burlison</strong> has accused the federal government of “actively blocking” information related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), commonly known as UFOs. Burlison made these remarks during a U.S. House Oversight Committee meeting last week, where he presented a video showing a military drone attempting to shoot down a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen last year.</p>

<p>This situation highlights ongoing concerns about transparency and accountability in governmental oversight of UAP information. Authorities are under pressure to provide clarity regarding UAP incidents and any potential implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: U.S. House Oversight Committee meeting</li>
    <li>Date: Last week, specific date not disclosed</li>
    <li>Location: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Video presented: Military drone shooting at an orb off Yemen</li>
    <li>Witness: Dylan Boreland, Air Force veteran</li>
    <li>Company mentioned: BAE Systems, based in London</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the recent U.S. House Oversight Committee meeting, Congressman Burlison presented video evidence of a military drone incident. He questioned Air Force veteran Dylan Boreland about potential evidence of extraterrestrial technology. This follows previous hearings where Burlison expressed skepticism about the origins of UAPs, suggesting they could be manmade or possibly of non-human origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Look, I (have) not jumped to the conclusion that I believe that there are, you know, aliens coming from another planet. But I’m open to that,” Burlison said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Boreland responded, “We’re going to have to have a conversation for that, whether I’m legally even allowed to answer that and whether you’re even allowed to hear it, sir.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Following a separate congressional hearing in 2023, Burlison stated, “In my opinion I think it’s either angels or it’s manmade,” and “I think the most likely explanation is that it’s manmade.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UAPs have become a focal point in national discussions about airspace security and governmental transparency. Past incidents involving military encounters with UAPs have raised questions about the nature of these phenomena and the government's knowledge about them. Congressional hearings have increasingly addressed these concerns, reflecting a shift towards greater public interest and scrutiny.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP incidents are expected to continue, with further congressional hearings likely to focus on the implications of Burlison's claims regarding governmental transparency.</p>
