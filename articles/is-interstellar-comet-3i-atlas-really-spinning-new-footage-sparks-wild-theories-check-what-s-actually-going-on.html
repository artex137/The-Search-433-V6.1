      <h2>Is Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Really Spinning? New Footage Sparks Wild Theories</h2>

<p>New images and videos of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have surfaced, generating excitement and speculation among astronomy enthusiasts and social media users. The footage, shared widely across various platforms, suggests the comet may be spinning. However, none of these claims have been scientifically verified.</p>

<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS matters because it is a rare interstellar visitor, currently traveling through our Solar System for the first and only time. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are monitoring the comet closely. They are expected to release official images and findings soon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at over 210,000 km/h, too fast for the Sun’s gravity to capture it.</li>
    <li>The comet’s closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Visibility is low on the eastern horizon before dawn, requiring at least an 8-inch telescope to see.</li>
    <li>It will pass closest to Mars at a distance of 29 million km on October 2-3, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The speculation about 3I/ATLAS began when amateur astronomers shared footage that appeared to show rotational motion around the comet. Key posts included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>November 18, 2025: A video from Rays Astrophotography showed what some claimed was a spinning structure.</li>
    <li>November 19, 2025: Another post highlighted a video shared at 9 PM EST that included images of 3I/ATLAS, coinciding with an upcoming NASA live event.</li>
    <li>November 21, 2025: Footage from Diego San Araujo compared the comet's motion to a prior ESA capture, suggesting possible rotation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The viral images have sparked worldwide curiosity, making this interstellar visitor one of the most talked-about space objects of 2025,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant for scientific study because it may contain high levels of carbon dioxide, indicating it formed in a very cold part of a distant star system. Its unique interstellar nature means it will not return, making this a one-time observational opportunity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA’s JUICE spacecraft will continue observing 3I/ATLAS until November 25, 2025, with detailed data expected in 2026. NASA is also set to release new images and analysis soon, which may clarify whether the spinning effects observed online are real or just imaging artefacts.</p>
