      <h2>Potentially hostile alien threat 3I/ATLAS makes strange change as it nears Earth</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS, described as a potentially hostile alien threat, has exhibited a significant colour change as it approaches Earth. Theoretical physicist Avi Loeb has been monitoring the comet, which is the third interstellar object discovered passing through our solar system, according to NASA. The change has raised questions about its molecular composition.</p>

<p>This development is notable because it has prompted discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence. Loeb has shared his observations in a blog post, highlighting that the comet's glowing halo has shifted from red to green, potentially indicating a change in the gases being emitted. Authorities and scientists are closely observing the object as it continues its trajectory towards Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered in our solar system.</li>
    <li>Theoretical physicist Avi Loeb has been studying the comet's unusual features.</li>
    <li>The comet changed from a red glow to a green glow as it neared the Sun.</li>
    <li>The change is possibly due to diatomic carbon (C2) molecules emitting green light.</li>
    <li>A gamma-ray burst was observed in July, coinciding with the comet's discovery.</li>
    <li>The peak brightness is centered on the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025, coinciding with a gamma-ray burst. On September 4, 2025, a pre-perihelion image showed the comet glowing red. As the comet reached its perihelion, a post-perihelion image displayed a green glow, suggesting a change in the gas emissions.</p>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb noted, "The color of the glowing halo appears green, possibly as a result of diatomic carbon (C2) molecules which emit green light."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's observations add to the ongoing debate about the existence of extraterrestrial life. The comet's unusual characteristics have sparked interest among scientists and the public alike, prompting further investigation into its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, examining its molecular composition and any further changes in its emissions. The findings may provide additional insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
