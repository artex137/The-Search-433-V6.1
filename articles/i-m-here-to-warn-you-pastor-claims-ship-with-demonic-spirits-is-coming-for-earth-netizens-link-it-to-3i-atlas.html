      <h2>'I'm here to warn you' - Pastor claims 'ship with demonic spirits' is coming for Earth</h2>

<p>An American pastor has claimed that a ship with "demonic spirits" is approaching Earth, sparking widespread attention on social media. Brandon Biggs, who previously predicted an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, shared his vision in a YouTube video, stating that the ship is flying over the Vatican and Mayan temples in Mexico. The timing of his revelation coincides with the approach of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is currently on a trajectory towards the Sun.</p>

<p>This claim has raised concerns among some netizens, who have linked Biggs' prediction to 3I/ATLAS, an object identified by scientists as potentially having an unnatural origin. Authorities, including scientists and astronomers, are monitoring the object as it nears its closest approach to the Sun, scheduled for October 29-30.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Brandon Biggs made his claims in a YouTube video.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is predicted to reach perihelion on October 29-30, 2023.</li>
    <li>Biggs had previously predicted an assassination attempt on Donald Trump three months prior to the incident.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS last flew by Mars on October 2-3, 2023.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to Earth in mid-December 2023.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft will observe 3I/ATLAS in November 2023.</li>
    <li>The NASA Juno spacecraft is set to observe it in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, Brandon Biggs claimed to see "little bitty ships" emerging from the "mother ship." He expressed uncertainty about the nature of these ships but indicated they could be related to extraterrestrial phenomena.</p>
<p>On October 2-3, 2023, 3I/ATLAS flew by Mars, drawing attention from the scientific community.</p>
<p>On October 29-30, 2023, 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun, where scientists will observe its behavior closely.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “A major distraction is about to take place. I said, 'Lord, are there two of these?' And he said, 'No, it's just one',” said Biggs in his video.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There are going to be things in the sky that are going to scare everybody in the days ahead,” Biggs added, referring to the anticipated arrival of the ship.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Brandon Biggs has gained notoriety for his prophetic claims, particularly regarding political events. His prediction about Trump's assassination attempt gained traction after it partially came true, leading some to take his latest statements seriously. Scientists have also expressed concerns about 3I/ATLAS, with Harvard scientist Avi Loeb suggesting it may be a piece of alien technology rather than a natural comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and Earth. Observations from various spacecraft, including the JUICE and Juno missions, are planned for the coming months, with data expected to shed light on the object's origins and behavior.</p>
