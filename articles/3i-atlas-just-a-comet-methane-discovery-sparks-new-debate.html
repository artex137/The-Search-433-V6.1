      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Just a Comet? Methane Discovery Sparks New Debate</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, has drawn significant attention from astronomers following new observations from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes. Recent data showing unexpected methane outgassing has intensified discussions about the object's nature and origins.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it challenges existing cometary models and raises questions about the formation of celestial bodies in distant stellar systems. Astronomers are now investigating the implications of the findings and monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Diameter of 3I/ATLAS: Approximately 2.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Methane production rates: 13.7% and 27% of water production rate</li>
    <li>Post-perihelion observations: December 15–16 and 27, 2025</li>
    <li>Confirmed as interstellar: Shortly after detection</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors: 1I/'Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. After its discovery, the object was confirmed as interstellar and became a focus of scientific study. On October 29, 2025, it made its closest approach to the Sun. Following this event, Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes conducted observations, leading to the discovery of methane outgassing.</p>
<p>On December 15–16 and 27, 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope conducted spectroscopic analysis, revealing the presence of methane along with other compounds. In August 2025, earlier observations had failed to detect methane, suggesting a delayed onset of its outgassing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, a senior NASA official, stated, “The object is not indicative of alien life or technology,” emphasizing the need for evidence-based conclusions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb noted the methane anomaly as part of a pattern of peculiarities, suggesting that “the accumulating anomalies warrant consideration of alternative hypotheses.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Physicist Brian Cox described 3I/ATLAS as a “completely natural object” and dismissed claims of extraterrestrial technology as unsubstantiated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unusual chemical composition, particularly a high carbon dioxide to water ratio, has prompted speculation about its origins, indicating it may have formed in a much older stellar environment.</p>
<p>The detection of methane, a hyper-volatile compound, raises questions regarding the object's surface composition and potential changes as it neared the Sun. Previous studies of comets have not indicated such delayed outgassing behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it recedes from the Sun. Further observations may provide additional insights into its composition and help resolve ongoing debates about its nature and origins.</p>
