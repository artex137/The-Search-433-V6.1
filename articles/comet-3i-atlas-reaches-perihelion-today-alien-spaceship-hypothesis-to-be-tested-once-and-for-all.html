      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-29 15:32 UTC</p>

      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Reaches Perihelion Today – “Alien Spaceship” Hypothesis To Be Tested Once And For All</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its perihelion today, July 1, 2023, marking its closest approach to the Sun at a distance of 203 million kilometers (126 million miles). This event is significant as it provides an opportunity to test the claims made by astronomer Avi Loeb regarding the comet's potential artificial nature.</p>

<p>This examination is crucial as it could settle ongoing debates about the comet's origin. Authorities, including scientists from the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, have consistently rejected the idea that 3I/ATLAS is anything but a natural comet. They are monitoring the comet's trajectory to confirm its behavior aligns with predictions for a typical comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Today marks its perihelion, 203 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to become visible again before dawn in the coming days.</li>
    <li>The ESA's JUICE mission will observe the comet from deep space on Sunday.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has made claims about the comet’s potential as an alien spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Scientists estimate there are 10,000 interstellar objects within Neptune’s orbit daily.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered, becoming the third known interstellar object. Since its detection, astronomer Avi Loeb has raised questions about its nature, suggesting it may be an alien spacecraft. Today, the comet has reached perihelion, the point where it is closest to the Sun.</p>
<p>Following this, the comet is expected to continue on its trajectory away from the Sun, becoming less visible to observers on Earth. The ESA's JUICE mission will begin its observations shortly after perihelion to gather data on the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If you want to take a vacation, take it before [October 29], because who knows what will happen?” – Avi Loeb
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “What it actually is is probably more interesting than what we can imagine it to be because it's like a time capsule from a different era.” – Colin Wilson, European Space Agency Project Scientist for ExoMars and Mars Express
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, Avi Loeb has made similar claims about other interstellar objects, including 1I/’Oumuamua. His assertions regarding the nature of these objects have often been met with skepticism from the scientific community. The ESA and NASA maintain that there is no evidence supporting the idea that 3I/ATLAS is anything other than a natural comet.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS is noted for its peculiarities, such as an anti-tail, but experts assert that these features do not indicate artificial origins. The comet is believed to be older than the Solar System, adding to its scientific significance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The observations by the ESA’s JUICE mission will be critical in determining whether 3I/ATLAS behaves as a typical comet. If it follows expected patterns, the hypothesis of it being an alien spacecraft will likely be dismissed.</p>
