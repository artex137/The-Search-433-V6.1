      <h2>Pilot reports UFO hovering beside jet, leaving air traffic control stunned</h2>

<p>The pilot of a private jet has reported seeing a small, silver cylinder hovering near his aircraft while flying at 3,500 feet over Rhode Island on December 22, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the incident.</p>

<p>This sighting has raised questions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and has captured the attention of both aviation authorities and the public. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that it documents UAP sightings whenever pilots report them to air traffic control.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: December 22, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport</li>
    <li>Aircraft type: Piper PA-32RT-300T Turbo Lance II</li>
    <li>Altitude: 3,500 feet</li>
    <li>Object description: Small silver cylinder</li>
    <li>FAA response: Reports UAP sightings and collaborates with UAP Task Force</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 22, 2025, the pilot of a Piper PA-32RT-300T Turbo Lance II reported to air traffic control a small silver cylinder hovering near the right wing of his aircraft. The pilot described the object as appearing to be “standing still” and noted that there was “nothing attached to it.” The object later flew alongside the aircraft before disappearing from view.</p>
<p>Air traffic control informed the pilot that there were no other reports of an object in the area and suggested it might be a drone or balloon. The pilot expressed astonishment at the sighting, prompting an ATC staff member to joke, “Good luck with the aliens.” Other pilots in the area also responded to the radio transmission, with one stating, “I want to believe him.”</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The FAA documents UAP sightings whenever a pilot reports one to an air traffic control facility,” the FAA said in a statement. “If supporting information such as radar data corroborates the report, the FAA shares it with the UAP Task Force.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Multiple U.S. government agencies have individual programs or processes to study and document UAP. However, the agencies also work collaboratively on the topic,” the FAA added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a growing trend of UAP sightings reported by pilots and civilians. Recent testimonies before Congress have highlighted concerns regarding UAP encounters and their implications for aviation safety and national security. The FAA has been increasingly involved in documenting and investigating these reports.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to investigate the sighting, and the FAA will assess any supporting data related to the incident. The outcomes of the investigation may influence future protocols regarding UAP reporting and documentation.</p>
