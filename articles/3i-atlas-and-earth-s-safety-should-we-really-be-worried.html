      <h2>3I/ATLAS and Earth’s safety: Should we really be worried?</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object nearing the Sun and Earth, poses no collision threat as it approaches its closest point to Earth on 19 December 2025. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>Scientists worldwide are monitoring 3I/ATLAS to study its unique features and improve space safety. The comet is only the third known comet to enter the solar system from outside the Sun, making it a significant object of study for astronomers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, at a distance of about 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 270 million km).</li>
    <li>Closest point to the Sun expected around 29-30 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet will pass between Earth and Mars during its closest approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA and other agencies are closely monitoring the comet's path.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on 1 July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile. Since then, its trajectory has been tracked by telescopes worldwide, including ESA’s Mars orbiters and NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun around 29-30 October 2025 and will come closest to Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every potential threat to Earth from space objects is closely monitored by NASA and other agencies,” said a NASA spokesperson regarding the safety of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While the comet is safe, scientists have noticed unusual behaviour,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, suggesting a possible non-natural origin. However, NASA experts confirm the comet is a natural object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study material from outside our solar system. This research can yield new insights into the formation of stars and planets beyond our cosmic neighbourhood. Previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, have also sparked scientific interest and speculation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and Earth. The data collected during this time will help improve comet tracking methods for future space safety initiatives.</p>
