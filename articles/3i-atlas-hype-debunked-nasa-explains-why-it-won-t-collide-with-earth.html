      <h2>3I/ATLAS Hype Debunked—NASA Explains Why It Won't Collide With Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is currently passing through our solar system and will not collide with Earth, according to NASA. The comet is expected to maintain a safe distance of approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometres) from our planet during its closest approach on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks only the third confirmed interstellar object, providing a unique opportunity for scientists to study material from beyond our solar system. NASA has mobilized various observatories and missions to gather data on 3I/ATLAS before it travels back into deep space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is passing through our solar system.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest approach to Earth at about 1.8 astronomical units (au) or 170 million miles (270 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>NASA's ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, discovered the comet on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet on July 21, 2025, when it was 277 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet's estimated diameter ranges between 440 metres (1,444 feet) and 5.6 kilometres (3.5 miles).</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to the Sun around October 30, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2025, astronomers made pre-discovery observations of 3I/ATLAS using multiple telescopes, including those from the ATLAS network and Caltech’s Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory. The official discovery was reported to the Minor Planet Centre on July 1, 2025. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet on July 21, 2025. The comet will reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS will not collide with Earth. Its journey through our solar system is a fleeting but profound event,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system, following 1I/2017 U1 and 2I/Borisov. The study of such objects offers valuable insights into the materials and conditions of other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS using various observatories and missions, including the Hubble and Webb space telescopes. The comet will remain observable from Earth until September 2025, after which it will be obscured by the Sun's glare.</p>
