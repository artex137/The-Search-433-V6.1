      <h2>CIA responds to inquiries about comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The CIA has responded to inquiries regarding the comet 3I/ATLAS, stating they can "neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records" related to the object. This statement follows a freedom of information request made by UFO researcher John Greenewald Jr. The CIA's response has sparked discussions about the nature of the comet and its implications for potential extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it has reignited public interest in claims that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien reconnaissance craft. While NASA has classified the comet as a natural object, scientists like Harvard physicist Avi Loeb continue to speculate about its origins and significance. The CIA's vague response has led to further debate about government transparency regarding unidentified phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First Sighted:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Agency Involved:</strong> CIA</li>
    <li><strong>Requestor:</strong> John Greenewald Jr.</li>
    <li><strong>Date of CIA Response:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's Position:</strong> Comet is natural in origin</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS is first observed, quickly becoming a topic of speculation concerning its possible origins.</p>
<p>Throughout late 2025, discussions about the comet escalate, with some suggesting it may be an alien craft. This speculation is met with rebuttals from NASA, which affirms the comet's natural origin.</p>
<p>On January 7, 2026, the CIA responds to a freedom of information request from John Greenewald Jr., stating their inability to confirm or deny the existence of records related to 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The fact of the existence or non-existence of such records is itself currently and properly classified." - CIA statement
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "This is a wise policy for mitigating societal unrest or instability of financial markets at a time when the reality of a black swan event is still regarded as highly unlikely." - Avi Loeb
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CIA's use of the "neither confirm nor deny" response, known as the Glomar response, originates from the agency's need to protect sensitive information. This response has been employed in various situations to avoid revealing details that could pose a national security threat.</p>
<p>Previous incidents involving unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) have led to increased scrutiny of government agencies and their transparency regarding potential extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will likely continue to monitor public interest and scientific research related to 3I/ATLAS. Further investigations or disclosures from government agencies may arise as the topic remains relevant in discussions about space exploration and unidentified objects.</p>
