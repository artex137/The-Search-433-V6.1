      <h2>High-speed rail funds</h2>

<p>A comet known as 3I/ATLAS is approaching the sun, providing a rare opportunity for scientists to study an interstellar object as it moves through our solar system. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the sun by late October 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS offers scientists a unique chance to observe an object from outside the solar system. The University of California, Santa Cruz (UC Santa Cruz) has initiated a program called Shadow the Scientists, which allows the public to engage with astronomers in real-time as they study the comet. This program aims to demystify scientific research and provide accurate information to counteract speculation regarding the comet's origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by NASA in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object passing through the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the sun by late October 2023.</li>
    <li>Upcoming public sessions on 3I/ATLAS will take place on September 25 and in late November 2023.</li>
    <li>The program Shadow the Scientists was started in 2020 at UC Santa Cruz.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, NASA discovered comet 3I/ATLAS, marking it as an interstellar visitor. As it approaches the sun, its material will begin to vaporize, allowing scientists to study its composition and gather valuable data. The Shadow the Scientists program has organized sessions for the public to learn more about the comet, with the first session scheduled for September 25, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Could this be something that aliens — another civilization — sent to us? That has been starting a conversation,” said Jameeka Marshall at UC Santa Cruz.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This kind of sensationalism ends up ultimately... causing people to lose faith in more serious, evidence-based research and science,” said Raja GuhaThakurta, faculty director of UC Santa Cruz's department of Creating Equity in STEAM.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar object identified within our solar system. The phenomenon of interstellar comets has captured public imagination, leading to various theories about their origins. Programs like Shadow the Scientists aim to provide clarity and promote interest in scientific inquiry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS approaches the sun, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition. The Shadow the Scientists program will hold sessions to educate the public further about the comet and its implications for astronomy.</p>
