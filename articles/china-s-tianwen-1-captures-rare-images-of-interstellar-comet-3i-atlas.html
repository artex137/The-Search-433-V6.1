      <h2>China’s Tianwen-1 captures rare images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>China’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft has captured images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS between October 1 and 4, 2023, as it orbits Mars. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) reported that this achievement marks a significant development in the study of this unusual celestial object.</p>

<p>The images have sparked renewed interest in 3I/ATLAS, which is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. The successful imaging by Tianwen-1 comes amid calls for NASA to release its own data on ATLAS, which has not yet been disclosed. This situation raises questions about transparency in scientific research and access to valuable astronomical data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tianwen-1 has been orbiting Mars since 2021.</li>
    <li>The images were captured during a narrow observation window from October 1 to 4, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object following ‘Oumuamua and comet Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibited unexpected acceleration, noted by NASA on October 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>Representative Anna Paulina Luna has urged NASA to release its unreleased data on ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 2023, 3I/ATLAS disappeared from Earth-based telescopes as it moved behind the sun. During this time, capturing images of the comet became a priority for deep-space probes.</p>

<p>On October 1 to 4, 2023, Tianwen-1 successfully captured images of ATLAS, including an animated GIF showing the comet moving past Mars. NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reportedly captured its own image of ATLAS on October 2, but has yet to release it.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Withholding data slows scientific progress on a once-in-a-generation event,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, praising calls for NASA to release its findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS stems from its unusual behavior, including shifting colors and non-gravitational acceleration. These characteristics have led some scientists to question whether it behaves like a standard comet. Previous interstellar objects like ‘Oumuamua and Borisov have also drawn significant attention from researchers.</p>

<p>As ATLAS becomes visible from Earth again later this month, astronomers are preparing for a new wave of observations, with heightened expectations for further insights into its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>CNSA teams are conducting deeper analyses of the data obtained from Tianwen-1 to refine estimates of 3I/ATLAS’s size, behavior, and origin. As the comet comes back into view, pressure mounts on NASA to release its own findings related to this extraordinary object.</p>
