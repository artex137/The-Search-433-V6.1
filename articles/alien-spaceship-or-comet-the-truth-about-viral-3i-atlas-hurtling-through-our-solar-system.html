      <h2>Alien Spaceship Or Comet? The Truth About Viral 3I/ATLAS Hurtling Through Our Solar System</h2>

<p>New Delhi: Rumours on social media have circulated about a massive comet, identified as 3I/ATLAS, heading towards Earth. The object was detected by NASA’s ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025. Claims of an existential threat have emerged, alongside suggestions for military actions to intercept it. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>Authorities have clarified that 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet, which poses no danger to Earth. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have confirmed that it will pass at a safe distance, providing a rare opportunity for scientific study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on July 21, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometres (167.8 million miles).</li>
    <li>Will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, around 210 million km (130.5 million miles).</li>
    <li>Moves at roughly 210,000 km/h (130,500 mph), the fastest speed recorded for an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Nucleus size ranges from 440 m to 5.6 km in diameter.</li>
    <li>No evidence supports claims of military intervention or alien technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA's ATLAS telescope detected the interstellar object now known as 3I/ATLAS. It made its closest approach to Earth on July 21, 2025. As news of the comet spread, social media users began to speculate about its nature, with many claiming it could be an alien spacecraft. By September 29, 2025, a New York Post article fueled further speculation, leading to widespread viral posts about military responses and possible threats. The ESA and NASA have since confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no danger to Earth and is an opportunity for scientific research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS doesn’t pose a threat to Earth, but it does provide NASA scientists and spacecraft with a rare opportunity to study an interstellar comet as it passes through our solar system,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet remains more than 2.5 times the distance between Earth and the Sun,” an ESA spokesperson stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous incidents involving viral misinformation about celestial events have led to public concern. In this case, social media has amplified false narratives about 3I/ATLAS, linking it to military actions and alien technology without evidence. NASA and ESA have routinely addressed similar misconceptions to reassure the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, utilizing data from the Hubble Space Telescope to study the comet further. No investigations or charges are pending regarding the spread of misinformation.</p>
