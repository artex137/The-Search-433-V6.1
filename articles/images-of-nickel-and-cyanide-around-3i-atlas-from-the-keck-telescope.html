      <h2>Images of Nickel and Cyanide Around 3I/ATLAS from the Keck Telescope</h2>

<p>A new study has reported findings from the Keck II telescope in Hawaii regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, observed on August 24, 2025. The comet was located approximately 2.75 astronomical units from the Sun and 2.6 astronomical units from Earth at the time of observation.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it provides new insights into the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS, which exhibits unusual characteristics compared to known comets. The data could contribute to a better understanding of the object and its origins, according to the authors of the study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: August 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: 2.75 AU</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 2.6 AU</li>
    <li>Telescope used: Keck II telescope, Hawaii</li>
    <li>Emission wavelengths studied: 0.3425 to 0.55 micrometers</li>
    <li>Key findings: Nickel emissions detected, no iron present</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of 3I/ATLAS, which was analyzed in subsequent studies. The recent observations from the Keck II telescope on August 24 revealed further anomalies in the comet's emissions, particularly the presence of nickel.</p>

<p>The authors of the new paper suggest that the nickel detected may originate from a natural carbonyl process occurring near the comet's nucleus. The study indicates that this phenomenon is unusual, as similar nickel emissions have only been documented in industrial settings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This in-situ formation of Ni(CO)4 predicts that nickel should be strongly concentrated near the nucleus,” the authors stated in their findings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The production rate of nickel relative to cyanide is higher than in 2I/Borisov and orders of magnitude above the solar system comet median,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has previously been classified as an outlier among comets due to a series of anomalies observed in past studies. This includes its unique emission profiles and the absence of a typical cometary tail. The study adds to the growing body of evidence that distinguishes 3I/ATLAS from more familiar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further data on 3I/ATLAS is expected from the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which will provide images on October 2, 2025. Additional observations from the Juice spacecraft are anticipated in November 2025, followed by data from the Juno spacecraft in March 2026. These upcoming releases may offer more clarity on the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
