      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS makes closest pass of Earth</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has flown past Earth, making its closest approach at approximately 1 a.m. EST on December 19, 2023, coming within about <strong>168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</strong> of our planet. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is a rare interstellar object from outside our solar system, being only the third interstellar visitor ever detected. Astronomers are gathering data on the comet while it remains observable in the pre-dawn sky until spring, according to NASA.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach occurred at 1 a.m. EST on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth was approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Comet size is estimated to be between 1,440 feet (440 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide.</li>
    <li>Next closest approach will be to Jupiter on March 15, 2026, at about <strong>33 million miles (54 million kilometers)</strong>.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It will cross the orbits of Saturn in July 2026, Uranus in April 2027, and Neptune in March 2028.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2023, when astronomers spotted it moving at around <strong>137,000 mph (221,000 km/h)</strong> within Jupiter's orbit. After swinging past the sun and reaching its closest point to the sun at the end of October, it approached Earth on December 19, 2023. Following its passage, the comet is expected to continue toward Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is worth checking out because it's a rare example of an interstellar object from outside of our solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is noted for its potential to be the oldest comet ever seen. Its origins remain uncertain, with scientists unable to determine which star system it came from. The comet has garnered attention due to speculation surrounding its nature, although most astronomers believe it is a comet rather than an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Observations will focus on its properties and trajectory, with particular attention on its upcoming approach to Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
