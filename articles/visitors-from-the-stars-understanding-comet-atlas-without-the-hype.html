      <h2>Visitors from the Stars: Understanding Comet ATLAS Without the Hype</h2>

<p>NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered Comet 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025, marking it as the third known interstellar object detected, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this discovery.</p>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS presents a significant scientific opportunity as it allows astronomers to study material from another star system. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates that it is not bound to the Sun, and it will make its closest approach to the Sun in late October 2025, just inside the orbit of Mars. This event offers a rare chance to examine its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Third known interstellar object detected.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun expected in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has a hyperbolic orbit.</li>
    <li>First detected signs of a coma rich in carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>Expected to re-emerge in December 2025 after passing behind the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA’s ATLAS telescope discovered Comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet was identified as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic trajectory. As it approaches the Sun, it begins to warm up, releasing gas and dust, and revealing a coma rich in carbon dioxide. The comet is expected to make its closest pass to the Sun in late October 2025 and will re-emerge in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a time capsule from another star system. Its study can reveal the chemistry of distant stellar nurseries,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The simplest explanation is that it’s a comet, not a spaceship. There are no signs of technology or engineered features,” noted an astronomer involved in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of earlier interstellar objects like ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have sparked interest in the potential for studying materials from outside our solar system. Each new discovery enhances our understanding of the formation of celestial bodies and the chemical diversity in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, astronomers will continue to monitor its activity and prepare for its closest pass in late October 2025, followed by further observations in December 2025.</p>
