      <h2>JUICE Spacecraft Captures 3I/ATLAS During A Narrow Window of Cometary Activity</h2>

<p>In early November 2025, the European Space Agency's JUICE mission briefly recorded interstellar object 3I/ATLAS while en route to Jupiter, at a distance of approximately 66 million kilometers. The observation occurred as the comet emerged from solar conjunction and shortly after perihelion, a time when cometary activity is expected.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides independent verification of 3I/ATLAS's active state, confirming that the object was releasing material at that moment. The JUICE spacecraft's findings contribute to ongoing research into the characteristics and behavior of interstellar objects, which have previously presented limited observational windows for study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: Early November 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 66 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Spacecraft: JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer)</li>
    <li>Observation method: Onboard Navigation Camera (NavCam)</li>
    <li>Confirmed activity: Presence of a visible coma and two distinct tail components</li>
    <li>Data delivery expected: Mid-February 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2025, JUICE recorded the image of 3I/ATLAS as it emerged from solar conjunction. This moment marked a critical point when the object was confirmed to be actively releasing material. The JUICE spacecraft, while primarily designed for navigation, provided an essential observation during a period when other observatories faced limitations due to solar glare and communication delays.</p>

<p>The JUICE mission's findings will enhance the understanding of 3I/ATLAS's behavior, moving from isolated snapshots to a more coherent physical profile, as additional data arrives in early 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The JUICE observation does not test those hypotheses directly, but it provides structural context that will be essential when higher-resolution and multi-wavelength data are fully analyzed,” researchers noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects have offered limited observational opportunities, complicating the study of their activity over time. The observations of 3I/ATLAS have been notable for being captured by both ground-based telescopes and space assets, providing a broader understanding of the object’s behavior.</p>

<p>Research has suggested that 3I/ATLAS displays chemical ratios that differ from typical Solar System comets, which may indicate its formation in a different stellar environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As JUICE continues its mission, the arrival of additional scientific data in February 2026 will allow scientists to further analyze the morphology, composition, and particle environment of 3I/ATLAS, enhancing the study of this active interstellar object.</p>
