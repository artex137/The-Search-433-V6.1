      <h2>Scientists are monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS after a sudden increase in brightness and an intense blue color that defies known explanations, says Harvard professor</h2>

<p>Scientists are closely monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited a sudden increase in brightness and an unusual blue coloration. The observations were made by various solar observation spacecraft as the comet approached the Sun in September and October 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet’s activity.</p>

<p>This unusual behavior matters because it challenges existing models of cometary activity. Researchers are analyzing the comet's photometry to understand its characteristics, as the intensity and color suggest complex gaseous emissions or physical properties not yet understood. Instruments on board the STEREO-A, SOHO, and GOES-19 have recorded significant changes in the comet's brightness, prompting a global scientific investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Period:</strong> September and October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments Used:</strong> STEREO-A, SOHO, GOES-19</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Color:</strong> Intense blue</li>
    <li><strong>Research Lead:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li><strong>Next Visibility:</strong> Expected to emerge brighter after solar conjunction</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. As it approached the Sun, scientists noted an increase in brightness and a striking blue hue not typically seen in comets. Throughout September and October 2025, multiple solar observation spacecraft detected abrupt changes in the comet's photometry.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb, a researcher from Harvard University, highlighted the surprising nature of the blue coloration, which contradicts the expected reddish tones of dust-covered celestial bodies. The scientific community is currently analyzing this data to determine the implications for our understanding of cometary behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The blue hue of 3I/ATLAS is very surprising. Celestial bodies covered in dust tend to reflect reddish tones, so this behavior defies the thermal and spectral expectations of cometary physics."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This behavior of 3I/ATLAS is not typical for comets, as they usually reflect light in different spectra based on their surface conditions. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have prompted scientists to consider whether current theories of comet formation require revision. The comet's trajectory is also notably aligned with the orbital plane of the planets, further complicating its classification.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away from the solar region, scientists expect to conduct continuous analysis in the coming weeks. New measurements will help determine the nature of the comet's brightness and color, which could lead to significant developments in the study of interstellar objects.</p>
