      <h2>Barack Obama reveals aliens are 'real' as he addresses Area 51 conspiracy in stunning interview</h2>

<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama has confirmed the existence of aliens during an interview on the No Lie podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen, stating, “They’re real,” although he added, “But I haven’t seen them.” The interview took place recently, where Obama also addressed conspiracy theories regarding Area 51, a classified U.S. Air Force facility in Nevada.</p>

<p>This revelation comes as public interest in UFOs and potential extraterrestrial life has surged in recent years. Authorities have not disclosed any current investigations into UFO sightings or government involvement. The discussion surrounding Area 51 continues to fuel speculation about government secrecy and the existence of alien life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interview conducted on the No Lie podcast.</li>
    <li>Obama confirmed aliens exist but has not seen them himself.</li>
    <li>Area 51 is a highly classified military facility in Nevada.</li>
    <li>Area 51 was first opened in 1955 and acknowledged by the CIA in August 2013.</li>
    <li>Obama became the first U.S. president to publicly mention Area 51.</li>
    <li>In 2023, Duane "Keefe D" Davis was charged with the murder of Tupac Shakur.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the interview, Obama revealed his curiosity about extraterrestrial life when he became president. He humorously recounted, “What was the first question you wanted answered when you became president? Where are the aliens?”</p>

<p>Area 51 has been a focal point for conspiracy theories since its establishment during the Cold War. The CIA only confirmed its existence in 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act request. Obama publicly acknowledged Area 51 for the first time during the Kennedy Center Honors shortly after the CIA's disclosure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re not being kept in Area 51. There’s no underground facility — unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States,” Obama said regarding alien life.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“He’s alive on my playlist,” Obama joked when asked about the conspiracy theories surrounding the rapper Tupac Shakur.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has long attracted the attention of conspiracy theorists, who speculate about the government’s secrecy regarding UFOs and aliens. The facility's operations remain largely undisclosed, with public access restricted by armed security and surveillance. The interest in UFOs has intensified, especially following recent government reports on unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>In addition to discussing aliens, Obama addressed the ongoing speculation surrounding Tupac Shakur's death, which has been a topic of intrigue since the rapper was murdered in 1996. Recent developments include the arrest of Duane "Keefe D" Davis, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for further investigations into UFO sightings or Area 51. The legal proceedings regarding Tupac Shakur's murder will continue as Duane "Keefe D" Davis maintains his innocence. Further updates on both topics are anticipated as public interest remains high.</p>
