      <h2>'Potentially hostile alien object' shows new strange behaviour just hours before closest-ever pass to Earth</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its closest point to Earth on 19 December 2025, just hours after exhibiting unusual behaviour, according to physicist Avi Loeb. The comet, which was discovered in July, is expected to pass approximately 170 million miles away from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory. Authorities, including NASA and astronomers, are closely monitoring the comet's behaviour, which has sparked speculation about its origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 170 million miles (273 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Current speed: 130,000 miles per hour (209,214 kilometres per hour)</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Notable features: anti-tail, unusual trajectory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. Since then, it has been under observation due to its peculiar features. In October 2025, the comet passed the Sun and has since accelerated to its current speed. On 18 December 2025, just hours before its closest approach, it exhibited strange behaviours that have drawn attention from scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The trajectory may have been planned," highlighting the comet's alignment with the solar system's planets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also mentioned a "periodic wobble" detected from jets in the comet's nucleus, arguing that it has a low probability of occurring by chance.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This isn't the first time an interstellar object has raised eyebrows. Previous incidents have included the observation of Oumuamua in 2017, which also prompted speculation about its origins. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretation of such objects, with some advocating for further investigation into their nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its behaviour and trajectory. The comet's passage offers a unique opportunity for further study, with findings potentially impacting our understanding of similar celestial objects.</p>
