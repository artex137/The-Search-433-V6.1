      <h2>Ohioans have 1.13% chance of being abducted by aliens, study finds</h2>

<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) -- A report from Canada Sports Betting (CSB) has revealed that Ohioans have a 1.13% chance of being abducted by aliens, with over 4,000 abduction reports recorded since 2019. The state ranks 21st in the nation for alien abduction odds, according to the study, which examined data from 2019 to 2024.</p>

<p>This report highlights the frequency of alien abduction claims in Ohio, prompting interest from researchers and authorities. CSB analysts noted that while Ohio does not rank among the top 20 states for abduction odds, it has shown consistent reporting patterns across various regions, including cities and rural areas.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ohio has a reported alien abduction for every 11,300 residents.</li>
    <li>The state has recorded over 4,000 abduction reports since 2019.</li>
    <li>Ohio ranks 21st in the nation for alien abduction odds.</li>
    <li>The total population of Ohio is just under 12 million people.</li>
    <li>NASA launched a study of unidentified anomalous phenomena in 2022.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to the CSB report, the analysis of alien abduction statistics has been ongoing from 2019 to 2024. The study has drawn attention to the consistent occurrence of reports in Ohio, despite the state not being among the top 20 for abduction odds.</p>

<p>In January 2023, the National UFO Reporting Center registered three UFO sightings in Ohio, but none were classified as abduction reports. Notably, on January 22, two individuals in Toledo reported seeing an "orange fireball like UAP in the sky." The other reports lacked explanations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“People assume these reports are random,” a CSB analyst said. “But when you map them out, the same states keep showing up — which says more about reporting patterns than anything else.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Ohio has historical connections to UFO phenomena. A declassified National Security Agency document from 2021 detailed the Air Force's investigations into unidentified flying objects under "Project Blue Book" at Wright Patterson Air Force Base from 1947 to 1969. The project concluded there was no evidence of UFOs posing security threats or links to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Additionally, other declassified documents indicate that the French government has explored various UFO cases, with 10 out of 11 cases deemed inexplicable by natural or human means.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and researchers will continue to analyze the data on UFO sightings and abduction reports in Ohio, while NASA's study on unidentified anomalous phenomena is ongoing, seeking to gather more high-quality observations to draw definitive conclusions.</p>
