      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: Calls grow for NASA to release MRO images of interstellar comet</h2>

<p>NASA is facing increasing pressure to release data on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which flew by Mars on October 2-3, 2023. The comet is only the third interstellar object observed in our solar system, following Oumuamua and Borisov. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The controversy centers on the lack of information from NASA regarding 3I/ATLAS, which scientists and officials say is crucial for understanding the comet's nature and its interaction with our solar system. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has criticized NASA's silence, stating that withholding information means losing a battle against time. He has called for the release of data to enable further studies before the comet leaves the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object observed in the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet flew by Mars on October 2-3, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA has released one image of 3I/ATLAS, provided by the European Space Agency.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Perseverance rover and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter observed the comet.</li>
    <li>Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna sent a letter to NASA on October 31, urging the release of data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2-3, 2023, 3I/ATLAS made a close flyby of Mars. Both the Perseverance rover and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reportedly observed the comet during this time. However, NASA has not disclosed any data from these observations.</p>

<p>On October 31, 2023, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna sent a letter to Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy, requesting the urgent release of data related to 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,"</blockquote> said Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna in her letter to NASA.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS highlights ongoing concerns about NASA's transparency regarding interstellar objects. Previous incidents involving the release of data on Oumuamua and Borisov have raised questions about the agency's policies on information sharing.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS becomes increasingly visible from Earth, the demand for data has intensified, with speculation surrounding unverified images and videos claiming to depict the comet circulating online.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to face continued pressure from lawmakers and the scientific community to release data on 3I/ATLAS. The agency's next steps regarding the sharing of information remain undisclosed.</p>
