      <h2>Harvard astrophysicist remains skeptical on 3I/ATLAS despite NASA images</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has expressed skepticism about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, even after NASA released new images on Wednesday. Loeb stated that he does not believe the object is “just a comet,” according to reports from News.Az.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which NASA has described as an unusually large and atypical comet. NASA officials assert that the new images provide valuable data, but Loeb argues that they reveal little beyond the object's outer composition. He anticipates that more definitive answers may emerge when 3I/ATLAS reaches its closest approach to Earth on December 19, approximately 170 million miles away.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a Harvard astrophysicist.</li>
    <li>NASA released new images of 3I/ATLAS on Wednesday.</li>
    <li>Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien vessel.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>The object is approximately 170 million miles away at that point.</li>
    <li>Loeb's colleague, Michio Kaku, estimates the object is 7 billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA released new images of 3I/ATLAS on Wednesday. Following this, Avi Loeb voiced his skepticism regarding the object's classification as a comet. He highlighted several unexplained anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, including its size and chemical signatures.</p>

<p>Loeb anticipates that more data will be available by December 19, when the object is expected to be at its closest point to Earth. He believes that this influx of data could clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Let’s wait and see… Bureaucrats or unimaginative scientists want us to believe in the expected, but the rest of us know the best is yet to come,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I would say by Dec. 19 we would have enough data. There would be a flood of data that would tell us what this object is,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Over 7 billion years, it’s had plenty of time to accumulate different gases, different elements, different kinds of environments that it goes into,” stated Michio Kaku.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around 3I/ATLAS highlights ongoing debates within the scientific community about the classification of interstellar objects. Loeb's perspective challenges conventional views, suggesting that some objects may hold more complex origins than previously thought.</p>

<p>Previous studies of interstellar objects have also raised questions about their composition and history, but 3I/ATLAS's unique characteristics have sparked particular interest among researchers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, scientists will continue to analyze the data. They expect that the information gathered around December 19 will provide clearer insights into the object's nature and composition.</p>
