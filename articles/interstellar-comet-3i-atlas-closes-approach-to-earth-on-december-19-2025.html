      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS closes approach to Earth on December 19, 2025</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, coming within approximately 270 million kilometers of the planet. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>This astronomical occurrence is significant as it offers scientists a rare opportunity to study materials and processes that may have influenced the formation of planetary systems. Authorities, including the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, are currently monitoring the comet’s trajectory and characteristics through various missions and telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS observation system in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>The comet's relative speed is 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>It reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Hubble Space Telescope observed the comet on November 30, 2025, when it was 286 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
    <li>Amateur astronomers have been able to observe the comet since November 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's core is estimated to have a diameter between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet has emitted gas and dust at varying speeds, with small particles ejected at 22 meters per second.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered using the ATLAS telescope in Hawaii. Subsequent observations confirmed its active nature, including the presence of a coma and tail. On October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, and on November 30, detailed observations were made using the Hubble Space Telescope. The comet is scheduled to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, before continuing its journey through interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of this object offers a unique opportunity to study materials and processes that may have influenced the formation of other planetary systems,” said David Rankin from Saguaro Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet, distinguished by its hyperbolic orbit and high speed of 58 km/s. Previous interstellar comets have revealed insights into the composition and behavior of such celestial bodies, contributing to our understanding of cosmic evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its approach on December 19, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS will continue to travel through interstellar space, with ongoing observations expected to enhance knowledge of its composition and characteristics.</p>
