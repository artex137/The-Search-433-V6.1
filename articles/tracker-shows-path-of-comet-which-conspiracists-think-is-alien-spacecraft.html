      <h2>Tracker shows path of comet which conspiracists think is 'alien spacecraft'</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar object, is currently traveling through our solar system and is set to pass its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025. The comet poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA, and will continue its trajectory back into deep space after its closest approach.</p>

<p>This comet has sparked interest among both scientists and conspiracy theorists. Some believe it could represent alien technology, while NASA has confirmed its natural origin. Dr. Avi Loeb, director of Harvard University’s Institute for Theory & Computation, has suggested that the comet warrants closer examination, though he acknowledges the likelihood of it being a natural object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide.</li>
    <li>It passed Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will approach Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA confirms it will not come closer than 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles or 270 million kilometers) to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified during the summer of 2025. It passed Mars on October 3 and is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30. Following this, it will approach Jupiter in March 2026 before moving back into deep space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, approaching no closer than about 1.8 astronomical units,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This situation is starkly different from detecting a radio signal from a civilization located thousands of light years away,” said Dr. Avi Loeb. “If an interstellar object is a functional device on a near Earth trajectory, then the visitor is already in our backyard and we have little time to respond.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is not the first interstellar object to be observed. However, it has generated significant discussion due to its speed and trajectory. The scientific community has studied previous interstellar objects, but the potential for Comet 3I/ATLAS to be a technological artifact has prompted renewed interest in the subject.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion and will provide updates on its trajectory. Further observations are anticipated once it reappears from behind the Sun in early December 2025.</p>
