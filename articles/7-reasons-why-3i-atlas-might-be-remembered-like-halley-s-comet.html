      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Makes Rare Visit to Our Solar System</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, a rare visitor from beyond our solar system, has entered the solar system at speeds of approximately 137,000 miles per hour (about 210,000 kilometres per hour) and is currently visible from Earth. This comet, which is only the third known to originate from outside the solar system, has sparked significant interest among scientists and astronomy enthusiasts worldwide.</p>

<p>This event matters because it provides a unique opportunity for scientific study of materials from the early universe. Authorities, including space agencies across the globe, have mobilized to observe and analyze the comet's trajectory and composition, enhancing our understanding of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is moving at about 137,000 miles per hour (210,000 kilometres per hour).</li>
    <li>It is only the third known comet to come from outside our solar system.</li>
    <li>Scientists believe it could be up to 14 billion years old.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is less than 1 km wide.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS contains unusual chemicals such as carbon dioxide and nickel gas.</li>
    <li>Space agencies worldwide are observing 3I/ATLAS using telescopes and probes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has made its entrance into the solar system, moving along a hyperbolic path that confirms it will only pass through once. The comet is expected to provide valuable insights into the materials that formed early stars and planetary systems.</p>
<p>As it travels through our solar system, various space agencies have begun coordinating their efforts to track its movement, utilizing both Earth-based telescopes and space probes near Mars and Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This rare visitor gives scientists a unique chance to study material from far beyond our home,” said an unnamed astronomer involved in the research.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The unique blend of speed, age, and chemistry means we may never see a comet quite like this again,” noted a spokesperson from a leading space agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Unlike Halley’s Comet, which returns to the inner solar system every 76 years, 3I/ATLAS is not bound by the Sun's gravity and will not return. Its composition includes elements not common in typical solar system comets, making it a significant subject of study for understanding the formation of planets and stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue as it travels through the solar system, with scientists eager to analyze the data collected. This research could enhance our understanding of the origins of comets and the early universe.</p>
