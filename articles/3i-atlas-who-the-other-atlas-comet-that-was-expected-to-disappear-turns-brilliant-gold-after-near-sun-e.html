      <h2>3I/ATLAS Who? The ‘Other ATLAS’ Comet That Was Expected to Disappear Turns Brilliant Gold After Near-Sun Encounter</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered a new comet, C/2025 K1 (ATLAS), which has surprised scientists by surviving a close encounter with the Sun and transforming into a brilliant golden color. The comet reached its perihelion on October 8, coming within 50 million kilometers of the Sun. This unexpected survival has captivated skywatchers and researchers alike, according to a report by Live Science.</p>

<p>The significance of C/2025 K1's transformation lies in its challenge to existing theories about comet fragility. Its survival during such a close approach to the Sun raises questions about the structural integrity of comets. Observatories are now closely monitoring the comet, analyzing its dust composition and behavior following its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered in May 2025 by the ATLAS observatory network.</li>
    <li>It reached its closest point to the Sun on October 8, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet came within 50 million kilometers (about 31 million miles) of the Sun.</li>
    <li>New images taken on October 29 show the comet displaying a golden hue.</li>
    <li>It is currently visible between the constellations Virgo and Leo, best seen shortly before sunrise.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on November 25, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>May 2025: C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is discovered by the ATLAS observatory network.</p>
<p>October 8, 2025: The comet reaches its perihelion, coming close to the Sun.</p>
<p>October 29, 2025: New images reveal the comet's unexpected golden color, coinciding with 3I/ATLAS’s perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet was not supposed to survive its Oct. 8 perihelion,” said astrophotographer Dan Bartlett. “But it did survive, and now it is displaying a red-brown-golden color rarely seen in comets.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>David Schleicher from the Lowell Observatory noted, “Only two other known comets have shown such a low level of carbon compounds.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unexpected behavior of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) adds to the ongoing study of comets and their interactions with solar forces. Typically, comets disintegrate when they approach the Sun, making this event noteworthy for astronomers. The situation also parallels the ongoing interest in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which continues to intrigue researchers worldwide.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze telescope data to understand the dust composition and behavior of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS). The comet's visibility will remain until early December, providing a unique opportunity for observations alongside 3I/ATLAS.</p>
