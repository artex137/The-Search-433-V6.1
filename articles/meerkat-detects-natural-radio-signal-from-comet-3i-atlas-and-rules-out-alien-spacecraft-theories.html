      <h2>MeerKAT detects natural radio signal from comet 3I/Atlas and rules out alien spacecraft theories</h2>

<p>Astronomers at the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa have recorded the first natural radio signal from the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas on October 24, 2025. The comet, discovered in July by the ATLAS system in Chile, is travelling through the Solar System at speeds exceeding 210,000 km/h.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it confirms natural activity in the comet, dispelling theories regarding a technological origin that have circulated online. The MeerKAT telescope, equipped with 64 antennas, has identified absorption lines indicating the presence of hydroxyl radicals, a byproduct of solar radiation interacting with water.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas distance from the Sun: 1.38 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Detection frequency: 1.665 GHz and 1.667 GHz</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Minimum distance to Earth: 1.8 AU (270 million km)</li>
    <li>Current speed relative to the Sun: around 100,000 km/h</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/Atlas was initially detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Río Hurtado, Chile. In August, NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office began monitoring the object, following established protocols for unidentified celestial bodies. Astronomers observed the comet's increasing activity in September, which led to the significant detection of radio signals in October.</p>

<p>3I/Atlas reached its closest point to the Sun, or perihelion, on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 AU. After this date, Lowell Observatory noted the comet's reemergence on October 31, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The detection of OH absorption confirms that we are dealing with a natural phenomenon," said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist involved in the analysis of the comet. "Our observations have shown no signs of artificial emissions."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Its origins are thought to trace back to the thick disk of the Milky Way, estimated to be up to seven billion years old. Previous observations of the comet revealed only noise, indicating a significant increase in activity leading up to the October detections.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations will include monitoring the comet's hydroxyl production to determine if it is consistent or intermittent. The Juno probe will search for low-frequency signals in 2026, while the ESA's Juice mission is expected to track the comet in the coming days.</p>
