      <h2>New 3I/ATLAS image shows strange 'sunward jet' raising further questions</h2>

<p>A new image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, taken by British astronomers Michael Buechner and Frank Niebling, reveals jets emanating from the comet in at least two directions. The photo was captured on November 9 and shows two anti-tail jets and a longer jet directed towards the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery raises significant questions about the comet's characteristics and behaviour. Scientists are puzzled by the size and direction of the jets, which may hinder the ability of space probes to analyze them. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has noted that the jets could be too large for instruments aboard Earth-based satellites and spacecraft to capture effectively.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Image taken on November 9, 2023.</li>
    <li>Jets measure 0.95 million kilometres towards the Sun and 2.85 million kilometres away from it.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be 269 million kilometres from Earth at its nearest point.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Juno spacecraft will observe the comet on March 16, 2026, from 53 million kilometres away.</li>
    <li>ESA’s JUICE spacecraft is currently 64 million kilometres from 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 9, 2023, astronomers Buechner and Niebling captured a processed image of 3I/ATLAS, showing its complex jet structures. The image reveals two anti-tail jets extending towards the Sun and a longer tail jet moving in the opposite direction. The size of these jets has raised concerns about the feasibility of capturing particles from them using current technology.</p>

<p>On July 21, 2023, the Hubble Space Telescope captured a glowing halo around 3I/ATLAS. The new image suggests that the current jets are significantly larger than previously observed features.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The picture shows two anti-tail jets out to 10 arcminutes towards the Sun accompanied by a longer collimated jet,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The diameter of 3I/ATLAS must be bigger than five kilometres,” Loeb added, discussing its potential size and mass.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time 3I/ATLAS has intrigued scientists. Previous observations have indicated unusual characteristics, prompting further investigation into its composition and behaviour. The comet's mass has raised eyebrows, as estimates suggest it could exceed 50 billion tons, which is significantly larger than other known interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from the latest images and prepare for future observations by NASA’s Juno and ESA’s JUICE spacecraft. These missions will aim to gather more information about the comet’s jets and overall structure as it approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>
