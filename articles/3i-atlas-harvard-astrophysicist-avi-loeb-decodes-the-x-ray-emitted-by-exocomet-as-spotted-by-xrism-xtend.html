      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb Decodes The X-ray Emitted By Exocomet As Spotted By XRISM Xtend</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has analyzed the X-ray emissions from comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The analysis follows observations made by the XRISM spacecraft from November 26 to November 28, 2025, indicating significant findings related to the comet's composition.</p>

<p>This research is crucial as it provides insight into the nature of 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar visitor recorded in the solar system, following <strong>1I/Oumuamua</strong> and <strong>2I/Borisov</strong>. Authorities, including the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and NASA, are collaborating on further studies to understand the comet's characteristics and its potential impact on our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation dates:</strong> November 26, 2025, to November 28, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observing agency:</strong> XRISM (X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance of X-ray glow:</strong> approximately 400,000 km</li>
    <li><strong>Emission components detected:</strong> carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, various Earth- and space-based observatories have tracked and studied its properties. Between November 26 and November 28, 2025, the XRISM spacecraft conducted a Target of Opportunity observation, revealing a faint X-ray glow around the comet.</p>
<p>On November 29, 2025, XRISM announced its preliminary findings in The Astronomer’s Telegram (ATel), highlighting the significant X-ray emissions detected.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Xtend spectrum shows excess emission components associated with carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen beyond the background emission from the Milky-Way galaxy or the Earth’s atmospheric emission,” said Avi Loeb in his latest blog post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is an important clue that the observed emission may indeed arise from charge-exchange interactions between the gas surrounding 3I/ATLAS and the solar wind,” Loeb added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It would be particularly interesting to check if there are any other X-ray features different from the expected signatures of charge-exchange reactions with the solar wind,” he concluded.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object recorded in the solar system. Its predecessors, 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the characteristics of interstellar objects. The collaboration between JAXA and NASA on XRISM marks a significant advancement in our ability to study such celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further studies are expected to continue as researchers analyze the X-ray emissions from 3I/ATLAS. Scientists aim to investigate additional features that may emerge from the comet's interactions with the solar wind.</p>
