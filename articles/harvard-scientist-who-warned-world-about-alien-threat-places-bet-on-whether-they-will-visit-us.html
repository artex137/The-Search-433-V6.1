      <h2>Harvard scientist who warned world about ‘alien threat’ places bet on whether they will visit us</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist known for his claims regarding a potential alien threat, has placed a $1,000 bet on whether aliens will be officially discovered before 2030. The wager comes amid his assertions about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which he describes as exhibiting unusual characteristics compared to typical comets. Loeb has publicly challenged NASA's classification of 3I/ATLAS as a comet, insisting it deserves further investigation.</p>

<p>This bet underscores ongoing discussions in the scientific community regarding extraterrestrial life. While Loeb advocates for an open-minded approach to the possibility of alien technology, NASA maintains that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, as it will pass at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb has placed a $1,000 bet regarding the discovery of aliens before December 31, 2030.</li>
    <li>The bet was made against Dr. Michael Shermer, director of The Skeptics Society.</li>
    <li>Loeb claims that 3I/ATLAS shows qualities not typically seen in comets.</li>
    <li>Nasa has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat and behaves like a standard comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will come closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has consistently expressed his views on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Recently, he accepted a bet from Dr. Michael Shermer, who argues that aliens will not be discovered by 2030. The terms of the wager specify that at least two out of three scientific organizations must confirm the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence by the deadline.</p>

<p>Loeb has stated that he believes humanity should actively search for signs of extraterrestrial life. He emphasizes the need for scientific inquiry into potential extraterrestrial technological artifacts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Humanity should engage in the scientific search for extraterrestrial technological artifacts," said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's assertions regarding 3I/ATLAS have sparked considerable debate within the scientific community. His previous claims about the object being a "potentially hostile alien threat" have been met with skepticism. NASA's position remains that the object is a typical comet, which does not require further concern.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The outcome of Loeb's bet will not be determined until after December 31, 2030. In the meantime, the scientific community will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, particularly as it approaches Earth on December 19.</p>
