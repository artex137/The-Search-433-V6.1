      <h2>New Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Observations Suggest It Has Changed Course And May Have Lost Mass</h2>

<p>The astronomical community has reported that comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, has undergone significant changes following its close approach to the Sun. First detected on July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified passing through our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Recent observations indicate that the comet has changed its trajectory and may have experienced substantial mass loss.</p>

<p>This development is important as it challenges existing knowledge about interstellar objects and provides insights into their behavior. The ongoing monitoring of 3I/ATLAS allows scientists to gather data that could enhance understanding of cometary processes and the composition of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected on July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.</li>
    <li>Exceeds an eccentricity of 1, confirming its interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated radial acceleration of 1.1×10<sup>-6</sup> astronomical units per day squared.</li>
    <li>Showed transverse acceleration of 3.7×10<sup>-7</sup> astronomical units per day squared.</li>
    <li>Estimated mass loss of approximately 13% relative to its total mass.</li>
    <li>Brightening observed with Green-band measurements increasing by a factor of five.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023. Following its perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, between October 31 and November 4, astronomers documented significant changes in the comet's path. The object has shown non-gravitational acceleration, suggesting forces beyond gravity affecting its motion. Recent observations indicate notable brightening and possible outgassing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, stated, "The object has experienced unexpected behavior that challenges our understanding of interstellar objects." </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object identified, highlighting the rarity and significance of such encounters. Previous interstellar objects like 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov have provided valuable data on their origins and characteristics, contributing to the understanding of planetary system formation across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to gather further data on its mass loss, chemical composition, and trajectory evolution as it moves beyond our Solar System. Observations will include spectroscopic data and tracking of gas clouds surrounding the comet's nucleus.</p>
