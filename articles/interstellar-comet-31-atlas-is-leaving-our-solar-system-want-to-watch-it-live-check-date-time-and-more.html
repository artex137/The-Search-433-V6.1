      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Leaving Our Solar System</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS is drifting away from the solar system, and a livestream event will allow viewers to observe it tonight, November 19, starting at 11:15 PM ET. The comet, which is approximately the size of Manhattan, has intrigued astronomers since its discovery four months ago.</p>

<p>This event matters as it provides a unique opportunity for both scientists and the public to observe an interstellar object in real time. The Virtual Telescope Project will host the livestream, allowing viewers worldwide to see the comet as it travels through the constellation Virgo. NASA is also preparing to release high-resolution images of the comet taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which could offer more insights into its structure and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream Start Time:</strong> 11:15 PM ET on November 19</li>
    <li><strong>Viewing Location:</strong> Virtual Telescope Project, Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> +10.9 (not visible to the naked eye)</li>
    <li><strong>Image Capture Dates:</strong> October 1-7</li>
    <li><strong>NASA Image Release:</strong> Expected next week</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered four months ago, capturing the attention of astronomers due to its unusual trajectory and close encounters with several planets. The comet's livestream event will take place tonight, providing the last chance for the public to observe it closely as it exits the solar system.</p>
<p>NASA captured images of the comet in early October, but the release was delayed due to a government shutdown. The anticipated release of these images is expected to clarify the comet's physical characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, criticized the delay in image release: “Science should have been prioritized over bureaucracy. The truth about the nature of 3I/ATLAS will be revealed by the sharing of data, not by the storyline of gatekeepers.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has been at the center of controversy, sparking various theories about its nature and trajectory. Speculation has ranged from unusual comet behavior to discussions about possible extraterrestrial technology. Public interest has been heightened by statements from notable figures, including Elon Musk, who warned of potential catastrophic consequences if the comet were on a collision course with Earth. However, astronomers have confirmed there is no threat to our planet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa plans to release the high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS next week, which scientists hope will provide clarity on the comet's characteristics and possibly settle ongoing debates regarding its nature.</p>
