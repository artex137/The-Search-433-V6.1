      <h2>James Webb telescope images reveal something strange with interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing it is unusually rich in carbon dioxide. The observations were made on August 6, 2023, as the comet approaches the sun, according to a new study released on August 25.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may provide insights into the comet's origins beyond our solar system. Researchers have been studying 3I/ATLAS since its discovery in July 2023, as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object recorded. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in October 2023.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed on August 6, 2023.</li>
  <li>Study published on August 25, 2023, in a preprint paper on Zenodo.</li>
  <li>Comet's speed exceeds 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
  <li>Initial size estimates range from 7 miles (11 kilometers) to 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide.</li>
  <li>Comet likely 3 billion years older than the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. Initial observations using the James Webb Space Telescope took place on August 6, revealing its high carbon dioxide content. The findings were reported in a preprint paper on August 25, 2023. The comet is expected to approach the sun in October 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  "Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets." 
  <cite>— Researchers in the study</cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  "No one knows where the comet came from. It's like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second. You can't project that back with any accuracy to figure out where it started on its path."
  <cite>— David Jewitt, astronomer at UCLA</cite>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third confirmed interstellar object recorded. Its unusual carbon dioxide to water ratio may offer clues about its formation and journey through the cosmos. Prior studies of comets have indicated that their chemical compositions can reveal information about the early solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, aiming to collect more data about its composition and origins before it exits the solar system.</p>
