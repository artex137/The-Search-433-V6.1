      <h2>Scientists gear up for close-up look at interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS, with comet set to fly past Mars</h2>

<p>Astronomers will observe interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS up close when the comet flies past Mars on October 3, 2025. This event marks a significant opportunity for scientists to gain insights from this ancient deep space object.</p>

<p>The flyby is important because it allows researchers to use existing spacecraft and probes at Mars to study the comet's chemical makeup. The observations could yield valuable scientific information about the origins and nature of 3I/ATLAS, which is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> 3I/ATLAS flyby of Mars</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Initial discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar visitors:</strong> 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Observing spacecraft:</strong> UAE's Hope probe, NASA's MAVEN, ESA's Mars Express, and Trace Gas Orbiter</li>
    <li><strong>Future observations:</strong> Planned for late 2025 and early 2026 using spacecraft around Jupiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025. Initial observations sparked debate in the scientific community, particularly after Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggested it might be an artificial object. However, NASA's lead astronomer Tom Statler stated that the evidence supports its classification as a comet.</p>

<p>The comet is set to fly past Mars on October 3, 2025, during which time several spacecraft will observe it. Following this event, 3I/ATLAS will be obscured from Earth-based telescopes until early December 2025, as it will move to the opposite side of the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA's lead astronomer for Solar System small bodies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If confirmed, 3I will provide a means to explore the stellar and planetesimal formation process, and its astrobiological implications, in an early period of galactic history,” stated Thomas Marshall Eubanks, a former NASA scientist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the Solar System, following 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. Scientists believe it originated from the Milky Way's 'cosmic noon', a time of intense star formation that occurred 9-13 billion years ago.</p>

<p>The comet's unusual properties have led to speculation, but the scientific community largely agrees on its natural origins. Observations during the flyby will enhance understanding of cosmic history and the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After the flyby, astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS using solar observatories like the Parker Solar Probe. Further observations are planned for late 2025 and early 2026 with spacecraft around Jupiter, as researchers seek to unlock more secrets of this ancient comet.</p>
