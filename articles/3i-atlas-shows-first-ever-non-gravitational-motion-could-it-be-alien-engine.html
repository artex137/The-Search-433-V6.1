      <h2>3I/ATLAS shows first-ever non-gravitational motion– Could it be alien engine?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has demonstrated its first-ever non-gravitational acceleration as it reached its closest point to the Sun, 203 million kilometers away, on October 29, 2025. This unusual behavior has intensified speculation about the object's origins, with some suggesting it may be a comet or an “alien probe.”</p>

<p>This development raises significant questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, prompting researchers and scientists to investigate further. The measurements taken during perihelion indicate a deviation in motion that could signify either a natural or artificial cause, according to experts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest distance to the Sun: 203 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Date of perihelion: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration observed: approximately 10 times the Earth’s radius</li>
    <li>Mass loss observations expected by European Space Agency (ESA) in early November</li>
    <li>Additional observations by Hubble and Webb telescopes planned for December</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun, where it exhibited non-gravitational acceleration. This discovery has led to two competing explanations regarding its behavior, as noted by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, the ESA's JUICE spacecraft will begin observing the mass loss of 3I/ATLAS, while additional data from the Hubble and Webb telescopes will be collected in December to further analyze the object’s nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote> 
    “The scientific community should take into account all anomalies to understand the nature and origin of the 3I/ATLAS interstellar object,” said Professor Avi Loeb from Harvard.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time an interstellar object has drawn attention for its unusual characteristics. Previous studies of other objects have sparked debates about their origins and compositions. The ongoing analysis of 3I/ATLAS may contribute to a broader understanding of such interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely. The upcoming observations by ESA, Hubble, and Webb are expected to provide critical data that could clarify whether the object is a comet or a technological artifact.</p>
