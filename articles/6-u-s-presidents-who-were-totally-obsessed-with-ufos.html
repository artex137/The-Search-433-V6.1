      <h2>U.S. Presidents' Fascination with UFOs</h2>

<p>Several U.S. presidents have shown a notable interest in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over the decades, revealing an unexpected fixation on what might be in the skies. This interest spans across party lines and has led to significant public discussions about UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>This fascination with UFOs matters as it reflects a broader cultural curiosity and has influenced governmental transparency on the subject. Recent developments have seen increased military attention to UAPs, prompting discussions about potential investigations and disclosures regarding such phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In 1966, Congressman Gerald Ford called for a congressional hearing on UFOs after lights were reported in Michigan skies.</li>
    <li>Jimmy Carter reported a UFO sighting in Georgia in 1969 and promised UFO transparency during his presidential campaign.</li>
    <li>Ronald Reagan expressed interest in UFOs, establishing a space advisory council during his presidency.</li>
    <li>Bill Clinton investigated the Roswell incident and expressed curiosity about extraterrestrial life.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<blockquote>Barack Obama stated, “Some military footage shows things flying in ways we can’t explain,” acknowledging the credibility of reported UAPs.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
