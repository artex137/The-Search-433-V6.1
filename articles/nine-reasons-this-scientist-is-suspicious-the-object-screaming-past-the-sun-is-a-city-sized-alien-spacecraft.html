      <h2>Harvard Astronomer Raises Questions About Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomer <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has expressed skepticism about the true nature of <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, an interstellar object currently traveling through the solar system. Loeb argues that the object, which is likely a comet, may instead be a city-sized alien spacecraft. His claims have sparked significant interest in the scientific community as 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to the Sun.</p>

<p>This matter is important as it touches on the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life and the characteristics of interstellar objects. While many scientists believe 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, Loeb's assertions have prompted discussions about its unusual properties and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, currently moving through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Loeb has outlined nine "anomalies" that he believes support his hypothesis of it being an alien spacecraft.</li>
    <li>The object has a diameter of over <strong>5 kilometers</strong> and an estimated mass of more than <strong>33 billion tons</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass within <strong>33.3 million miles</strong> of Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
    <li>It has shown a second tail pointing towards the Sun, which Loeb claims is unprecedented.</li>
    <li>Loeb suggests it may have emitted the "Wow! Signal," a radio signal detected in 1977.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected as it entered the solar system. Over time, astronomers have observed its trajectory, noting its proximity to Mars in early October when European Space Agency spacecraft captured images of the object.</p>
<p>Loeb has been vocal about his findings, recently updating his blog to include a ninth anomaly related to the object's brightness and color as it approaches perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This anomalous anti-tail, not a result of geometric perspective, had never been reported before for solar system comets,” Loeb wrote in a recent blog post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“At the distances at which comets are observed, the temperature is far too low to vaporize silicate, sulfide, and metallic grains that contain nickel and iron atoms,” an international team of astronomers stated in a preprint paper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There’s plenty of evidence we’re simply looking at a rare visitor in the form of a natural comet,” said NASA’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies, Tom Statler.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following <strong>'Oumuamua</strong> and <strong>2I/Borisov</strong>. The unusual properties of 3I/ATLAS have led to debates about the likelihood of detecting more interstellar objects in the future. In recent years, scientific communities have shown increasing interest in understanding the origins and compositions of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and characteristics. Further observations may clarify whether the anomalies noted by Loeb hold significance or if they can be explained by natural phenomena.</p>
