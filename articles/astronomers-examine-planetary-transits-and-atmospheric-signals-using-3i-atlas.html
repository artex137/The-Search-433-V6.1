      <h2>Astronomers examine planetary transits and atmospheric signals using 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have examined planetary transits and atmospheric signals using the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, according to a January 10, 2025, blog post by Harvard professor Avi Loeb. The analysis connects the principles of transit spectroscopy to the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the inner Solar System.</p>

<p>This research is significant because it explores how starlight filtered through planetary atmospheres can reveal chemical signatures. Authorities are now focusing on enhancing observational techniques to detect these signals during specific geometric alignments of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Blog post date: January 10, 2025</li>
    <li>Research led by: Professor Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li>Notable transit event: Venus transit observed on November 4, 2024</li>
    <li>Future detection: NSF-DOE Rubin Observatory expected to identify dozens of interstellar objects in the next decade</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2014, Avi Loeb asked then-undergraduate student Henry Lin to calculate the detectability of industrial pollutants in exoplanet atmospheres. Their research identified spectral features of chlorofluorocarbons observable under favorable conditions. On January 10, 2025, Loeb published a blog post discussing how the transit method could be applied to interstellar observations.</p>

<p>Loeb noted that 3I/ATLAS has a retrograde orbit aligned within 4.9 degrees of the ecliptic plane and could have observed transits involving Mercury, Mars, Venus, and Earth on specific dates in 2025 and 2026. However, most of these events resulted in near misses due to small orbital inclinations, with the exception of the Venus transit on November 4, 2024.</p>

<p>On December 26, 2025, Loeb published a separate analysis of images showing a sunward anti-tail jet from 3I/ATLAS, extending at least 400,000 kilometers. He derived constraints on dust particle sizes based on solar radiation pressure and gas drag calculations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "An observer traveling through the ecliptic plane of the Solar System could use the transit method to monitor biological and technological changes on Earth over time."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "These constraints are consistent with natural cometary processes, while also noting that alternative mechanisms would not be subject to the same limits."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Transit spectroscopy is a well-established technique used to study exoplanets. It involves measuring the light from a star as a planet passes in front of it, allowing researchers to identify atmospheric components. The study of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS expands the application of these techniques beyond traditional astronomy.</p>

<p>Loeb's research builds on previous work that has sought to identify technological and biological signatures in planetary atmospheres, linking the study of exoplanets with the potential for interstellar observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations will include checks for precise alignments between interstellar trajectories and planetary transits as these objects approach the Sun. The NSF-DOE Rubin Observatory is expected to play a key role in detecting new interstellar objects over the next decade.</p>
