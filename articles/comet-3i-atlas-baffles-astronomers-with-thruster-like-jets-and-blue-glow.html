      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Baffles Astronomers with "Thruster-Like" Jets and Blue Glow</h2>

<p>Astronomers have expressed astonishment over interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has displayed unusual thruster-like gas jets and a striking blue glow. First detected by Hawaii's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope, the comet is currently under investigation by NASA and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) to determine the nature of its propulsion patterns, which have not been observed in any other comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges current understanding of cometary physics. Researchers are examining whether the comet's emissions are due to natural processes or something unprecedented. The investigation is critical for expanding knowledge about the behavior of interstellar objects and their composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected by ATLAS telescope in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESO investigating the comet’s unusual behavior.</li>
    <li>Short, rhythmic bursts detected in late October 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet brightened nearly tenfold within 48 hours.</li>
    <li>Comet displays a bright electric-blue glow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2023, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory detected rhythmic bursts from 3I/ATLAS, altering its path. Shortly after, the comet brightened significantly, raising questions about its internal processes. Observatories in Chile and Hawaii captured its unusual blue glow, revealing a chemical signature not previously seen in comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is behaving as if it's correcting its own course... something we'd expect from a spacecraft, not a comet,” said Dr Elena Markov of the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Something inside 3I/ATLAS seems to be changing rapidly. It's either venting volatile materials we've never seen before or undergoing structural collapse,” said Dr David Jewitt, a planetary scientist at UCLA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This blue colouration is a chemical fingerprint we've never encountered in a comet before,” noted Dr James O'Donnell of Cambridge University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS has prompted comparisons to the interstellar object 'Oumuamua, which was also the subject of speculation regarding its origins. The current investigation reflects ongoing efforts by scientists to understand interstellar visitors and their implications for cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Both the James Webb Space Telescope and the ESO's Very Large Telescope will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the inner solar system. NASA has stated that the coming weeks are crucial for determining whether the comet's jets will persist or stabilize.</p>
