      <h2>Our solar system has a new interstellar visitor: Meet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A team of international astronomers, including a doctoral student from the University of Michigan, has discovered 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, on July 3. The discovery was made possible by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), which uses telescopes in various locations to scan the sky for moving objects.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides researchers with a rare opportunity to study an object born outside our solar system. Astronomers are excited about the potential findings, which could enhance understanding of the galaxy. Aster Taylor, a Hertz Fellow in the U-M Department of Astronomy, emphasized the importance of public interest in fostering funding for future astronomical tools and discoveries.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object has a hyperbolic velocity of just under 60 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Its estimated diameter is up to 10 kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between 3 billion and 11 billion years old.</li>
    <li>ATLAS consists of four telescopes located in Hawaii, Chile, and South Africa.</li>
    <li>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has come online this summer to aid in future discoveries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discovery process involved several key moments. Initial observations of 3I/ATLAS began on July 1, when researchers suspected it was an interstellar object. Aster Taylor, while on vacation in Fiji, had to quickly shift focus to confirm the object's status. On July 3, the ATLAS team officially announced the discovery.</p>
<p>Following confirmation, the team mobilized to gather data for further study. They activated observing time on major facilities, including the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope and the Gemini Observatory, to analyze the object's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This is what we're here for -- finding objects like this, making the public aware of them and generating excitement," said Aster Taylor, U-M Department of Astronomy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "It's an auspicious time to find cool objects," Taylor added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "We have had false alarms in the past about interesting objects, so we know not to get too excited on the first day," said Larry Denneau, an ATLAS team member.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the only other known interstellar objects were 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The discovery of these objects has opened new avenues for astronomical research, allowing scientists to gather insights into the formation and composition of celestial bodies outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to use space telescopes like Hubble and JWST to further investigate 3I/ATLAS. They aim to learn more about its size, spin, and surface composition as it approaches the sun over the coming months.</p>
