      <h2>Comet 3I ATLAS Approaches Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I ATLAS has been observed approaching Earth, with its closest approach expected on December 21, 2023, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's trajectory.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a unique opportunity for scientists to study the comet's composition and behavior. Authorities at JPL have been monitoring its path closely to ensure it poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS will make its closest approach on December 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>There are no reported threats to Earth from the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet was first discovered in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS was first discovered in 2019 by astronomers using the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Since then, it has been tracked by various observatories, including NASA's JPL. As it approaches Earth, scientists continue to observe its trajectory and collect data.</p>

<p>On December 21, 2023, the comet will reach its closest point to Earth, allowing for further observations and analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are excited to observe Comet 3I ATLAS as it nears Earth. This is a great opportunity to learn more about comets and their behavior,” said a spokesperson from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS is part of a larger group of celestial bodies that scientists study to understand the formation of the solar system. Previous comets, such as Comet Hale-Bopp in 1997, have provided valuable insights into these processes.</p>

<p>NASA and other space agencies regularly monitor comets and asteroids to assess potential threats to Earth. This tracking is crucial for planetary defense initiatives.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I ATLAS approaches, scientists will continue to collect data and share their findings with the public. Observations will be conducted during its closest approach on December 21, 2023.</p>
