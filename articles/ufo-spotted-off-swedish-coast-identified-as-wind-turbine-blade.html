      <h2>'UFO' spotted off Swedish coast identified as wind turbine blade</h2>

<p>The Swedish coast guard has identified an object previously described as a “UFO” floating off the coast as a wind turbine blade. The object was spotted last week in the waters near Guleskär, a port town close to Sweden’s southern border with Norway. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the incident.</p>

<p>This identification matters as it underscores the potential hazards that unidentified objects can pose to maritime navigation. The coast guard received a tip-off from the Swedish Maritime Administration and the Smögen Sea Rescue Society, leading to the recovery of the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred off the coast of Guleskär, Sweden.</li>
    <li>The object measured approximately 15 metres in length and 5 metres in width.</li>
    <li>The coast guard received reports of the object last week.</li>
    <li>The object posed a danger to shipping before being towed to shore.</li>
    <li>Details on how the blade ended up at sea are not disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Last week, the Swedish coast guard was alerted to a large unidentified object floating offshore. Following a tip-off from the Swedish Maritime Administration and the Smögen Sea Rescue Society, a coast guard vessel was dispatched to investigate.</p>
<p>The crew towed the object to the port in Guleskär, where it was later identified as most likely being part of a wind turbine blade. The coast guard has not disclosed the origin of the blade or why it was left adrift.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>The coast guard said the object was large enough to pose a danger to shipping.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Sweden has a limited number of offshore wind farms, such as the Kårehamn array operated by German utility RWE, which was commissioned in 2013. The country has faced challenges in expanding its offshore wind capacity, including a recent decision to cancel 13 planned wind farms due to concerns over potential interference with radar systems amid geopolitical tensions with Russia.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The coast guard has not announced any further investigations or actions regarding the incident. The status of the wind turbine blade and its origin remain unclear.</p>
