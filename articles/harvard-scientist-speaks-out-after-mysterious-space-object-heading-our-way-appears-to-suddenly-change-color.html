      <h2>Harvard scientist speaks out after mysterious space object heading our way appears to suddenly change color</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar comet, known as 3I/ATLAS, is displaying an unusual color shift as it approaches the Sun, according to scientists from NASA and Harvard University. Discovered in July by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, this comet is the third confirmed object from interstellar space and is estimated to be about 11.2 kilometers wide.</p>

<p>This comet's imminent approach is significant as it provides a unique opportunity for scientists to study an interstellar body. The color change from red to green may indicate increased cyanide gas production as 3I/ATLAS moves closer to the Sun, according to Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor and founding director of the Institute for Theory and Computation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2023</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: ATLAS survey telescope, Chile</li>
    <li>Estimated size: 11.2 kilometers wide</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: Halloween 2025</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: ʻOumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>Primary gases detected: Carbon dioxide (CO₂), traces of carbon monoxide (CO), and water (H₂O)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023 by the ATLAS survey telescope. Initial observations indicated the comet appeared red. As it approached the Sun, images taken later revealed a green glow, attributed to increased cyanide production. Data from various telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope, confirmed significant changes in the comet's composition and brightness.</p>

<p>On July 21, 2025, further observations from the Hubble Space Telescope provided insight into the gas composition surrounding the comet. In August 2025, data from the James Webb Space Telescope and SPHEREx observatory supported these findings, indicating a dramatic rise in cyanide production.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, Harvard professor and founding director of the Institute for Theory and Computation, stated, "The shift suggests the comet changed from scattering sunlight on reddish surface dust to releasing small, bright icy grains that altered how light traveled through the surrounding plume."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed by scientists, following the discoveries of ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such objects enhances our understanding of the formation and composition of celestial bodies originating from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition. The closest pass to the Sun is expected around Halloween 2025, after which the comet will head back into deep space, not to return.</p>
