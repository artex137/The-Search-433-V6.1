      <h2>Hellfire missile hits unidentified object over Yemen</h2>

<p>Footage has emerged showing a Hellfire missile striking a mysterious orb off the coast of Yemen, raising questions about the object's identity. No injuries or fatalities have been reported from the incident, which occurred on October 30, 2024.</p>

<p>This incident has reignited discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities are analyzing the footage and statements from scientists, including Harvard's Avi Loeb, who suggest the object may not be of extraterrestrial origin but rather a drone launched by Yemen's Houthis. The video was presented during a Congressional hearing on September 9 and shared by Rep. Eric Burlison, who received it from an anonymous whistleblower.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Type of missile: AGM-114 Hellfire</li>
    <li>Aircraft: MQ-9 Reaper drone</li>
    <li>Scientist involved: Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li>Reported drone type: Samad drone</li>
    <li>Previous attack by Houthis: Announced on October 29, targeting Southern Israel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2024, the Yemeni Houthis announced an attack on Southern Israel using multiple drones. The following day, an MQ-9 Reaper drone launched a Hellfire missile at an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen. Footage of this incident was later presented during a Congressional hearing on September 9, 2025.</p>

<blockquote>
    “The UAP appears to be a few meters in size, consistent with the Samad drones the Houthis use,” said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The missile hit the object but only managed to scrape off a few pieces as the warhead failed to detonate,” Avi Loeb stated in his blog.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The known speed of the Samad drones goes up to about 70 meters per second, which is about a sixth of the speed of a Hellfire missile,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a broader trend of increased drone activity in the region, particularly involving the Yemeni Houthis. The Houthis have previously utilized drones for attacks on neighboring countries, including Israel. The discussion around UAPs has intensified in recent years, with the U.S. government increasing transparency regarding such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating the footage and the circumstances surrounding the incident. Further analysis may clarify the nature and origin of the object struck by the missile.</p>
