      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Exhibits Unusual Behavior, Raises Questions</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed unexpected behavior as it travels through our solar system, according to reports from The Daily Mail. The object has appeared to reverse thrust while disappearing behind the Sun, prompting speculation about its nature. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has raised concerns that 3I/ATLAS could be more than just a typical comet.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it may challenge existing understanding of celestial objects. Authorities, including NASA, have responded by adding 3I/ATLAS to a list of tracked threats, although it is not projected to collide with Earth. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun on October 29.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of reversing thrust.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun is expected on October 29.</li>
    <li>Nasa has included 3I/ATLAS on a list of tracked threats.</li>
    <li>227 observatories worldwide are monitoring the object.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is shedding nickel at roughly five grams per second.</li>
    <li>It is larger than the asteroid that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is anticipated on December 19.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August, a study revealed that 3I/ATLAS emits nickel without detectable iron, which is unusual for natural comets. The study indicated that the object is shedding nickel and cyanide at increasing rates as it approaches the Sun.</p>
<p>On October 29, 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to the Sun, which could provide further insights into its behavior. The comet is expected to come near Earth on December 19, followed by close observations planned for March 16, 2026, when it approaches the Juno spacecraft near Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "If 3I/ATLAS comes out of this blind spot in a completely different place than gravity was taking it, it would be a clear sign the object was artificial and likely powered by some kind of engine."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb added, "We should not miss an opportunity because this is a gift from interstellar space."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS has drawn comparisons to the interstellar object Oumuamua, which was observed in 2017. Both objects have sparked debate within the scientific community regarding their origins and implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>Loeb has criticized some astronomers for being overly cautious, arguing that they prioritize reputation over exploration. He believes the arrival of such objects signals a lack of understanding about cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and the Sun. Observations planned for December 19 and March 16, 2026, will aim to gather detailed data about the comet’s characteristics and behavior.</p>
