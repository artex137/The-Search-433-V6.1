      <h2>Aliens are real, says Barack Obama</h2>

<p>Former US President Barack Obama has confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life during a podcast appearance on ‘No Lie’ with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen on October 26, 2023. Obama stated, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them,” while rejecting claims that aliens are concealed at Area 51, a classified military base in Nevada.</p>

<p>Obama’s comments have reignited discussions surrounding UFOs and government secrecy. His remarks come as public interest in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) has surged, prompting U.S. authorities to enhance investigations and transparency regarding these incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of podcast: October 26, 2023</li>
    <li>Location of Area 51: Groom Lake, Nevada</li>
    <li>Official term for UFOs: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP)</li>
    <li>Year the U.S. government acknowledged Area 51: 2013</li>
    <li>Department of Defense office established for UAP investigations: All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, the Roswell incident in New Mexico sparked widespread speculation about UFOs and government cover-ups. Over the decades, Area 51 has become a focal point for conspiracy theories regarding alien technology and reverse engineering.</p>

<p>In 2021, the Pentagon released declassified videos showing UAPs, which bolstered public interest in the subject. Obama addressed these sightings during a late-night talk show appearance, emphasizing the seriousness of ongoing investigations.</p>

<p>In his recent podcast, Obama reiterated his curiosity about extraterrestrial life, saying, “Where are the aliens?” He dismissed the notion of an underground facility at Area 51, suggesting that such a conspiracy would be too extensive to conceal from the U.S. president.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “They’re not being kept in – what is it? There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.” 
    <cite>— Barack Obama</cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “There is footage and records of objects in the sky that could not be fully explained, including their movement and trajectory.” 
    <cite>— Barack Obama, 2021</cite>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has long been associated with conspiracy theories about UFOs. The U.S. government’s acknowledgment of the base has not diminished speculation but has instead fueled further theories regarding alien technology and military secrecy. The recent establishment of the AARO indicates a shift towards greater transparency in UAP investigations.</p>

<p>Obama's comments reflect a growing recognition of the importance of addressing public interest in UAPs and the need for credible information from authorities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP sightings continue under the AARO, with lawmakers advocating for increased transparency. Obama’s remarks may prompt further discussions about government accountability and public access to information regarding extraterrestrial phenomena.</p>
