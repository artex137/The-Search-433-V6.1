      <h2>New images of Interstellar 3I/ATLAS comet 'with a heartbeat' released by NASA</h2>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is exhibiting unusual pulsing behaviour. The comet, located approximately 178 million miles from Earth, was photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope on November 30, 2025. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>The images show the comet as a white dot, with sunlight reflecting off a coma of gas and dust surrounding it. Scientists are eager to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth for a close encounter on December 19, 2025. The unusual "heartbeat" pulsing observed has sparked interest and debate among astrophysicists regarding the comet's behaviour and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 3.5 miles wide.</li>
    <li>The comet was photographed by Hubble on November 30, 2025, and by ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) on November 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has suggested the pulsing may indicate alien activity, while Dr. Matthew Genge from Imperial College London has countered this with a natural explanation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 2, 2025, the ESA's Juice orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS when it was approximately 41 million miles away. This image showed the comet's coma and hints of two tails, a plasma tail and a dust tail.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2025, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope took images of the comet from about 178 million miles away, providing further insight into its characteristics.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it’s a heartbeat, then those aliens are really, really, super chill,” said Dr. Avi Loeb regarding the comet's pulsing behaviour.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There’s a periodic brightening of the comet. That’s actually nothing particularly unusual,” stated Dr. Matthew Genge, who described the media attention around the comet as “ludicrous.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of three known interstellar comets, following the discovery of Oumuamua in 2017. Scientists believe that the presence of interstellar comets may be more common than previously thought, as advancements in detection technology have improved visibility.</p>
<p>Dr. Genge noted that while three interstellar comets have been identified, this number is still too small to draw reliable conclusions about their frequency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, it will continue to be monitored by astronomers. After its closest approach, the comet is expected to move out of the solar system, with scientists keen to learn more about its composition and behaviour during its journey.</p>
