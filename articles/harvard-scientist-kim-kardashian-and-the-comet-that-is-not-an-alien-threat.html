      <h2>Harvard scientist Kim Kardashian and the comet that is not an alien threat</h2>

<p>Kim Kardashian has engaged NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, about the comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through our solar system. Kardashian's inquiry, made on social media platform X just before Halloween, prompted Duffy to clarify that there is no threat to Earth from this celestial body.</p>

<p>Authorities have assured the public that claims regarding 3I/ATLAS as a potential alien spacecraft are unfounded. Duffy emphasized that the comet poses no danger, stating, “No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth.” The comet, which has attracted attention due to its unusual characteristics and speculations from noted scientists, is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: Approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li>NASA acting administrator: Sean Duffy</li>
    <li>Principal investigator for Breakthrough Listen: Andrew Siemion</li>
    <li>Comet characteristics: Estimated width of 3.5 miles, contains high levels of carbon dioxide and nickel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the University of Hawaii’s Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Alert System. Since its discovery, it has generated significant public interest, including inquiries from celebrities and discussions on popular media platforms.</p>
<p>In October 2025, Kim Kardashian directly asked Duffy about the comet on social media, prompting a response that reassured the public about its origins. Duffy's response highlighted the comet's non-threatening nature and dismissed claims of extraterrestrial connections.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches its closest point to Earth, observations will continue from various telescopes, including the James Webb and Hubble telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Great question! No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said Sean Duffy in response to Kardashian’s inquiry about 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“People are aware of it, and they’re very excited about it,” said Andrew Siemion, reflecting public interest in the comet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What I’m saying is we should consider this possibility,” stated Avi Loeb, discussing the need for serious consideration of the comet's origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet's unusual properties have led to speculation among scientists, particularly Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist. Loeb has suggested that certain characteristics of 3I/ATLAS might indicate an artificial origin, a claim met with skepticism by other astronomers who assert it behaves like a typical comet.</p>
<p>Public fascination with the possibility of extraterrestrial life has been fueled by both scientific discourse and popular culture, including discussions on platforms like Joe Rogan's podcast.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming weeks, further observations of 3I/ATLAS will be conducted using advanced telescopes. Scientists will continue to analyze its trajectory and composition, while public interest remains high as the comet approaches Earth.</p>
