      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: Check Date, Time And How To Watch Live</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently visible in the eastern sky, moving through the constellation Virgo, just before dawn. The comet, which is approximately the size of Manhattan, has captured public interest since its discovery on July 1, 2023. It recently passed its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023.</p>

<p>This event is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a live stream of the comet on its official YouTube channel tonight at 11:15 PM ET, allowing viewers to observe this unique celestial body in real-time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Live Stream Time:</strong> 11:15 PM ET</li>
    <li><strong>Location in Sky:</strong> Constellation Virgo, rising in the eastern sky before dawn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023. Following its discovery, an analysis confirmed its interstellar origins. The comet reached its perihelion, or closest point to the sun, on October 30, 2023. Since then, it has moved out from the sun's glare and is currently visible in the early morning sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Virtual Telescope Project will host a live feed of 3I/ATLAS tonight at 11:15 PM ET on its official YouTube channel.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. Its size and visibility have sparked significant interest among astronomers and the general public alike. The previous interstellar objects, 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov, have also drawn attention for their unique characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Viewers can look forward to the live stream of Comet 3I/ATLAS tonight, which will provide real-time telescopic footage as the comet continues its journey through our solar system.</p>
