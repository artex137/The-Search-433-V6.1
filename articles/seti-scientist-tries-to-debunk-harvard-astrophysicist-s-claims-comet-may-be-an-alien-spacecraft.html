      <h2>SETI Scientist Tries To Debunk Harvard Astrophysicist's Claims Comet May Be An Alien Spacecraft</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has suggested that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may not be a natural object, sparking debate among scientists. Loeb, who leads Harvard's Galileo Project, raised the possibility in a blog post last week, contending that the comet could be avoiding detection by Earth-based telescopes. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this claim.</p>

<p>This discussion matters as it touches on the search for extraterrestrial life, a field of growing interest among scientists and the public. The SETI Institute and other researchers are actively evaluating the evidence surrounding 3I/ATLAS to determine its true nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 2, 2019.</li>
  <li>Avi Loeb estimates a 30–40% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS may not have a natural origin.</li>
  <li>The comet travels at approximately 58 kilometers per second.</li>
  <li>Loeb previously speculated about another interstellar object, 1I/’Oumuamua.</li>
  <li>Tom Statler from NASA states that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2019, comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected. In subsequent research, Avi Loeb proposed that the comet's trajectory may indicate an artificial origin. Last week, he reiterated his claims in a blog post, suggesting a 30–40% chance that it is not a natural object. Meanwhile, Eahsanul Haque from the SETI Institute provided evidence supporting the comet's natural origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA lead scientist for solar system small bodies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity, and would possibly require defensive measures to be undertaken, though these might prove futile,” stated Avi Loeb in a blog post.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Avi Loeb has faced skepticism regarding his claims about interstellar objects. His earlier speculation about 1I/’Oumuamua drew criticism from the scientific community, including the SETI Institute. The ongoing discussion about 3I/ATLAS continues to highlight the divide between researchers who support the idea of extraterrestrial intelligence and those who advocate for more conventional explanations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers from various institutions, including the SETI Institute and NASA, will continue to analyze 3I/ATLAS to clarify its origins and characteristics. Further studies and observations are expected to provide more data on the comet's behavior.</p>
