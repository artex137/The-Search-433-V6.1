      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Caught On Camera From Mars Orbit</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s (ESA) spacecraft Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) have captured images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from Mars orbit over the last week. The orbiters were tasked with observing the comet instead of their usual focus on the Red Planet. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides a rare glimpse of the comet, which is currently not visible from Earth due to its position on the opposite side of the Sun. ESA has shared a series of images taken by TGO, with the team still analyzing the data. According to ESA Project Scientist Colin Wilson, the observations contribute to a broader understanding of the comet's brightness and trajectory as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed from a distance of 29 million kilometers (18 million miles).</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at approximately 60 kilometers (37 miles) per second.</li>
    <li>Images were captured using the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS).</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is too small to be seen from this distance.</li>
    <li>The observations were made while Earth was on the opposite side of the Sun from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Over the past week, ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars TGO were redirected to observe comet 3I/ATLAS. The orbiters successfully captured images of the comet, which is currently 29 million kilometers away from Mars. The data collected will be analyzed further to provide insights into the comet's brightness and trajectory.</p>

<p>ESA plans to conduct additional observations of the comet with its Jupiter-bound mission JUICE, which is scheduled for a closer examination after the comet's nearest approach to the Sun in a few weeks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was a challenge for our orbiters because, of course, their cameras were designed to look at objects only 1,000 kilometers away or less, and this was 30 million kilometers away,” said Colin Wilson, ESA Project Scientist for ExoMars and Mars Express.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We can certainly see it moving quickly, and the other thing is you can see it's not quite symmetrical in the field of view, which again is what we expect from a comet,” Wilson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Mars Express and TGO have previously conducted observations beyond Mars, including the transit of its moons, Deimos and Phobos, in front of other planets. In 2013, Mars Express observed Comet Siding Spring, which was significantly closer to Mars than 3I/ATLAS. This experience has equipped the orbiters for the current challenge.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA will continue to analyze the data collected from the comet and plans to make further observations during the JUICE mission, which will occur following the comet's closest passage to the Sun.</p>
