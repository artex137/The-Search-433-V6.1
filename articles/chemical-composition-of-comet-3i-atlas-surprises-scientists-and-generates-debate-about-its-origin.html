      <h2>Chemical composition of comet 3I/ATLAS surprises scientists and generates debate about its origin</h2>

<p>The global scientific community is focused on comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system. The comet's unique chemical composition, characterized by a high level of carbon dioxide (CO2) surpassing that of water in its coma, has raised questions about its origins.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing astronomical models and highlights the need for international collaboration in space research. NASA, facing budget constraints, has limited its observational capacity, prompting cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and other observatories to gather and analyze data on the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Identified:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Interstellar object, third detected after ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> High levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide</li>
    <li><strong>Trajectory:</strong> Hyperbolic, indicating it will not return after passing through the solar system</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments used:</strong> Telescópio Espacial James Webb (JWST)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was identified by the ATLAS telescope system. Subsequent analysis revealed its unusual chemical composition, particularly the predominance of CO2. Scientists confirmed its interstellar origin through the study of its hyperbolic trajectory, which indicates it is moving too fast to be captured by the Sun's gravity.</p>

<p>As data collection progressed, the ESA and various ground-based observatories began monitoring the comet, aiding in tracking its trajectory and brightness. The JWST played a crucial role in analyzing the comet's composition, confirming the presence of CO2 and carbon monoxide.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The predominance of carbon dioxide is an extremely rare feature and indicates that the comet probably formed in a very cold, carbon-rich environment,” said a lead astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This research exemplifies global scientific cooperation, as multiple agencies contribute to understanding this rare cosmic phenomenon,” said a representative from ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects, ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, had been detected, making this discovery particularly significant for astronomers. The unusual composition of 3I/ATLAS suggests that the ingredients for planetary formation may vary widely across different star systems, leading to new insights about the potential for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing studies will focus on further analyzing the comet's chemical profile and understanding its trajectory. Scientists aim to refine models of cosmic object density in the Milky Way and explore the implications for planetary system formation.</p>
