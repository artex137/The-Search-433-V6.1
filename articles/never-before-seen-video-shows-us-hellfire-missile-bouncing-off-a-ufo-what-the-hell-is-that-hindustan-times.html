      <h2>Never-before-seen video shows US Hellfire missile bouncing off a UFO</h2>

<p>A never-before-seen video has shown a US Hellfire missile bouncing harmlessly off an unidentified flying object (UFO) off the coast of Yemen. The footage, captured by an MQ-9 Reaper drone in October 2024, was released during a congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) this week. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The video has sparked disbelief in Washington and intensified calls for transparency regarding UAPs. Lawmakers are pressing the Pentagon for answers about decades of secrecy surrounding unexplained aerial encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video captured by an MQ-9 Reaper drone in October 2024.</li>
    <li>Footage released during a congressional hearing on UAPs.</li>
    <li>Representative Anna Paulina Luna shared the video on X.</li>
    <li>Representative Eric Burlison described the footage as “startling evidence.”</li>
    <li>Veteran UFO journalist George Knapp testified about similar incidents.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities reported from the incident.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone captured video footage of a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen. The missile was launched at the object but appeared to bounce off without detonating. The video was declassified and presented during a congressional hearing on UAPs in the week of the hearing.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Representative Anna Paulina Luna and Representative Eric Burlison discussed the implications of the footage. Veteran UFO journalist George Knapp also testified about similar incidents, highlighting a lack of public access to such videos.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“In today’s UAP hearing, we revealed new military surveillance video showing a UAP splitting a Hellfire missile in mid-air. Not a single witness was aware of any U.S. military technology capable of such a feat.” - Representative Anna Paulina Luna</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A Reaper drone fired a Hellfire missile at this thing. And the missile didn’t seem to have any effect.” - Representative Eric Burlison</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That’s a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and it just bounced right off, and it kept going. What the hell is that?” - George Knapp</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent video release has added to ongoing discussions about UAPs and the US government's handling of such incidents. Lawmakers have increasingly demanded transparency, citing a history of secrecy surrounding unexplained aerial encounters. This comes amid a broader interest in UAPs, with various sightings reported over the years.</p>

<p>During the same congressional hearing, US Air Force veteran Dylan Borland recounted a 2012 UFO encounter near Langley Air Force Base, where he observed a silent, 100-foot triangular craft, further illustrating the ongoing interest and concern regarding UAPs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers are expected to continue pressing the Pentagon for more information on UAPs and related incidents. Investigations into the footage and similar events may also be conducted to provide greater clarity on unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>
