      <h2>Jimmy Carter once saw a UFO — but had this to say about aliens on Earth</h2>

<p>Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has reported seeing a UFO in 1969 while he was in Leary, Georgia. Carter described the encounter as a bright light in the sky that changed colors and moved in a way that he found unusual.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as discussions about UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena have intensified in recent years. Authorities are increasingly acknowledging the need for transparency regarding such sightings, and Carter's experience adds to the dialogue about the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1969, Jimmy Carter and a group of about ten people observed a bright light in the night sky while waiting for a ride.

Despite the sighting, Carter has maintained that he does not believe aliens have visited Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
