      <h2>Jimmy Carter once saw a UFO — but had this to say about aliens on Earth</h2>

<p>Former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday at age 100, has recounted a personal experience of witnessing a UFO in 1969. The sighting occurred in southwest Georgia while he prepared to address a Lions Club meeting. Carter has remained skeptical about the existence of extraterrestrial life visiting Earth.</p>

<p>This acknowledgment matters as it adds to the ongoing public discourse regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and government transparency. Carter's statements reflect a historical context of UFO discussions among U.S. presidents, contributing to the broader conversation about the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Who:</strong> Former President Jimmy Carter</li>
    <li><strong>What:</strong> Observed a UFO</li>
    <li><strong>Where:</strong> Southwest Georgia</li>
    <li><strong>When:</strong> 1969</li>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Died at 100 on Sunday</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1969, while preparing for a speech to the Lions Club, Carter and approximately 25 others witnessed a bright light in the sky. The incident was recorded by Carter, who later dictated his observations into an audio tape recorder.</p>
<p>Carter publicly shared this experience in the early 1970s, before serving as Georgia's governor and later as the U.S. president. He reiterated his skepticism about the possibility that the UFO was of extraterrestrial origin in a 2005 interview with GQ magazine.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I saw an unidentified flying object. I’ve never believed that it came from Mars. I know enough physics to know that you can’t have vehicles that are tangible in nature flying from Mars, looking around, and then flying back.” 
    <strong>— Jimmy Carter</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “As far as covering up possible flights from distant satellites or distant heavenly bodies, I don’t believe in that, and there’s no evidence that it was ever covered up.” 
    <strong>— Jimmy Carter</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Carter's UFO sighting is part of a larger narrative involving U.S. presidents discussing UFOs. His successor, President Ronald Reagan, also reported a UFO sighting in 1974 while flying over California. This trend highlights a historical interest in UFOs among U.S. leaders.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>While there are no active investigations related to Carter's sighting, the conversation around UFOs continues to evolve, with government agencies releasing more information on unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
