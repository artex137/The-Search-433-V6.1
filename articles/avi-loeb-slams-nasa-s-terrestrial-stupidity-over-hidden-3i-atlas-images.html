      <h2>Avi Loeb Slams NASA's 'Terrestrial Stupidity' Over Hidden 3I/ATLAS Images</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a prominent astrophysicist and former chair of Harvard's astronomy department, has criticized NASA for allegedly withholding important data regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Loeb made these remarks during an appearance on the podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, expressing frustration over NASA's lack of transparency about the object's close approach to Mars.</p>

<p>Loeb's comments highlight concerns about data accessibility in the scientific community. He argues that NASA's failure to release images captured by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter prevents significant scientific progress and hampers public understanding of potential extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb has accused NASA of 'terrestrial stupidity' for withholding data.</li>
    <li>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS had a close approach to Mars.</li>
    <li>HiRISE can capture images of the Martian surface at 30 centimetres per pixel.</li>
    <li>Loeb emphasizes the need for open access to space data.</li>
    <li>He founded the Galileo Project to search for extraterrestrial technological signatures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has been vocal about transparency in scientific research, particularly regarding interstellar objects. His critical remarks about NASA's data management emerged during a recent podcast. The close approach of 3I/ATLAS to Mars has raised questions about what data NASA possesses and why it has not been released.</p>

<p>Loeb's past work includes his book, Extraterrestrial, where he posits that the first confirmed interstellar object, 1I/'Oumuamua, may have been advanced alien technology. His views often contrast with mainstream scientific perspectives.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Withholding such critical imagery does more than just stifle curiosity; it actively prevents scientific progress and damages the public's understanding of our place in the cosmos."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first instance of Loeb challenging established scientific norms. His ongoing advocacy for transparency reflects a broader debate within the scientific community about data access and the importance of collaboration in studying potential extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb continues to push for the release of HiRISE images of 3I/ATLAS, aiming to foster a more open dialogue within the scientific community. The outcome of this situation remains uncertain as discussions about data transparency and access to space research continue.</p>
