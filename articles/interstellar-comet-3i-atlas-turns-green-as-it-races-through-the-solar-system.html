      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I Atlas Turns Green as It Races Through the Solar System</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I Atlas, the third confirmed interstellar object observed, is currently passing through the solar system and has recently transformed from red to green. The comet is travelling at an estimated speed of 210,000 kilometres per hour and will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, at a distance of about 270 million kilometres.</p>

<p>This transformation is significant for astronomers, as it offers a rare opportunity to study ancient material formed outside our solar system. Authorities are monitoring the comet's trajectory and behaviour closely, as its changing colour and potential outburst could provide valuable insights into its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I Atlas discovered in late June 2023.</li>
    <li>Travelling at an estimated speed of 210,000 kilometres per hour (130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Will pass at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometres (170 million miles).</li>
    <li>Recent observations show a shift from red to green due to diatomic carbon (C2).</li>
    <li>Comet is believed to be up to seven billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I Atlas was discovered in late June 2023. It quickly gained attention as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic trajectory, which indicates it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. Observations from the Gemini South telescope in late August revealed the comet appeared red. However, recent observations from the Gemini North telescope on November 26 showed the comet has developed a bright coma emitting a green glow.</p>

<p>The green colour is a result of diatomic carbon being released as the comet heats up near the Sun. This transformation suggests that the comet is becoming more active as it approaches the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The appearance of C2 indicates that interstellar comet 3I Atlas has warmed enough to release more complex carbon-based molecules,” said an astronomer involved in monitoring the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I Atlas is only the third confirmed object of its kind, following the discovery of previous interstellar comets. Its unique trajectory and chemical composition provide scientists with an opportunity to study material that originated from outside the solar system, enhancing our understanding of the galaxy's chemical diversity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe interstellar comet 3I Atlas as it approaches Earth, particularly looking for a potential delayed outburst. This could occur as heat penetrates its interior, possibly leading to the release of additional material and an increase in brightness.</p>
