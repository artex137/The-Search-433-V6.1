      <h2>Alien Rocks Are Hitting Earth Right Now</h2>

<p>Scientists have confirmed the presence of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with observations ongoing since September 2025. The comet, which is not expected to cause injuries or fatalities, has sparked discussions among researchers regarding its origins and characteristics.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insight into the composition of interstellar bodies and their potential impact on Earth. Authorities, including astronomers from various institutions, are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and studying materials that could be linked to it.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in September 2025.</li>
    <li>Researchers are tracking its path as it nears Earth.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</li>
    <li>Harvard University has claimed some space debris may not originate from Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 2025, scientists began tracking comet 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Observations have revealed its unique characteristics, leading to debates about the nature of interstellar materials.</p>
<p>On September 26, 2025, further analysis indicated that some of the debris associated with the comet may not originate from our planet, prompting Harvard researchers to make their claims public.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The study of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS is crucial for understanding the broader universe,” said a spokesperson from the International Astronomical Union.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time scientists have studied interstellar objects. Previous incidents include the detection of 'Oumuamua in 2017, which raised questions about the nature of interstellar materials and their origins.</p>
<p>As interest in space debris and its implications grows, researchers continue to advocate for more robust monitoring systems to track such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe comet 3I/ATLAS and analyze data to better understand its composition. Further studies are expected to clarify the origins of the debris linked to the comet and its potential implications for Earth.
