      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a refined trajectory with data from the ExoMars probe on Mars</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has announced that data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) has improved the trajectory accuracy of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS by ten times. The observations took place during the first week of October as the comet passed close to Mars, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it enhances the understanding of 3I/ATLAS's path through the Solar System. ESA's Near-Earth Object Coordination Center (NEOCC) coordinated the data processing, combining records from the ExoMars TGO and ground-based telescopes for a more precise mapping of the comet's route.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Previous accuracy:</strong> approximately 1,000 km margin of error</li>
    <li><strong>Current accuracy:</strong> approximately 100 km margin of error</li>
    <li><strong>Average distance to the comet during observation:</strong> millions of kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Signals detected:</strong> Hydroxyl molecules (OH) on October 24</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> October 31</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Observers reported naked-eye visibility in dark-sky locations</li>
    <li><strong>JUICE mission:</strong> Will observe the comet until November 25</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October, the ExoMars TGO recorded multiple passes of 3I/ATLAS while adjusting its instrument parameters to account for the comet's rapid movement. On October 24, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected signals of hydroxyl molecules emitted by the comet. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 31, leading to intensified gas and dust release.</p>

<p>The JUICE mission, currently en route to Jupiter, will continue to observe the comet until November 25, providing additional data following perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The combination of observations from ExoMars and ground-based telescopes has significantly reduced uncertainties in the calculated orbit of 3I/ATLAS,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic speed indicates it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun, and its trajectory suggests it will exit the Solar System in the coming years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Data from the JUICE mission will complement the information gathered by ExoMars TGO, allowing scientists to model the evolution of cometary activity in greater detail.</p>
