      <h2>Trump says he will direct government agencies to release files related to extraterrestrial life and UFOs</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has announced that he will instruct the Pentagon and other federal agencies to release government records regarding extraterrestrial life and unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Trump made the announcement on Thursday in a post on Truth Social, stating that he aims to address the significant public interest in the topic.</p>

<p>This directive follows recent discussions about UFOs, including comments from former President Barack Obama, who hinted at the existence of extraterrestrial life during a podcast interview. The Pentagon has been expanding its efforts to investigate UFO reports through its All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office but has found no evidence of alien life, according to a report published in 2024.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump announced the directive on Thursday, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>The announcement was made via Truth Social.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon has received a total of 1,652 reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) as of 2024.</li>
    <li>Jon Kosloski is the director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.</li>
    <li>As of 2024, some UAP sightings remain unexplained, while others have been attributed to common causes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday, President Trump stated his intention to direct the Secretary of War and other relevant departments to begin identifying and releasing government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life. He emphasized the importance of these files due to the public's interest.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, former President Obama discussed the existence of aliens during a podcast, stating, “They’re real but I haven’t seen them.” Obama later clarified that he was referring to the statistical likelihood of life on other planets, not direct evidence of alien contact.</p>

<p>In 2024, the Pentagon reported that it had received 1,652 UAP sightings, with some unresolved cases requiring further investigation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life.” - President Donald Trump</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I don’t know if they’re real or not. I can tell you he gave classified information. He’s not supposed to be doing that. He made a big mistake.” - President Donald Trump, referring to Obama’s comments</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UAPs has gained considerable public attention, partly due to conspiracy theories suggesting government concealment of evidence regarding extraterrestrial life. In recent years, there have been calls for greater transparency, exemplified by a 2023 House hearing in which military veterans expressed concerns about the national security implications of UAP sightings.</p>

<p>Jon Kosloski acknowledged that some UAP cases remain unexplained, requiring additional data and analysis. He mentioned that there are cases that even he, with his background in physics and engineering, does not understand.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following Trump’s announcement, it remains to be seen when the government will begin releasing the files and what information they will contain. Further investigations into the UAP reports are expected as agencies continue to analyze the data.</p>
