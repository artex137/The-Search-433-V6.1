      <h2>NASA Offers Explanation for Fuzzy Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>NASA has addressed concerns over the low-resolution images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) on 2 October 2025. The comet, first discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, is only the third interstellar object ever observed in the solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>The release of the comet images has generated disappointment among space enthusiasts, who anticipated higher-quality visuals. NASA stated that the imaging instruments were not specifically designed for this purpose, but they captured what they could as the comet passed by. This marks a significant moment for the scientific community as it continues to study the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Images were taken on 2 October 2025 by the MRO.</li>
    <li>NASA's HiRISE camera was used to capture the images.</li>
    <li>NASA's imaging efforts faced delays due to a government shutdown.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>1 July 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered by ATLAS observatory in Chile.</p>
<p>2 October 2025: NASA's MRO captures images of the comet.</p>
<p>November 2025: NASA releases the images, which receive criticism for their quality.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Lots of reasons…but in short, it’s not what these spacecraft were designed to do. As comet 3I/ATLAS swooped by, we jumped on the opportunity to turn our instruments its way and see what we could get,” NASA stated in a social media post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The left is what it was designed to take: images of the Martian surface which is bright, close, and stable. The right is what it was able to capture of the faint, distant, fast-moving comet 3I/ATLAS. True, it’s not magazine cover material—but it is very useful scientifically!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>NASA has previously faced scrutiny over its imaging capabilities. The agency's instruments are primarily designed for Mars observations, which differ significantly from capturing distant interstellar objects. The government shutdown had also limited the agency's ability to release information and images during that period.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to release further observations and data from its spacecraft now that it is fully operational again. The scientific community will continue to analyze the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>
