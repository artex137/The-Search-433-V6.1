      <h2>Never-before-seen video shows UFO-like object absorb US Hellfire missile and vanish</h2>

<p>A video presented at a House Government Oversight subcommittee hearing on Tuesday appears to show a US military Hellfire missile striking an unidentified flying object off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. The object reportedly did not break apart upon impact and continued to fly, raising questions about its nature and potential threat to military operations in the region. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The video, recorded by an MQ-9 Reaper drone, was played by Republican Representative Eric Burlison during a session focused on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). Authorities are now examining the implications of the footage, which could impact military transparency and national security discussions. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is responsible for reviewing UAP reports and has stated that some sightings remain unexplained.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video recorded on October 30, 2024, by an MQ-9 Reaper drone.</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>Missile reportedly launched by another Reaper drone.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities reported.</li>
    <li>The footage was shown during a hearing on UAPs on November 7, 2024.</li>
    <li>The object reportedly absorbed the missile's impact.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone captured footage of a shiny, fast-moving object over the waters off Yemen. The video shows a Hellfire missile launched at the object, which reportedly continued on its trajectory after impact.</p>

<p>On November 7, 2024, during a House Government Oversight subcommittee hearing, Rep. Eric Burlison presented the footage. The session included testimony from witnesses with military experience in UAP incidents, highlighting the significance of the video.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’m not going to explain it to you, you’ll see exactly what it does,” said Rep. Eric Burlison as the video played.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is the Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bouncing right off,” said investigative journalist George Knapp.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Why are we being blocked from this information consistently?” Burlison asked.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The release of this video has drawn comparisons to a 2015 incident known as the “Go Fast” video, which also featured a fast-moving object. Analysts later determined that object was likely a weather balloon. The AARO has noted that older UAP incidents often lacked sufficient data, while newer reports captured by advanced technology provide more information for analysis.</p>

<p>Previous UAP sightings have been attributed to either natural phenomena or misidentified aircraft, but some cases remain unexplained. The Pentagon has consistently stated that there is no evidence linking UAPs to extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations by the AARO into UAP reports will continue, focusing on the implications of the newly surfaced video for military operations and national security. Further discussions on the transparency of military UAP investigations are expected to follow.</p>
