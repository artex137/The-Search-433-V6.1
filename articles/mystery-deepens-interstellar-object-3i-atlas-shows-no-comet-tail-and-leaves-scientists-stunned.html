      <h2>Mystery deepens: Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS shows no comet tail and leaves scientists stunned</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has surprised scientists after passing close to the Sun, showing no signs of a comet tail, as expected. The object was first detected entering the Solar System in June 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and the formation of interstellar objects. Astronomers are now analyzing the data and planning further observations to understand the object's behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First detected: June 2023</li>
    <li>Close pass by the Sun: Date not disclosed</li>
    <li>Next close approach to Jupiter: 16 March 2026</li>
    <li>Observation locations: R. Naves Observatory in Spain, NASA's Mars Orbiter HiRISE camera</li>
    <li>Confirmed interstellar objects: 3 (including 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in June 2023 as it entered the Solar System. Scientists expected it to produce a tail when heated by the Sun. However, recent images taken at the R. Naves Observatory revealed no visible gas or debris, contradicting typical comet behavior.</p>
<p>The object is currently on its outbound path toward Jupiter, with a close approach scheduled for 16 March 2026. NASA and the European Space Agency plan to observe it during this phase.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, stated, "The absence of a tail challenges the assumption that 3I/ATLAS is a normal comet, suggesting instead that the object might be something non-natural or artificial."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted that about 13 percent of the object's material should now be visibly dispersed, yet it remains a compact point of light.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the Solar System. The previous two, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, exhibited different behaviors. While Borisov behaved like a conventional comet, ʻOumuamua sparked debate due to its unusual acceleration and lack of visible tail.</p>
<p>The current absence of a tail in 3I/ATLAS has led some scientists to suggest it may represent a new class of interstellar object, potentially manufactured rather than formed through natural processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. They anticipate further observations that may provide insight into its behavior and characteristics, with hopes of capturing high-resolution images from NASA's Mars Orbiter once the government shutdown concludes.</p>
