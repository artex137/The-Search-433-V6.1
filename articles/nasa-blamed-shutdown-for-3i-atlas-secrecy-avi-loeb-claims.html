      <h2>NASA Blamed 'Shutdown' For 3I/ATLAS 'Secrecy,' Avi Loeb Claims</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has accused NASA of withholding high-resolution images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS following its close approach to Mars on October 2, 2025. He claims that the images are critical for understanding the object's nature, but NASA has not released them to the public, citing the ongoing U.S. government shutdown as the reason.</p>

<p>This situation highlights ongoing tensions between scientific transparency and bureaucratic processes. Loeb argues that the agency's reasoning is politically motivated and detrimental to scientific progress. He warns that the delay in releasing the HiRISE images could hinder researchers from making timely discoveries about 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a Harvard astrophysicist.</li>
    <li>The close approach of 3I/ATLAS to Mars occurred on October 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>The HiRISE camera captured the images in question.</li>
    <li>The U.S. government shutdown has lasted for 43 days as of the latest report.</li>
    <li>Nasa is expected to release the HiRISE images within a few days from November 14, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2025, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS made a close approach to Mars, during which high-resolution images were captured by the HiRISE camera. Since then, Loeb has repeatedly requested the release of these images. NASA has attributed the delay to the government shutdown, which has lasted for 43 days. Recently, Loeb revealed that multiple sources informed him of an impending release of the images, expected within days of November 14, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The HiRISE images were held hostage for bureaucratic reasons at NASA, as a result of the government shutdown for 43 days so far,” Loeb said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is excellent news,” Loeb wrote regarding the anticipated release of the images.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The controversy over the release of the HiRISE images reflects broader issues regarding scientific data accessibility and government accountability. Loeb's claims suggest a pattern where bureaucratic delays may impede scientific inquiry, particularly during significant astronomical events. Previous incidents have raised concerns about transparency within NASA and the impact of political decisions on scientific research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>With the expected release of the HiRISE images, scientists are preparing to analyze the data for insights into 3I/ATLAS. They aim to understand the object's size, shape, and tail orientation, as well as to explore any anomalies that may suggest a foreign origin. This analysis could lead to significant advancements in the study of interstellar objects.</p>
