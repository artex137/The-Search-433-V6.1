      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Observatory That First Spotted Exocomet Compares The 3 Interstellar Objects Ever To Enter Solar System</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an exocomet first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, has drawn attention as the third interstellar object to enter the solar system. The observatory operates four telescopes, including one in South Africa, one in Chile, and two in Hawaii.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it enhances understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. ATLAS is focused on detecting potentially hazardous asteroids, particularly those larger than 100 meters, which could have catastrophic consequences. The observatory's findings have sparked interest on social media and among the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> ATLAS observatory, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Nearly 60 km/second</li>
    <li><strong>Telescopes:</strong> Four, with locations in South Africa, Chile, and Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Third interstellar object, alongside 2I/Borisov and 1I/Oumuamua</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by ATLAS on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, it was temporarily listed by the Minor Planet Center on the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page. The observatory has continued to monitor the comet as it travels through the solar system.</p>
<p>The object appears to originate from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, near the Milky Way's galactic center. It displays anomalous behavior, attracting both scientific interest and public speculation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“With 3I/ATLAS hogging all the limelight while it is still cruising the solar system, it is only imperative to compare it with former visitors from interstellar space.” – University of Hawaii representative</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing body of research on interstellar objects, following the discoveries of 2I/Borisov and 1I/Oumuamua. These objects have raised questions about the nature and origins of materials from outside our solar system. The ATLAS project aims to enhance detection capabilities for potentially hazardous asteroids, given past incidents such as the 2021 Tonga volcanic eruption, which highlighted the risks posed by large celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ATLAS will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and gather data on its trajectory and behavior. Further analysis may provide insights into its origin and characteristics, contributing to the broader understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
