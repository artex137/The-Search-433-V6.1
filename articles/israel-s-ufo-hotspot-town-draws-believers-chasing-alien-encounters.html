      <h2>Israel's UFO hotspot: town draws believers chasing alien encounters</h2>

<p>The town of Kadima in Israel's Sharon region has become a modern hotspot for unexplained aerial phenomena, attracting UFO researchers and enthusiasts seeking evidence of extraterrestrial life. Reports of glowing orbs and mysterious landing circles have piqued interest, prompting investigations and tours led by local experts.</p>

<p>Authorities and researchers have noted a significant rise in UFO sightings over the years. According to veteran UFO investigator Danny Yaakov, the most active period for sightings occurred between 1993 and 1998, but reports have surged again recently. Kadima has transformed into a gathering place for those hoping to witness extraordinary phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Kadima, Sharon region, Israel</li>
    <li>Key figures: Danny Yaakov, 76, local artist and UFO researcher; Avital Bar, 55, local UFO researcher</li>
    <li>Notable sightings: Glowing orbs, landing circles, traces of unknown substances</li>
    <li>Active period for sightings: Most active between 1993 and 1998; increased reports in recent years</li>
    <li>First reported encounter: March 1992, near the home of Ziporet Carmel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 1992, Yoram Turbatian discovered a landing circle in a field after being alerted by a friend. Eyewitness Ziporet Carmel reported seeing a large glowing object and a tall figure in the area. Following this event, more landing circles appeared in Kadima.</p>

<p>In the years since, local residents have documented numerous sightings, including a large orange orb reported by Avital Bar seven years ago. Bar described the object as having hexagonal protrusions and moving at incredible speed, further fueling local interest in UFO phenomena.</p>

<p>Today, the original landing site remains unchanged and overgrown, despite significant development in the surrounding area.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Kadima Forest is a center for UFO sightings,” said Danny Yaakov. “So many people here have reported strange phenomena that it is almost impossible to ignore.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It was a large orange orb, rising slowly,” recalled Avital Bar. “Then, suddenly, boom, it shot straight up at a 90-degree angle, faster than anything I have ever seen.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Kadima's reputation as a UFO hotspot has been reinforced by decades of sightings and local lore. The area has drawn attention not only from enthusiasts but also from researchers, keen to investigate the unusual occurrences. The presence of luxury homes has changed the landscape, yet the mystery of Kadima's UFO sightings persists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Local researchers plan to continue their investigations and document further sightings. They encourage those interested in UFO phenomena to participate in night tours and meditation practices to enhance their chances of encountering unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>
