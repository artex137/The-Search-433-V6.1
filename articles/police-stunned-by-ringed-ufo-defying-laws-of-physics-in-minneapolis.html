      <h2>Police stunned by 'ringed' UFO defying laws of physics in Minneapolis</h2>

<p>Three Minneapolis police officers have reported seeing a spherical Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) with six glowing rings that changed colors while on patrol near the Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant in Minnesota in February. The officers observed the object from a parking garage, using binoculars, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting has raised significant interest among UFO researchers, particularly due to its proximity to a nuclear facility. The report has been filed with Americans for Safe Aerospace, a non-profit organization led by former US Navy pilot Ryan Graves, who advocates for transparency in UAP research. Graves shared the report on social media platform X on October 21, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in February 2025.</li>
    <li>Location: Near Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant, Minnesota.</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Three Minneapolis police officers.</li>
    <li>UAP described as hovering at 10,000 feet.</li>
    <li>Reported speeds: both slow and hypersonic.</li>
    <li>Another sighting reported on July 7, 2025, near Anoka.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In February 2025, three Minneapolis police officers spotted a UAP while on patrol. They observed the object from a parking garage and described it as having six glowing rings that changed colors. One officer attempted to approach the UAP in a squad car while the others continued to observe from their location.</p>

<p>The incident was reported to Americans for Safe Aerospace, which collects accounts from credible witnesses, including law enforcement. On July 7, 2025, another sighting of a UFO occurred near Anoka, approximately one mile from the location of the February report.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The ISS has flown over the area for the last few days and was very bright. What we see in the video could be the ISS, but we will need more details to rule it out,” said Alejandro Rojas, an advisor at Enigma Labs, regarding the sightings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The incidents were so common that pilots began discussing them as part of pre-flight safety briefings,” Graves said, emphasizing the aviation safety concerns posed by unidentified objects.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a pattern of increasing reports of UAP sightings, particularly among military and law enforcement personnel. Ryan Graves has been a prominent advocate for transparency, first drawing attention to UAP encounters involving Navy pilots off the US East Coast between 2014 and 2015.</p>

<p>Graves has indicated that these unidentified objects often appear to defy known flight physics, raising concerns about their implications for aviation safety.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Americans for Safe Aerospace plans to release additional reports on UAP sightings, as nearly 1,000 accounts have been collected. Investigations into the February and July sightings are ongoing, and further details are awaited from the witnesses and relevant authorities.</p>
