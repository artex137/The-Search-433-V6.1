      <h2>Kim Kardashian Joins Research Team Studying Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Kim Kardashian has been invited to join a research team studying the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The invitation follows Kardashian's inquiry to NASA’s acting administrator, Sean Duffy, about the comet's characteristics. The situation has raised concerns among scientists regarding access to crucial data as the government shutdown continues to affect research efforts.</p>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS, which is the third interstellar object to enter the solar system, has generated significant interest due to its unusual features and trajectory. Authorities are currently facing challenges in accessing vital data from NASA, which has captured high-resolution images of the comet but cannot release them due to the ongoing government shutdown. This has frustrated researchers who are eager to analyze the comet's anomalies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to traverse the solar system.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb invited Kim Kardashian to join his research team.</li>
    <li>NASA captured high-resolution images of the comet, but access to data is limited due to the government shutdown.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb's team is investigating the comet's unusual nickel shedding and trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early November 2025, Kim Kardashian reached out to NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, on social media, asking for insights on the comet 3I/ATLAS. Duffy responded, stating there was "no threat to life here on Earth." Following this interaction, Avi Loeb publicly invited Kardashian to join his research team.</p>
<p>As the comet approached the sun last week, it exhibited unusual maneuvers, prompting speculation about its nature. Loeb has expressed concerns about the delay in data access due to the government shutdown, emphasizing the need for timely scientific information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The dissemination of scientific information should not be held hostage to the politics of the government shutdown,” said Avi Loeb, criticizing the delay in data access.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“So is it technological? Was the trajectory designed by some intelligence?” Loeb wondered about the comet’s origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn attention due to its high nickel-iron ratio and carbon dioxide-rich gas cloud, which distinguish it from typical comets. The comet's trajectory aligns almost perfectly with the plane of the solar system's planets, a highly unlikely occurrence with just a 0.2% chance, according to Loeb.</p>
<p>Loeb's Galileo Project is dedicated to determining whether 3I/ATLAS is propelled by an internal engine or displays natural phenomena. The excitement surrounding the comet is contrasted by ongoing challenges in research access due to the government shutdown.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>With the comet's closest approach to Earth set for December 19, scientists are eager for more data to better understand 3I/ATLAS. Researchers hope to resolve the challenges posed by the government shutdown to facilitate further study of the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>
