      <h2>Big revelation on Comet 3I/ATLAS: Scientists suggest it may be older than the sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object that recently passed through our solar system, has sparked significant scientific interest after studies suggested it could be much older than the Sun, possibly dating back to the earliest days of the universe. Researchers have theorized that the comet could be as old as <strong>14 billion years</strong>, offering a rare glimpse into the early stages of star formation. This comet is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed in our solar system.</p>

<p>The findings matter because they may provide insights into the origins of solid bodies in the universe and the conditions that shaped them. Authorities, including researchers from the University of Canterbury and the University of Oxford, are continuing to analyze data from the comet to refine their understanding of its age and formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object, confirmed as the third of its kind in the solar system.</li>
    <li>It passed closest to Earth on <strong>December 19, 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>Researchers estimate its age to be between <strong>8-14 billion years</strong>.</li>
    <li>It follows a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originated outside the solar system.</li>
    <li>Its composition differs from typical solar system comets, with strong emissions of nickel and iron detected.</li>
    <li>It is unusually rich in carbon dioxide, suggesting it formed in a cold environment.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits jet-like structures and a rotation period of about <strong>15.5 hours</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed for several weeks, with its closest approach to Earth occurring on December 19, 2025. During this time, astronomers collected detailed data on its composition and activity. The comet entered the solar system at a velocity that cannot be explained solely by the Sun’s gravity, confirming its hyperbolic path.</p>

<p>Observations over 37 nights have revealed unusual physical behaviors, including jet-like structures and a stable internal structure. Researchers have utilized kinematic modeling to estimate the comet's age based on its trajectory and velocity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If confirmed, these findings imply that solid bodies formed around early-generation stars can survive for billions of years as they drift through interstellar space,” said Michele Bannister from the University of Canterbury.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Current observations are fully consistent with natural astrophysical processes,” researchers emphasized while addressing speculative theories surrounding the comet's origin.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Before 3I/ATLAS, astronomers had confirmed two interstellar objects: 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. While these objects exhibited unusual properties, neither suggested an age close to that of the universe.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS suggests that interstellar bodies may be more common than previously thought, although their detection remains challenging due to their faintness and brief visibility.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS to confirm its age and gather more insights on its composition and behavior. Once the comet departs the solar system, it is unlikely to be observed again, marking a unique opportunity for scientific discovery.</p>
