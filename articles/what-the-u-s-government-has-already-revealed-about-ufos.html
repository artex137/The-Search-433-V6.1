      <h2>What the U.S. government has already revealed about UFOs</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump's decision to release government files related to aliens and UFOs is reigniting interest in one of America's longest-running mysteries. The announcement comes in the wake of former President Barack Obama’s recent comments suggesting the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This development matters because it could potentially uncover new insights into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), which have long been a subject of speculation and investigation. Authorities are currently preparing to release additional records, as Trump has suggested that some of the information may have been classified.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Former President Obama stated that aliens are real, but later clarified he has not seen evidence of contact with Earth.</li>
    <li>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence confirmed the existence of UAPs in a 2021 report.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon has maintained that there is no evidence of alien technology or hidden government programs related to UAPs.</li>
    <li>Congress has held hearings from 2022 to 2024 to investigate UAPs and their implications for national security.</li>
    <li>NASA released a report in 2023 that found no evidence of aliens but called for further research into UAPs.</li>
    <li>California has the highest number of reported UFO sightings, totaling 17,061 as of February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, the U.S. government has taken several steps to address the issue of UFOs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence confirmed the existence of UAPs.</li>
    <li>From 2022 to 2024, Congress held hearings investigating UAPs and their implications for national security.</li>
    <li>In April 2023, Sean Kirkpatrick, director of AARO, testified about "metallic orbs" observed in many UAP sightings.</li>
    <li>In July 2023, whistleblower David Grusch claimed the government was withholding information about UAPs.</li>
    <li>NASA released a report in September 2023 stating that while there is no evidence of aliens, further research is needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have confirmed that UAPs are real, but there is no confirmation they stem from extraterrestrial origins.” – Office of the Director of National Intelligence</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Many sightings can be attributed to balloons, drones, or optical effects.” – Congressional officials during hearings</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I believe the government is withholding evidence and information about UAPs.” – Whistleblower David Grusch</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UFOs has garnered bipartisan interest in Congress due to concerns over transparency and national security. Previous reports and testimonies have suggested that many UAP sightings could be explained by conventional objects or phenomena, rather than extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAPs are ongoing, with Trump’s order to release more files potentially providing new insights into the phenomena. Further hearings and research efforts are expected as agencies continue to evaluate the implications of UAP sightings.</p>
