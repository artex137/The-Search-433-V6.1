      <h2>NASA telescope spots the building blocks for life spewing out of comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's SPHEREx space telescope has detected organic molecules emanating from comet 3I/ATLAS as it made its closest approach to Earth in December 2025. The comet, which is an interstellar visitor, did not cause any injuries or fatalities during its flyby.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insight into the building blocks of life and the composition of celestial bodies. Authorities, including NASA, are studying these findings to enhance understanding of organic materials and their potential role in the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Earth in December 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest distance to Earth was approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx observed the comet from December 8 to 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was first detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx was launched into low-Earth orbit in March 2025.</li>
    <li>Organic molecules detected include methanol, cyanide, and methane.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 while traveling at about 221,000 km/h within Jupiter’s orbit. It reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, at the end of October 2025, before making its closest approach to Earth in December.</p>

<p>The SPHEREx telescope, which launched in March 2025, observed the comet during its close flyby. The telescope's capabilities allowed researchers to collect data on the gases released from the comet's surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, after its close flyby of the Sun, causing it to significantly brighten,” said Carey Lisse, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. “We are now seeing the usual range of early solar system materials, including organic molecules, soot, and rock dust, that are typically emitted by a comet.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yoonsoo Bach, deputy study lead author at the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, noted, “Our unique space telescope is gathering unprecedented data from across the universe. But in this case, our galaxy delivered a piece of a faraway star system to us only a few months after launch, and SPHEREx was ready to observe it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar visitor detected, and it is potentially the oldest comet ever observed. The comet's origins have sparked speculation, but astronomers largely agree it is a natural celestial body from another star system. The detection of organic molecules adds to the ongoing discussion about the role of comets in the potential spread of life across the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected by SPHEREx. Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to approach Jupiter next, where NASA's Juno spacecraft will have one final opportunity to study it before the comet exits our solar system.</p>
