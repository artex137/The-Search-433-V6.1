      <h2>Mysterious UFO-shaped 'Dorito' aircraft spotted over Area 51 as strange military code is heard</h2>

<p>An unidentified flying object shaped like a 'Dorito' has been spotted over Area 51, a top-secret U.S. military base in Nevada, by explorer Anders Otteson on January 14 at around 3 a.m. local time (6 a.m. ET). Otteson, who was documenting his trip in the desert, reported seeing the aircraft after previously observing a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber in the area.</p>

<p>This sighting has drawn attention due to Area 51's long history with UFO sightings and experimental aircraft. Authorities have not disclosed any details regarding the craft, but Otteson’s video and the unusual military radio transmissions have sparked interest among UFO researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: January 14, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: Area 51, Nevada Test and Training Range</li>
    <li>Time of sighting: Approximately 3 a.m. local time</li>
    <li>Witness: Anders Otteson, explorer and videographer</li>
    <li>Previous sightings: Similar triangle-shaped aircraft reported in 2014</li>
    <li>Number of triangle-shaped UFO reports in January 2026: 10 across the U.S.</li>
    <li>Total triangle-shaped UFO reports since November 2025: 85 worldwide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At around 1 a.m. local time on January 14, Otteson filmed a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber flying over Area 51. Two hours later, he observed the unidentified Dorito-shaped aircraft performing a low flyover. The flight path of the Dorito resembled that of military aircraft, but Otteson noted significant differences in its design.</p>

<p>During the sighting, a scanner monitoring Area 51's radio frequencies picked up unusual transmissions featuring code words related to food and snacks, rather than standard military terminology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Are we looking at a classified test flight or run-of-the-mill training sortie? I certainly think we have something interesting here," Otteson said regarding the sighting.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has been associated with UFO sightings and experimental aircraft since the 1950s. The base is known for the development of advanced military technology, including the F-117 Nighthawk. Similar triangle-shaped UFO sightings have occurred in the past, with reports emerging from various locations in the U.S. and abroad.</p>

<p>According to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), triangle-shaped UFO sightings have been frequent across the United States, with 10 reported in January 2026 alone.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the recent sighting and the unusual military transmissions are ongoing. Authorities have not disclosed any plans for further inquiries or potential public disclosures regarding the incident.</p>
