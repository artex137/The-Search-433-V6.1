      <h2>Avi Loeb Says 3I/ATLAS' Sunward Jet Defies Physics After 16° Gravitational Twist</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has observed an anomaly in the behaviour of the comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traversing our solar system. Unlike typical comets, 3I/ATLAS has maintained a narrow jet pointing towards the Sun, even after its trajectory changed by 16 degrees at perihelion. Loeb has stated that this behaviour challenges existing physics and raises questions about traditional comet dynamics.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it could reshape our understanding of cometary behaviour and interstellar objects. Loeb has called for increased investment in rapid-response telescopes and missions to study such objects before they leave our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object observed in our solar system.</li>
    <li>Notable anomaly: Jet pointing towards the Sun, contrary to typical comet behaviour.</li>
    <li>Trajectory change: 16-degree shift at perihelion.</li>
    <li>Loeb has identified at least 14 anomalies linked to 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Probability of natural coincidences: as low as 0.2 percent.</li>
    <li>Expected arrival: 3I/ATLAS will make its nearest approach to Earth in the coming months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object in 2023. Since its discovery, it has exhibited unusual characteristics, including a retrograde orbit and precise alignment with the ecliptic plane. Loeb has documented these anomalies, raising concerns about their natural explanations.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers worldwide are working to gather data to better understand its nature and the implications of its behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence, but extraordinary anomalies need extraordinary concern,” said Loeb in his article.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects is still in its infancy. 1I/'Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, found in 2019, have also prompted discussions about the existence of alien technology and the limits of current astrophysical theories. These previous incidents have set a precedent for scrutiny of unusual celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory out of the solar system, astronomers aim to capture as much data as possible. The findings may influence future research and funding in the field of astrophysics and the study of interstellar objects.</p>
