      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows erupting ‘ice volcanoes’</h2>

<p>New observations have revealed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be covered in erupting “ice volcanoes.” Researchers made the discovery as the comet approached the Sun, leading to the activation of cryovolcanoes on its surface. These findings were reported in a study posted on November 24 to the preprint server arXiv, according to News.Az, citing Live Science.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it suggests that comet 3I/ATLAS shares similarities with icy trans-Neptunian objects, which are bodies that orbit the Sun beyond Neptune. If confirmed, this could change our understanding of the comet's origins, highlighting its connections to our solar system despite its interstellar background.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The study was posted on November 24, 2023.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, the comet's closest point to the Sun, occurred on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The research was conducted using the Joan Oró Telescope at the Montsec Observatory in Catalonia, Spain.</li>
    <li>Lead author is Josep Trigo-Rodríguez from the Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC/IEEC) in Spain.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever recorded.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2023. Researchers began to study the comet closely as it approached the Sun, culminating in its perihelion on October 29, 2023. The findings regarding the comet's potential cryovolcanoes were published on November 24, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We were all surprised,” said study lead author Josep Trigo-Rodríguez. “Being a comet formed in a remote planetary system, it is remarkable that the mixture of materials forming the surface of the body has resemblance with trans-Neptunian objects, bodies formed at [a] large distance from the Sun but belonging to our planetary system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, there has been considerable speculation regarding the origins of comet 3I/ATLAS. Some online theories have suggested it could be an alien spacecraft. However, most astronomers believe it is a comet from an unknown star system. The study of 3I/ATLAS offers a rare opportunity to learn about conditions around other stars and the early history of our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue studying comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the end of its journey through our solar system next year.</p>
