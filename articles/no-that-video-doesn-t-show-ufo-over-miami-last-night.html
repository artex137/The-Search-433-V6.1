      <h2>No, That Video Doesn’t Show UFO Over Miami Last Night</h2>

<p>A video circulating on social media has prompted speculation about a UFO sighting over Miami on the night of October 13, 2025. Witnesses reported seeing a slow-moving beam of light in the sky, leading some to believe it was an unidentified flying object. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The incident highlights the ongoing public fascination with unidentified aerial phenomena. Authorities have confirmed that the light was actually a rocket launched by SpaceX from Texas, which passed over South Florida shortly before the sightings were reported.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: October 13, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Miami, Florida</li>
    <li>Rocket: SpaceX Starship</li>
    <li>Launch site: Starbase, Texas</li>
    <li>Flight duration: 1 hour and 6 minutes</li>
    <li>Distance covered: From Texas to the Indian Ocean</li>
    <li>Height of rocket: 403 feet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the evening of October 13, 2025, social media users in Miami began posting videos and comments about a bright light in the sky. Many speculated that it was a UFO. Approximately 20 minutes earlier, SpaceX had launched its Starship rocket from Texas, which flew directly over South Florida.</p>
<p>SpaceX confirmed the launch on its website, stating it was the 11th flight test of the Starship. The rocket completed its trajectory in over an hour, demonstrating its capabilities for future missions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sightings were linked to the SpaceX launch, which was confirmed shortly after the reports began circulating,” said a spokesperson for SpaceX.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Rocket launches have been a common sight in South Florida for over 75 years, particularly from Cape Canaveral, located about 220 miles north of Miami. The Kennedy Space Center has hosted thousands of launches since the 1950s, contributing to the region’s identity as the “Space Coast.”</p>
<p>Despite this history, some residents expressed disbelief that the light was related to the SpaceX launch, underscoring the ongoing intrigue surrounding unidentified flying objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not announced any further investigations into the sightings, as the phenomenon has been attributed to the confirmed SpaceX rocket launch. No additional actions are expected at this time.</p>
