      <h2>UFO message ‘from humanity’s future’ waited thirty years to be read</h2>

<p>A secret code associated with a notorious UFO sighting in Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, has been made public nearly 40 years after the initial incident, which occurred on December 26 and 28, 1980. The United States Air Force (USAF) security personnel reported witnessing an orange light descending into the forest, leading to a series of investigations and claims about an alien encounter.</p>

<p>This revelation has reignited interest in the Rendlesham incident, prompting discussions among UFO enthusiasts and researchers. Authorities, including former military personnel and scholars, continue to analyze the implications of the code, which some interpret as a message from future humans.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in December 1980 in Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk.</li>
    <li>USAF security personnel reported sightings of an orange light.</li>
    <li>Lt Col Charles Halt documented the encounter in a memo to the Ministry of Defence.</li>
    <li>Sergeant James W Penniston claims to have received a telepathic code after touching the UFO.</li>
    <li>The code includes coordinates and a cryptic message, allegedly from the year 8100.</li>
    <li>John Burroughs, a USAF security policeman, witnessed a beacon and a craft with multicoloured lights.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 26 and 28, 1980, USAF security personnel reported observing an unusual orange light in Rendlesham Forest. Lt Col Charles Halt documented the incident in a memo sent to the Ministry of Defence. Sergeant James W Penniston later claimed that he had a close encounter with the unidentified craft and received a code telepathically after touching it.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 years later, Penniston has made this code public, which includes coordinates and a message that some users on Reddit interpret as communication from humanity's future. The message highlights coordinates to various locations and an origin year of 8100.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s been a crazy 40 years [since the encounter]. Just when you think the story is over, another thing happens.” - John Burroughs, USAF security policeman</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is still an element of mystery. What happened to those three guys on the first night I still find baffling. Maybe they did see something that was inexplicable.” - Dr David Clarke, journalist and scholar</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Once we had been through all the basic checks and found there was nothing seen on radar - no obvious explanation, no obvious threat to air defense - we decided no further action was needed.” - Simon Weeden, former MoD official</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Rendlesham incident is often referred to as "Britain's Roswell" due to its military involvement and the lack of conclusive explanations. The Ministry of Defence has previously released files related to the event, but the initial sightings and the subsequent claims by military personnel have remained largely unexplained.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the implications of the code and its message are ongoing. Former military personnel and researchers continue to analyze the findings, while discussions about the historical significance of the Rendlesham incident are expected to persist in UFO communities.</p>
