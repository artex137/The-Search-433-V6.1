      <h2>The Age of Disclosure Details Secret Space Race to Reverse-Engineer UFOs</h2>

<p>The documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, directed by Dan Farah, explores claims that the U.S. government has concealed the existence of extraterrestrial life and technology for the past 80 years. The film argues that U.S. officials have sought to reverse-engineer alien technology for national benefit. It has screened for members of Congress and has broken records on Prime Video.</p>

<p>This documentary is significant because it highlights ongoing discussions about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), previously known as UFOs. Farah emphasizes the importance of understanding UAP technology as a national security issue, especially in the context of global competition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Director:</strong> Dan Farah</li>
    <li><strong>Film Release:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Interviews:</strong> 34 with current and former government officials</li>
    <li><strong>Key Figures:</strong> Marco Rubio, Kirsten Gillibrand, André Carson, Mike Rounds</li>
    <li><strong>Tic Tac Incident:</strong> November 14, 2004, off the coast of San Diego</li>
    <li><strong>U.S.S. Nimitz:</strong> Nuclear aircraft carrier involved in the Tic Tac incident</li>
    <li><strong>Speed of Tic Tac UFO:</strong> 32,000 km/h</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, a crash in Roswell, New Mexico, reportedly involved a UFO and non-human bodies, according to intelligence officials interviewed by Farah. The recovered materials were said to have been taken to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio for analysis.</p>
<p>On November 14, 2004, Cmdr. David Fravor, a retired U.S. Navy fighter pilot, encountered the Tic Tac UAP during a training exercise aboard the U.S.S. Nimitz. Fravor described the object as approximately 40 feet long and capable of extreme acceleration.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If their approach to it is driven by science and a desire to match what they think is ours, we’ll wake up one day and realize, ‘I don’t know how they got there, but they got there ahead of us, and now we’re screwed,'” said Marco Rubio in the documentary.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We were unable to maintain air sovereignty over North America,” stated retired Air Force Col. James Cobb regarding an incident involving multiple pilots and a mysterious craft.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The film adds to a growing body of evidence regarding UAPs. A 2021 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence documented 18 incidents involving unusual UAP movement patterns, concluding that UAPs may pose challenges to U.S. national security.</p>
<p>Farah aims to provide a serious documentary that avoids sensationalism, focusing on credible interviews with individuals who have direct knowledge of UAPs due to their government service.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAPs continue, with calls for greater transparency from lawmakers. The White House and State Department have not responded to requests for comment on the documentary.</p>
