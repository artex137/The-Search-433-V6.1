      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-27 09:33 UTC</p>

      <h2>Thousands Of Underwater UFOs Detected Off US Coastlines: Lawmakers, Navy Officers Sound Alarm Over 'World-Changing' Phenomena</h2>

<p>Thousands of mysterious underwater objects, known as Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs), have been reported near U.S. coastlines, raising both scientific curiosity and national security concerns. The reports originate from Enigma, a UFO-tracking app that has documented over 30,000 UFO and USO sightings since its launch in 2022.</p>

<p>This surge in sightings has prompted lawmakers and military officials to express alarm over what they describe as “world-changing” phenomena. Authorities are now calling for increased scrutiny and investigation into these reports, as more than 9,000 sightings have occurred within 10 miles of U.S. shorelines, including 500 within five miles. Some claims allege that Navy personnel have witnessed crafts traveling underwater at extraordinary speeds.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Over 30,000 total UFO and USO sightings reported since 2022.</li>
    <li>More than 9,000 sightings within 10 miles of U.S. shorelines.</li>
    <li>389 underwater sightings reported in California.</li>
    <li>306 underwater sightings reported in Florida.</li>
    <li>More than 150 reports mention crafts moving above or plunging into the sea.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since the launch of the Enigma app in 2022, users have reported a significant increase in sightings of USOs. Recent discussions among lawmakers, such as Tennessee Congressman Tim Burchett, have highlighted concerns about the implications of these sightings. Burchett has stated that Navy personnel have observed underwater crafts moving at speeds far exceeding those of current naval technology.</p>

<p>In 2014, a formation off the California coast known as Sycamore Knoll garnered attention, but recent Google Earth imagery appears blurred or removed, raising further speculation about potential cover-ups.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have naval personnel telling me that they’re chasing underwater crafts doing hundreds of miles an hour. The best we’ve got does under 40. That raises a lot of questions,” said Congressman Tim Burchett.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet has urged greater attention to the rising number of credible ocean-linked UFO cases, warning that unidentified objects entering U.S. waters suggest government may be withholding information about these “all-domain anomalous phenomena.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent surge in USO sightings comes amid ongoing debates about government transparency regarding UFO investigations. Reports from Navy pilots and sonar operators have described fast-moving underwater anomalies, but no conclusive evidence has yet been released. The lack of strong responses from the Defense Department has added to speculation regarding the government's knowledge of these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to increase investigations into these USO sightings, focusing on the implications for national security and public safety. Further reports and discussions among lawmakers and military officials are anticipated as they seek to understand the nature of these underwater objects.</p>
