      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS loses typical features in new image recorded</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 A11) has exhibited significant changes in its appearance, according to a new image captured by American astrophotographer Chuck Cole on November 24, 2025. The photograph shows the comet lacking the typical features associated with active comets, such as a visible tail and a diffuse coma. The image was taken while monitoring the object’s hyperbolic trajectory, which confirms its origin outside the Solar System.</p>

<p>This observation raises questions about the comet's current behavior and activity, as the absence of visible cometary features deviates from initial expectations. Astronomers continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for further developments, which may provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects and their compositions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Photographed on: November 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Brightness: Approximately 15th magnitude</li>
    <li>Current speed: Over 60 km/s relative to the Sun</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: Exceeds 2 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Comet's trajectory: Hyperbolic with an inclination of approximately 145 degrees</li>
    <li>Discovered by: ATLAS system in January 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in January 2025 by the ATLAS system in Hawaii. Subsequent observations revealed a typical cometary structure, including a coma and tail. However, images captured in September and October 2025 indicated the onset of a weak tail and a more extensive coma. The latest image, taken on November 24, shows a drastic reduction in visible cometary activity, with no tail or symmetric coma present.</p>

<p>The comet has continued to travel through the Solar System, having passed its closest point to the Sun in October 2025. Current monitoring efforts focus on understanding the nature of its unusual behavior and activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The absence of a tail and the irregular halo raises doubts about the nucleus's current behavior,” said Chuck Cole, the astrophotographer who captured the latest images. “This appearance differs significantly from what we typically expect in active comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its passage offers a rare opportunity to study material formed in another stellar system, despite its current behavior not aligning with patterns previously observed in Solar System comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>International teams are planning new imaging sessions for December 2025 to check for possible fragmentation or a resumption of activity in 3I/ATLAS. Observations will continue to provide insights into the characteristics of this unique interstellar object.</p>
