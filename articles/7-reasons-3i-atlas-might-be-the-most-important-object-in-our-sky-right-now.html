      <h2>7 reasons 3I/ATLAS might be the most important object in our sky right now</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, has captured global attention as a significant object in our sky. It will pass Earth at a safe distance of 1.8 astronomical units (AU), or 270 million kilometres, on December 19, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This comet's unique characteristics have prompted space agencies worldwide to collaborate and share observations. Scientists are keen to study 3I/ATLAS, as it carries material from another planetary system, potentially dating back billions of years. This research aims to enhance our understanding of cosmic origins and planetary formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (270 million km).</li>
    <li>Came within 28 million km of Mars in early October 2025.</li>
    <li>Reached closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at 1.36 AU.</li>
    <li>Travels at nearly 219,000 km/h (130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>Studied by the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>Only the third confirmed interstellar object in our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. In early October 2025, it passed within 28 million km of Mars, where it was observed by orbiting spacecraft. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 AU.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2025, it is expected to pass Earth at 1.8 AU. This passage will allow scientists to study its interactions with various solar system environments.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Studying 3I/ATLAS helps scientists understand how planets and comets form around other stars, expanding our knowledge of cosmic origins and evolution,” a representative from a leading space agency stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant not only due to its interstellar origin but also because it is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicates that it is not bound to the Sun, highlighting its unique path through space.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have sparked interest in studying the composition and characteristics of materials from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, gathering data on its composition and behaviour. The collaboration between space agencies is expected to advance our understanding of interstellar objects and their implications for planetary science.</p>
