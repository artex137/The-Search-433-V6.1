      <h2>There is no evidence for extraterrestrial visitation of Earth, no pickled bodies of extraterrestrials, and no UFOs held by American companies</h2>

<p>Authorities have stated there is no evidence supporting claims of extraterrestrial visitation of Earth, following assertions made by former U.S. Air Force officer David Grusch regarding secret government programs. The claims, which have circulated in various media, include allegations of captured spacecraft and deceased alien pilots being held by private companies. These assertions have been dismissed by multiple independent experts and government agencies.</p>

<p>The significance of this matter lies in the ongoing public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the credibility of claims made by military officials. Both NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense have denied the existence of any programs related to extraterrestrial life. They assert that no evidence has been presented to support Grusch's claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of publication: January 5, 2026</li>
    <li>Key individual: David Grusch, former USAF officer</li>
    <li>Government agencies involved: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)</li>
    <li>Claims: U.S. government possesses non-human spacecraft and biological entities</li>
    <li>Expert opinions: Multiple independent experts have dismissed Grusch's claims</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2023, David Grusch testified in a Congressional hearing regarding UAPs, claiming the U.S. government has a secret program for retrieving and reverse-engineering non-human spacecraft. He stated he had spoken to over 40 witnesses who supported his assertions.</p>

<p>On July 26, 2023, during another Congressional hearing, Grusch reiterated his claims about the existence of UAPs and alleged that people had been harmed to conceal these programs. His comments have fueled ongoing discussions about UAPs in the public and media.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There are no such programs, and extraterrestrial life has yet to be discovered,” stated officials from NASA and the DoD in response to Grusch's claims.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Grusch's claims have emerged amid increasing public interest in UFOs and UAPs, particularly after the U.S. government began releasing previously classified information on the topic. The debate surrounding these phenomena has intensified, leading to Congressional hearings and media coverage.</p>

<p>Prior to Grusch's testimony, similar claims regarding government cover-ups of extraterrestrial technology have been made by various individuals. However, these claims have consistently lacked corroborating evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAPs are ongoing, with government agencies continuing to gather data and assess public interest. No specific timelines for further disclosures or investigations have been announced.</p>
