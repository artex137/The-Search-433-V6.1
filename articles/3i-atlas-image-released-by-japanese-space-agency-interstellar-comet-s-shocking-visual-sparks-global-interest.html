      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-07 20:43 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS image released by Japanese space agency sparks global interest</h2>

<p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has reportedly released a possible image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, generating significant discussion among astronomy enthusiasts worldwide. The image, claimed to be created using spectrum and imaging data, has not been officially confirmed, but it has renewed interest in the comet, which was discovered on July 1, 2025.</p>

<p>The image's release comes as scientists emphasize the importance of studying 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object classified by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). Authorities are currently assessing the authenticity of the image, which is said to provide the most realistic visual of the comet to date. The renewed attention on 3I/ATLAS highlights its unique origin and the scientific opportunities it presents for understanding celestial bodies from other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at over 210,000 kilometers per hour and has a hyperbolic orbital path.</li>
    <li>It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth was approximately 1.8 astronomical units (around 270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to be visible in the early morning sky from November to December 2025.</li>
    <li>The image's authenticity has not been verified by space authorities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA’s ATLAS telescope discovered comet 3I/ATLAS in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The comet is classified as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic orbital path, which confirms it does not circle the Sun. After its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, the comet is now moving away and is entering the visible range of the morning sky.</p>

<p>Recently, a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) claimed that JAXA had released an image of the comet, stating it was based on imagery and spectrum analysis. The post has drawn attention, though officials have yet to confirm the image’s authenticity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The 3I/ATLAS image has created wide discussion among astronomy followers and researchers. While the claim has not been officially confirmed, the image has reignited public interest in the mysterious interstellar comet.” – Not disclosed
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The letter “I” in its name signifies its interstellar nature, while the number “3” indicates its sequence of discovery. Scientists believe that interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS carry vital information about the formation of celestial bodies in distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to investigate the authenticity of the image released by JAXA. Meanwhile, astronomers and skywatchers are preparing for the comet's visibility in November and December 2025, taking advantage of this opportunity to study an interstellar object firsthand.</p>
