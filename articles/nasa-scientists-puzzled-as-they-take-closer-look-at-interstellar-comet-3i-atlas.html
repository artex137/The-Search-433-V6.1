      <h2>NASA Scientists Puzzled As They Take Closer Look At Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has released new observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object in our solar system, as it travels through space. The observations come from the James Webb Space Telescope and the SPHEREx observatory, which have provided insights into the comet's size, physical properties, and chemical makeup.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it may reveal secrets about the early universe and the evolution of celestial bodies. NASA scientists continue to study Comet 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, in October.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 3.2 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet has a coma measuring about 696,000 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>It is losing approximately 7,000 to 8,600 kilograms of material each second.</li>
    <li>The size estimates of the comet vary from 5.6 kilometres to 46 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors include 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass within the orbit of Mars during its perihelion in October.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has been monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS since it was first identified. Observations from the SPHEREx telescope were made when the comet was about 3.2 astronomical units from the Sun. The James Webb Space Telescope provided additional data on August 6, revealing the comet's activity and chemical composition.</p>
<p>As scientists analyze the findings from both telescopes, they aim to understand the comet's unusual characteristics, particularly its carbon dioxide-rich coma and the lack of a bright water gas coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The lack of a bright water gas coma is puzzling as 3I was not far outside the Solar system's 'water ice line' at 2.5au during the observations,” scientists noted in an unpublished research note.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Most likely, 3I is emitting large chunks of mixed CO2+H2O ice into its coma, where evaporative cooling of CO2 is pinning the chunks' temperature at approximately 120K and greatly suppressing the H2O ice’s vapor pressure,” the researchers added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Astronomers are particularly interested in its potential to provide insights into the conditions and materials present in the early universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion in October, gathering more data to better understand its composition and behavior.</p>
