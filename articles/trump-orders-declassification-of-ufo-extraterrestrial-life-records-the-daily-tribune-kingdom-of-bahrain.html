      <h2>Trump Orders Declassification of UFO, Extraterrestrial Life Records</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has instructed the United States Department of War and other federal departments to begin identifying and releasing government files related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life, according to a post on his social media platform on Thursday. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this announcement.</p>

<p>This directive is significant as it reflects renewed public interest in UFOs and unexplained aerial phenomena. It follows recent comments by former President Barack Obama, who suggested that extraterrestrial life is statistically likely. Officials have noted that hundreds of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) encounters have been recorded, but thorough reviews have found most observations to have earthly explanations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>President Trump made the announcement on Thursday.</li>
    <li>The directive involves the United States Department of War and other federal agencies.</li>
    <li>Trump called for the release of documents related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>Former President Obama has commented on the likelihood of extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>Hundreds of UAP encounters have been logged by military and civilian sources.</li>
    <li>There has been no confirmed proof of alien visitation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday, President Trump issued a directive to the Department of War and other federal agencies to start the process of locating and releasing UFO-related documents. This announcement followed a rise in public curiosity about UFOs, partly sparked by comments from former President Obama regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>In his social media post, Trump described the information as "highly complex, but extremely interesting and important." He accused Obama of revealing classified information, although he provided no evidence for this claim.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This issue has attracted tremendous interest,” Trump stated in his post. “I am calling on Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and other agency leaders to begin this important work.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The push for transparency on UFOs follows years of speculation and interest from the public. Military and civilian sources have reported hundreds of UAP encounters, but most have been explained as earthly phenomena. The government's willingness to release files may reflect a shift in how authorities approach national security and public interest in such topics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>While the specific material to be declassified and the timeline for publication have not been disclosed, the announcement has already reignited discussions on government secrecy and the inquiry into life beyond Earth.</p>
