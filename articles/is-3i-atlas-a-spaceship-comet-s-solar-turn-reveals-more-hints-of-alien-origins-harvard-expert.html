      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS a spaceship? Comet’s solar turn reveals more hints of alien origins: Harvard expert</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has lost a significant amount of mass after its closest approach to the Sun last month, prompting Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb to suggest that the object may have fragmented into multiple pieces. Loeb made these remarks during a phone interview with The Post on Monday evening.</p>

<p>The implications of this mass loss are significant for the scientific community. Authorities and astronomers are now closely observing 3I/ATLAS, as Loeb continues to explore the possibility of extraterrestrial origins for the comet. His recent analysis, shared in a blog post on Medium, has generated renewed interest in the object's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS made its closest pass of the Sun in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb reported that the comet may have exploded into dozens of fragments.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibited an anti-tail and a separate "smoking" trail extending up to 1,860,000 miles.</li>
    <li>Loeb calculated the absorbing area of the comet to be approximately 617 square miles.</li>
    <li>The next close approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest pass to the Sun, leading to a dramatic loss of mass. Following this perihelion, Loeb observed new images from British astronomers Michael Buechner and Frank Niebling, which showed the comet's unusual jets. On November 5, images from a Spanish observatory revealed no signs of a debris tail, contradicting expectations of a conventional cometary behavior.</p>

<p>On October 24, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected the first radio signals from 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it is losing water as it approaches the Sun. This discovery adds complexity to the ongoing analysis of the comet's nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Think of it as fireworks, resulting from the warming by the sunlight,” said Avi Loeb regarding the comet's fragmentation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “That means that maybe if it’s a natural comet, it had to break up into a lot of fragments... in order to increase the surface area to the value that you need,” Loeb explained.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the first known interstellar comets to enter our solar system. Previous studies have focused on its trajectory and composition, but Loeb's recent interpretations have sparked debate over the possibility of artificial origins. His theories challenge traditional views on cometary behavior and prompt further investigation into other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on December 19, 2025, astronomers plan to utilize ground-based telescopes, along with the Hubble and Webb space telescopes, to examine the comet's integrity and behavior more closely. These observations could provide critical insights into whether the comet is a natural object or potentially of artificial origin.</p>
