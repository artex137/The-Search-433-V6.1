      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Experiencing A Non-Gravitational Acceleration</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered five and a half months ago, is currently experiencing non-gravitational acceleration as it approaches the Sun. This comet is only the third interstellar object identified within our Solar System.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of non-gravitational acceleration has raised questions and led to misinformation about the comet's nature. Experts have clarified that this acceleration is a normal occurrence for comets, resulting from outgassing rather than any artificial propulsion. Authorities are monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely through various space agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: Approximately five and a half months ago.</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration measured at approximately half a micron per second squared.</li>
    <li>Estimated mass before close proximity to the Sun: 44 million metric tons.</li>
    <li>Estimated size of the nucleus: approximately 375 meters (1,230 feet).</li>
    <li>Observing agencies: Earth-based telescopes, Hubble, European Space Agency’s Trace Gas Orbiter, NASA’s Psyche mission.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered approximately five and a half months ago. Since its discovery, researchers have been studying its trajectory and behavior as it approaches the Sun.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, scientists have reported on the comet's non-gravitational acceleration, attributing it to outgassing as the comet heats up. The phenomenon has been observed using advanced telescopes and instruments from various space missions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Non-gravitational acceleration means that a celestial body is experiencing an acceleration that is not due to the gravitational force of other planetary bodies or the Sun,” experts have stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Despite a coma that stretches over 100,000 kilometers, the nucleus of comets is often much smaller, leading to complex dynamics,” researchers noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects passing through our Solar System. The study of such comets helps scientists understand the dynamics of celestial bodies and the processes that occur as they approach the Sun.</p>
<p>Previous claims regarding the comet's behavior have sparked speculation about its nature, including unfounded theories of it being a disguised spacecraft. Experts have emphasized that these claims are not supported by scientific evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it progresses on its trajectory. Further studies may provide additional insights into its composition and behavior during its approach to the Sun.</p>
