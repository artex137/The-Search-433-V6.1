      <h2>Top military and intelligence officials 'to release evidence of UFOs' in 2026</h2>

<p>Top military and intelligence officials in the United States could disclose evidence related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in 2026, according to recent reports. This speculation has emerged amid new threats from whistleblowers and political pressures aimed at increasing transparency around unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>The potential for disclosure matters as it may reveal decades of government secrecy regarding UFOs. Authorities are currently reviewing how information about these phenomena has been archived and classified. The push for transparency gained momentum following the November 2025 release of the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, which features numerous current and former officials suggesting a cover-up.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Potential disclosure date: 2026</li>
  <li>Documentary: <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> released in November 2025</li>
  <li>Key figures: 34 current and former US government officials featured</li>
  <li>Legislation: FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act mandates review of UAP encounters since 2004</li>
  <li>Whistleblower: David Grusch, former US Air Force intelligence officer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2025, the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> was released, featuring testimonies from military and intelligence officials about UFOs. This film has brought renewed attention to the issue and has placed pressure on President Donald Trump to fulfill his promise of declassifying information regarding unexplained aerial activities.</p>
<p>The FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act has called for a comprehensive review of UAP encounters dating back to 2004, focusing on the potential over-classification of relevant materials. This legislative push aims to ensure that Congress is briefed on significant UAP intercepts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities - and it’s not ours,” said Secretary of State Marco Rubio in <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee noted, “2026 stands out because of escalating congressional momentum, whistleblower activity, and cultural shifts that are building unstoppable pressure on government secrecy.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Helen McCaw, a former Bank of England analyst, warned that “UAP disclosure is likely to induce ontological shock. There might be extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this potential disclosure, the topic of UFOs has been shrouded in secrecy for decades, with many former officials claiming the existence of undisclosed programs aimed at recovering and reverse-engineering crashed UFOs. The momentum for transparency has been increasing, partly due to public interest and whistleblower revelations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations continue, the legislative push for disclosure is intensifying. Key provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act are set to mandate the Pentagon’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office to provide Congress with updates on UAP encounters, potentially leading to significant revelations in 2026.</p>
