      <h2>3I/ATLAS shines brighter and bluer during its approach to perihelion</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has exhibited a rapid increase in brightness and a shift to a bluer hue as it approaches perihelion, according to a study published by researchers Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams. Harvard physicist Avi Loeb revealed these findings in an article on Medium on October 30, 2025, highlighting observations made in September and October 2025.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances the scientific community's understanding of 3I/ATLAS, which is currently not visible from Earth due to its position behind the Sun following a solar conjunction on October 21, 2025. Advanced space-based instruments have continued to monitor its trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently behind the Sun, hidden from terrestrial telescopes.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted in September and October 2025.</li>
    <li>Instruments used include STEREO-A, SOHO’s LASCO, and GOES-19’s CCOR-1.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS displayed a 300,000-kilometer-long glow detected by CCOR-1.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to be visible again from Earth in December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 21, 2025, 3I/ATLAS underwent solar conjunction and became hidden from view on Earth. Researchers utilized various space-based instruments to track the object during September and October 2025.</p>
<p>The study reported a significant increase in brightness, with 3I/ATLAS appearing bluer than the Sun. This marked a notable change from earlier observations that showed a red hue.</p>
<p>Following perihelion, 3I/ATLAS is expected to re-emerge in the twilight sky, allowing for further observations from ground-based facilities and space telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations were made by two cameras, HI1 and COR2, on the SECCHI instrument suite,” Loeb said, emphasizing the technological advancements that facilitated these findings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The new data suggests that 3I/ATLAS shines brighter and bluer during its approach to perihelion,” Loeb pointed out, noting the unusual characteristics of the interstellar object.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The reason behind the rapid brightening of 3I/ATLAS remains unclear,” the authors of the research paper stated, indicating the need for further investigation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations of 3I/ATLAS indicated a red coloration, contrasting with the latest findings of a bluer hue. This shift has prompted researchers to explore the underlying causes of the changes in brightness and color as the object approaches perihelion.</p>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader interest in interstellar objects, which have become increasingly significant in astronomical research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth in December 2025, ground-based observations and data from the Hubble and Webb space telescopes are expected to provide deeper insights into the interstellar object.</p>
