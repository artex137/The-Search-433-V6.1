      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on December 19 and intrigues astronomers with chemical anomalies</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object detected in July 2025, will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19 at a distance of 270 million kilometers. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers, as it offers a rare opportunity to study the comet's unusual composition, which includes a higher concentration of nickel compared to iron and notable carbon dioxide emissions. Space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have mobilized resources for intense observations of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 270 million kilometers from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 61 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Mass:</strong> 33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated age:</strong> Over 7 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> 20-30 kilometers in diameter</li>
    <li><strong>Detection:</strong> July 1, 2025, by Telescópio ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>International collaboration:</strong> Involves NASA, ESA, and CNSA</li>
    <li><strong>IAWN campaign duration:</strong> November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Telescópio ATLAS in Río Hurtado, Chile. The comet was identified as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originated from another star system.</p>

<p>In November 2025, observations from the Hubble Space Telescope revealed a significant presence of nickel on the comet's surface, diverging from typical cometary compositions. The James Webb Space Telescope confirmed a CO₂-dominated coma during this period.</p>

<p>As December approached, astronomers observed luminous pulsations every 16.16 hours, suggesting the comet's nucleus was rotating and ejecting ice. The comet will pass 28 million kilometers from Mars in October 2025, with its trajectory confirmed to be safe for Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unique composition of 3I/ATLAS presents an exciting opportunity for us to learn more about the building blocks of our solar system,” said Nicola Fox from NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are coordinating our efforts to ensure we capture as much data as possible during its approach,” said a spokesperson from ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet's unusual features have sparked debates among astronomers regarding its origin and composition. Some experts, like astrophysicist Avi Loeb, suggest the possibility of technological origins, while others view the anomalies as results of improved detection methods.</p>

<p>The IAWN (International Asteroid Warning Network) emphasizes the scientific value of this approach, highlighting no threat to Earth. The ongoing collaboration among NASA, ESA, and CNSA aims to refine tracking techniques for similar objects in the future.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will continue to adjust their observation schedules to optimize data collection. The IAWN campaign will run until January 27, 2026, as scientists analyze the comet's characteristics and prepare for its exit from the solar system in early 2026.</p>
