      <h2>3I/ATLAS Becomes New Interstellar Visitor for European Space Agency</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been confirmed as the latest interstellar visitor to our solar system, having been discovered by the ATLAS system in Chile on July 1, 2025. The European Space Agency (ESA) is currently studying this comet, which scientists have described as a "time capsule" containing material older than our sun.</p>

<p>This discovery highlights the potential frequency of interstellar objects entering our solar system. Authorities, including international research teams led by Spanish scientist Xabier Pérez Couto from CITIC at the University of A Coruña, are analyzing the comet's trajectory and characteristics using data from ESA's Gaia mission.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>Travels at a speed between 58 and 61 km/s (over 200,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Estimated age between 7 and 10 billion years.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth will be 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Passed close to Mars in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Scheduled to pass close to Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
    <li>Maximum brightness around magnitude 12, visible to amateur telescopes.</li>
    <li>Expected to reappear in early December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in Chile by the ATLAS system. Since then, international teams have worked to confirm its interstellar status and reconstruct its trajectory over the past 10 million years. In October 2025, the comet passed close to Mars, and it is set to make a near approach to Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This comet is a fragment of material that is even older than our own sun,” said Xabier Pérez Couto, emphasizing its significance as a time capsule.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar visitors, including ‘Oumuamua, which was noted for its elongated, rock-like appearance. In contrast, 3I/ATLAS exhibits typical cometary features, such as a tail of gas and dust. Its unusual chemical composition suggests it formed as part of a planet in another region of the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor the trajectory and characteristics of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026. Further studies will focus on its unique composition and implications for understanding the formation of celestial bodies in the universe.</p>
