      <h2>New Video Captured By Citizen-Astronomer Shows 3I/ATLAS Violating Known Comet Physics</h2>

<p>A high-resolution video recorded by independent astronomer Ray, known online as @Raysastrophoto1, has shown unusual jet activity from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, raising questions about its classification as a comet. The video, which documents real-time behavior of the object, was released following its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges established cometary physics, prompting scientists to reassess the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities have noted that the behavior displayed in the video contradicts expected cometary outgassing patterns, suggesting that further investigation is warranted.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Video captured by: Ray (@Raysastrophoto1)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Key observations: Continuous jet activity, presence of nickel gas</li>
    <li>Reported anomalies: Non-synchronized emissions, absence of iron signatures</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2023, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth. Following this event, independent astronomer Ray released a video documenting the object's unusual behavior, which contradicts standard comet physics. The video shows multiple jet streams ejecting from the object, maintaining coherence and changing orientation as it rotates.</p>
<p>Previously, observations had noted non-gravitational acceleration and anti-tail structures associated with 3I/ATLAS. These findings, combined with the new video evidence, suggest a pattern that does not align with typical cometary behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When multiple anomalies persist across independent measurements, the correct response is deeper investigation.” — Avi Loeb, Harvard University</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident aligns with ongoing discussions in the scientific community regarding the classification of interstellar objects. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has emphasized the need for careful scrutiny when an object displays multiple violations of expected behavior.</p>
<p>In the past, similar anomalies have prompted investigations into the nature of interstellar objects, particularly those exhibiting unusual acceleration or structural features.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the video and additional data from the December 19 encounter are pending. Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to better understand its behavior and the implications for planetary defense.</p>
