      <h2>Australia caves show 'UFO-shaped' drawings 40,000 years ago</h2>

<p>Australia’s cave art, some of the oldest in the world, has revealed images resembling UFOs, according to research published in the Australian Archaeology journal. The findings, which include the Maliwawa Figures in Arnhem Land and the Kimberley, date back more than 40,000 years and provide insights into early human creativity and culture.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it sheds light on the storytelling and cultural practices of ancient peoples. Researchers, led by Professor Paul Taçon from Griffith University, have documented 572 previously unknown images that span from 6,000 to 9,400 years ago. Authorities and scholars are now focused on preserving these significant cultural artifacts amidst threats from climate change and erosion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Research published in the <strong>Australian Archaeology</strong> journal.</li>
    <li>Study led by Professor <strong>Paul Taçon</strong>, Chair in Rock Art Research at <strong>Griffith University</strong>.</li>
    <li>572 previously unknown images documented, dating from <strong>6,000 to 9,400 years ago</strong>.</li>
    <li>Surveyed <strong>87 sites</strong> across northwest Arnhem Land from <strong>2008 to 2018</strong>.</li>
    <li>Oldest known rock art in Australia is a <strong>17,300-year-old</strong> painting of a kangaroo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between 2008 and 2018, researchers surveyed 87 sites across northwest Arnhem Land, documenting various artworks. The Maliwawa Figures, which include large and realistic images, were found during this survey.</p>
<p>Recent findings indicate that some cave art features shapes resembling UFOs, linked to the Wandjina in Aboriginal culture, which has sparked interest among researchers and UFO enthusiasts alike.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These images are often seen as representations of ancestral spirits or sky beings important in Aboriginal Dreamtime stories,” said Professor Taçon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The need for action is urgent, and the responsibility to protect these treasures has never been greater,” stated a conservation expert.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discoveries of ancient rock art in Australia have highlighted the cultural significance of animals like kangaroos, which are frequently depicted. The oldest known kangaroo painting, dated at 17,300 years, showcases the importance of these animals in Aboriginal culture.</p>
<p>Modern threats to rock art include erosion, climate change, and land disputes, particularly evident in the case of the Murujuga cave art.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers continue to advocate for the preservation of these ancient artworks, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding Australia’s cultural heritage for future generations.</p>
