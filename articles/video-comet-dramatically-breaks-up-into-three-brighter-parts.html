      <h2>Video: Comet dramatically breaks up into three brighter parts</h2>

<p>NASA has released images of Comet ATLAS (C2025 K1), which has been observed breaking up into at least three brighter fragments since November 12, 2025. The comet, discovered on May 24, is currently visible in the constellation Ursa Major, according to SkyLive.</p>

<p>The breakup of Comet ATLAS is significant for astronomers as it provides insight into the composition and behavior of comets. Observations of this event have garnered attention from both amateur and professional astronomers, highlighting the unique golden hue of this comet compared to others typically seen in blue and green tones.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet ATLAS (C2025 K1) was discovered on May 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has been breaking into fragments since November 12, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is currently moving through the constellation Ursa Major.</li>
    <li>The brightness of Comet ATLAS is at magnitude 10, visible with a normal backyard telescope.</li>
    <li>Photographer Michael Jäger created an animation depicting the comet's breakup over several dates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 12, 2025, Comet ATLAS began to break apart into multiple fragments. Observations continued on November 14, 18, 19, and 20, capturing the comet's dramatic transformation. Various astronomers, including Michael Jäger and Gianluca Masi, have documented the event through photographs and animations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The main component and 'fragment B' are the two brightest parts of the comet,” said Nick James, director of the comet section at the British Astronomical Association.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Comet ATLAS is probably lacking in carbon-bearing molecules, which has resulted in its golden colour,” stated Dr. David Schleicher of Lowell Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet ATLAS is one of the few comets to exhibit a golden hue, a characteristic attributed to its unique composition. This phenomenon contrasts with most comets that typically appear blue or green due to the presence of gases like di-carbon and cyanide. The comet's breakup has sparked interest in studying its material properties and behavior in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet ATLAS as it moves through the constellation Ursa Major. Further observations are expected to provide more data on its fragments and overall behavior in the coming weeks.</p>
