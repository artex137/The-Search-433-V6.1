      <h2>Christian Influencer Claims UFOs Are Demonic as 'Sigil' Evidence Faces Serious Scrutiny</h2>

<p>A Christian influencer's assertion that UFOs are demonic due to alleged occult sigils has ignited a heated debate online. Nathaniel Gillis, a religious demonologist, claims that markings associated with unidentified aerial phenomena indicate a satanic nature. His theory has gained traction, prompting discussions among believers, sceptics, and researchers.</p>

<p>The controversy raises questions about the interpretation of symbols linked to UFO sightings and the nature of evidence in such claims. Critics argue that the alleged sigils are often ambiguous and do not meet the definition of occult symbols. As the debate unfolds, researchers and skeptics continue to scrutinize the evidence presented by Gillis and others.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Claimant:</strong> Nathaniel Gillis, religious demonologist</li>
    <li><strong>Claims:</strong> UFOs are demonic due to occult sigils</li>
    <li><strong>Notable case:</strong> Rendlesham Forest incident, UK</li>
    <li><strong>Criticism:</strong> Evidence of sigils is often ambiguous or misidentified</li>
    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Anecdotal stories shared on Christian podcasts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Nathaniel Gillis has built a following by linking unidentified aerial phenomena to spiritual warfare. His arguments have circulated widely on social media, prompting discussions about the nature of symbols associated with UFO sightings. Critics have responded by highlighting the lack of clear examples of actual occult sigils in well-documented cases.</p>

<p>Key incidents cited by Gillis include the Rendlesham Forest incident and the Zamora incident in New Mexico. However, researchers argue that the symbols identified in these cases often resemble coded languages or abstract shapes rather than traditional sigils used in occult practices.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The leap from similarity to demonic intent is where many believe Gillis' argument collapses,” said a researcher familiar with the debate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Most claims rely on anecdotal stories shared on Christian podcasts rather than physical evidence,” noted a critic of the theory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discourse surrounding UFOs and their alleged ties to occult practices has a long history. Various sightings have sparked speculation about the nature of unidentified aerial phenomena and their possible connections to spiritual beliefs. However, many researchers emphasize that parallels between UFO encounters and occult practices do not constitute proof of demonic intent.</p>

<p>Many observers suggest that the ongoing controversy reflects deeper belief systems and fears surrounding the unknown, rather than providing concrete evidence of the claims being made.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the debate continues, researchers and skeptics are expected to further investigate the claims made by Gillis and others. The push for concrete evidence of occult sigils in relation to UFO phenomena remains a focal point of discussion in the community.</p>
