      <h2>NASA press conference shares new data on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA held a press conference on November 19, 2025, to release new data on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. The event followed delays caused by the U.S. government shutdown. Harvard Professor Avi Loeb attended the conference and reported that NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet.</p>

<p>The press conference provided images and measurements from various telescopes, including HiRISE, MAVEN, Hubble, Webb, and SPHEREx. Loeb stated that the findings largely reinforced existing observations, and no significant revisions were made to previous data. He emphasized the importance of quantitative analysis of the new data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of press conference: November 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: NASA</li>
    <li>Key participant: Harvard Professor Avi Loeb</li>
    <li>Image captured by HiRISE on October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Upcoming closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Observations from multiple telescopes: HiRISE, MAVEN, Hubble, Webb, SPHEREx</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured an image of 3I/ATLAS. The image displayed a diffuse light signature consistent with previous observations. Following this, on October 29, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to the Sun, leading to amateur astronomers capturing images of tightly collimated jets extending approximately a million kilometers.</p>

<p>During the press conference on November 19, NASA officials reported that 3I/ATLAS exhibits typical comet behaviors, including shedding gas and dust. Loeb noted that the comet's mass is significantly larger than that of previous interstellar objects, indicating a "mass anomaly."</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA will repeat the official mantra that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet and that they were unable to process the data until this week because of the government shutdown.” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the coming days I will analyze this data quantitatively to extract the most important information out of it.” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS does what comets do, namely shed gas and dust and responds to gravity.” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This press conference follows previous observations of interstellar objects, with 3I/ATLAS being noted for its unusual mass and trajectory alignment. The findings presented by NASA reaffirm the characteristics typical of comets, which have been subjects of interest in the study of interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Upcoming observations from larger ground-based telescopes, along with Hubble and Webb instruments, are expected to provide further insights into the composition and behavior of the jets from 3I/ATLAS. The closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, will also offer additional opportunities for data collection and analysis.</p>
