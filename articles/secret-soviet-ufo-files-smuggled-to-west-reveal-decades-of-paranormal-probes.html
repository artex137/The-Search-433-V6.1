      <h2>Secret Soviet UFO Files Smuggled to West Reveal Decades of Paranormal Probes</h2>

<p>On February 8, 2026, a trove of classified documents detailing Soviet investigations into Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) has been made public, exposing decades of secretive research by the Soviet Union. The documents, which were brought to the West in 1993 by investigative reporter George Knapp, challenge the Soviet government's previous dismissal of UFOs as American propaganda.</p>

<p>This release matters as it provides unprecedented insight into the Soviet Union’s serious approach to the UFO phenomenon, which included multiple official programs and thousands of reports. Authorities and researchers are now examining the implications of these findings on historical understandings of global government involvement in UFO studies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of document release: February 8, 2026</li>
    <li>Initial smuggling of documents: 1993</li>
    <li>Key figure: George Knapp, investigative reporter</li>
    <li>Soviet UFO programs included: Network-AN (1979), Galaxy-MD (1981-1985), Pluton 7 (1989-1990), Thread 3 (ongoing)</li>
    <li>Notable incident: Petrozavodsk Phenomenon, February 13, 1989</li>
    <li>Witnesses of Petrozavodsk: military personnel, airport staff, and astronomers</li>
    <li>Documented case: Anatoly Malishev, July 1975</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The investigations into UFOs by the Soviet Union began with the launch of the “Network-AN” program in 1979. This was followed by “Galaxy-MD,” which ran from 1981 to 1985. The “Pluton 7” initiative took place in 1989 and 1990, and the “Thread 3” program is still ongoing.</p>
<p>On February 13, 1989, the Petrozavodsk Phenomenon occurred, with hundreds of witnesses reporting a jellyfish-shaped object hovering over Nalchik. The event lasted approximately ten minutes, culminating in the appearance of a massive craft.</p>
<p>In July 1975, Anatoly Malishev claimed to have been abducted while sketching near Blagoveshenka. He described being taken to a distant planet and examined by humanoid beings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The files demonstrate how seriously Russia confronted the UFO phenomenon,” said Jeremy Corbell, Knapp’s podcast partner and an investigative journalist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this release, the Soviet government publicly dismissed UFO sightings as fabrications by “American imperialists” as early as 1953. The newly released documents indicate that despite this public stance, significant resources were allocated to investigate UFO reports.</p>
<p>The files contain numerous witness testimonies and abduction accounts that investigators deemed credible, suggesting a long-standing interest in the phenomenon by Soviet authorities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigators and researchers are expected to further analyze the released documents to understand the full extent of Soviet involvement in UFO research and its implications on Cold War policies. Further studies and discussions around these findings are anticipated in the coming months.</p>
