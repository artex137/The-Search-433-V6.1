      <h2>Up next on Congress’ transparency list: UFOs</h2>

<p>Members of Congress have held a hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), commonly referred to as UFOs, on Tuesday, September 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Testimonies from military witnesses have detailed encounters with these phenomena, including a triangular craft observed by former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist Dylan Borland in 2012.</p>

<p>This hearing, organized by the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, is part of ongoing efforts to address national security concerns related to UAPs. Lawmakers are pushing for stronger whistleblower protections for individuals reporting encounters and demanding transparency from the government regarding UAP investigations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Capitol Visitor Center, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Witness: Dylan Borland, former U.S. Air Force geospatial intelligence specialist</li>
    <li>Key testimony: Encounter with a triangular craft in 2012</li>
    <li>Chair of the task force: Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.)</li>
    <li>Legislation reintroduced by: Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2012, Dylan Borland observed a triangular craft while stationed at Langley Air Force Base. The craft approached him silently and disappeared after hovering above him. In 2023, David Grusch, a former military intelligence officer, testified that the government had recovered “non-human” biologics. The Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets has met multiple times this Congress to discuss UAPs and related topics.</p>

<p>On September 9, 2025, Borland and other witnesses testified about their experiences with UAPs, highlighting a culture of fear that discourages reporting within the intelligence community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Today, I want to state clearly: This is not science fiction or creating speculation. This is about national security, government accountability and the American people’s right to the truth.” - Rep. Anna Paulina Luna</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I don’t really know what is true. I don’t know on this subject. But I do know when we’re being lied to, and we are definitely being lied to.” - Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“What we’re trying to get to is total disclosure. The government has something, and they need to turn it over to us.” - Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.)</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Reports of UAPs have surfaced for decades, often dismissed or inadequately investigated. The recent testimonies have reignited discussions about the government's handling of UAP information and the need for improved transparency and accountability. Past hearings have drawn significant public interest, leading to calls for more rigorous investigations into these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets will continue to investigate UAPs and is expected to consider new legislation aimed at protecting whistleblowers who report on UAP encounters. Further hearings are anticipated as lawmakers seek to enhance transparency surrounding UAP research and findings.</p>
