      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth with unusual characteristic</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers. No injuries or fatalities have been reported as a result of the comet's approach, which poses no risk to the planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers and space agencies, as 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed object to originate from outside the Solar System. Observations have revealed a rare feature known as an anti-tail, which points toward the Sun. Ground and space telescopes continue to monitor the comet's activity as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The minimum distance to Earth will be around 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It is expected to meet Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
    <li>The core of the comet is estimated to be between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was identified on July 1, 2025, by telescopes from the ATLAS project. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory indicated its interstellar origin. Following its discovery, it passed close to Mars in October and reached perihelion on October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>Recent images captured in December 2025 have shown the comet's distinct anti-tail, a feature that differs from conventional tails. Ground-based telescopes in Thailand and Italy have confirmed its persistence after perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anti-tail phenomenon may result from larger dust particles that are less affected by solar radiation,” said astronomers from UCLA and the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Astronomer Avi Loeb of Harvard stated, “While I keep options open, including non-natural origins, additional data is necessary to draw definitive conclusions.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is compared to previous interstellar objects like ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, which have provided insights into the composition and behavior of materials from other star systems. These studies help enhance the understanding of planetary formation in distant environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring of 3I/ATLAS will continue until the comet leaves the Solar System. Astronomers are gathering data to further analyze the comet's unique characteristics and behavior.</p>
