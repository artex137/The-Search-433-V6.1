      <h2>Goodbye, 3I/ATLAS: Object Won't Be Visible Again Until Early December</h2>

<p>A mysterious object from interstellar space, 3I/ATLAS, is currently making its closest approach to the Sun today, 29 October 2025. The object is at its perihelion, approximately 1.36 Astronomical Units (AU) or 203 million kilometres from the Sun, but it is hidden from Earth's view and will not be observable for weeks.</p>

<p>This event is significant as Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS may not be a typical comet. He proposes this fly-by could reveal the object’s true nature, potentially even leading to the release of what he calls "mini-probes" around Christmas. NASA has stated that the object will reappear on the other side of the Sun by early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of perihelion:</strong> 29 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Time of perihelion:</strong> 11:47 Universal Time (UT)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 1.36 AU (203 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Predicted closest approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 267 million kilometres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Today, 3I/ATLAS reaches its perihelion, marking a critical point in its journey through the Solar System. According to Loeb, this moment could reveal whether the object behaves like a natural comet or exhibits technological characteristics.</p>

<p>On 19 December 2025, 3I/ATLAS will come closest to Earth, just six days before Christmas. Loeb has indicated that this date is crucial for monitoring any potential 'gifts' from the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If it is a natural comet glued together by weak forces, its heating by 770 watts per square meter may break it up into fragments,” said Avi Loeb, discussing the possible outcomes for 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “In the coming months, it will come closest to Earth on December 19th, just six days before Christmas,” Loeb stated in a recent interview, expressing his hopes regarding the object's behavior.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has previously claimed that 3I/ATLAS could be an 'alien mothership' based on its composition, which he argues includes a high abundance of nickel relative to iron. His theories have sparked controversy and debate within the scientific community regarding the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>Loeb has also initiated the Galileo Project, which aims to monitor unusual activity in Earth's atmosphere. This research is intended to prepare for any potential anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS completes its perihelion behind the Sun, scientists will continue to monitor the object. The key date to watch is 19 December 2025, when the object will make its closest approach to Earth. Researchers are preparing to examine any unusual activity that may arise during this time.</p>
