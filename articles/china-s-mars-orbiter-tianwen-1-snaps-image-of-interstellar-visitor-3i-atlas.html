      <h2>China’s Mars orbiter Tianwen-1 snaps image of interstellar visitor 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>China’s Mars orbiter Tianwen-1 has captured images of the interstellar object designated 3I/Atlas from a distance of approximately 30 million km on October 3. The object has sparked scientific debate regarding its origins, with claims that it may be a comet or an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>This observation marks a significant moment in astronomical studies, as 3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar object detected entering our solar system. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has released images that provide a closer look at the presumed comet, which was first identified on July 1 by the Nasa-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of images captured:</strong> October 3</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> 30 million km (18.6 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Initial discovery:</strong> July 1 in Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated speed upon discovery:</strong> 221,000 km/h (137,323 mph)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated nucleus diameter:</strong> 440 metres (1,444 feet) to 5.6 km (3.5 miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Tianwen-1 launch date:</strong> July 2020</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile. Nasa confirmed the object as interstellar based on its hyperbolic orbit. On October 3, Tianwen-1 captured images of 3I/Atlas, marking the first time the orbiter photographed a distant object significantly dimmer than its primary targets on Mars.</p>
<p>The CNSA began preparations to study the object in early September, addressing challenges related to its speed and distance. The images have been processed for further analysis of the object’s trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The images clearly show the distinctive features of a comet, consisting of a nucleus and a surrounding coma, with a diameter reaching several thousand kilometres,” the CNSA stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It has some interesting properties that are a little bit different from our solar system comets, but it behaves like a comet. And so the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It’s a comet,” said Tom Statler, Nasa’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/Atlas, only two other interstellar objects have been detected entering our solar system. The characteristics of 3I/Atlas have led to discussions about its potential origins, with some researchers exploring the hypothesis that it could be of technological origin. However, the prevailing view among scientists is that it is a natural interstellar object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Tianwen-1 team will continue to analyze the images and data collected from 3I/Atlas. Further studies will focus on the object’s trajectory and other features, as researchers aim to deepen their understanding of this interstellar visitor.</p>
