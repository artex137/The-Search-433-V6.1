      <h2>NASA Stirs Up Curiosity by Deploying Planetary Defenses for a Celestial Object</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense tools for Comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently not posing any threat to Earth. The announcement was made on October 21, 2025, at 21:08 UT, following the comet's unusual behavior, according to NASA's technical notice in the MPEC (2025-U142) bulletin.</p>

<p>This activation is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third object identified from outside the Solar System. Authorities are conducting a comet observation campaign to enhance monitoring and improve precision in astrometry measurements for the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered as the third object from outside the Solar System.</li>
    <li>NASA issued a technical notice on October 21, 2025, at 21:08 UT.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth will be approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 167 million miles).</li>
    <li>The perihelion is expected on October 30, 2025, at around 1.4 astronomical units (about 130 million miles).</li>
    <li>The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, reported the comet's observation.</li>
    <li>The observation campaign will run from November 21, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 21, 2025, NASA issued a technical notice regarding Comet 3I/ATLAS, citing its unexplained behavior and the activation of planetary defense protocols. The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Río Hurtado, Chile, was the first to observe the comet, prompting the announcement of an observation campaign by the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN). The campaign is set to begin on November 21, 2025, and will last until January 27, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The announcement of the IAWN Comet Astrometry Campaign will focus on comet 3I/ATLAS, enabling the scientific community to obtain precise astrometry of the meteor,” stated the International Astronomical Union.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this, NASA has engaged in various planetary defense measures, primarily focused on asteroids. The challenges in measuring comets have been noted, as their morphological characteristics can affect precision in trajectory estimates. This campaign aims to address these challenges through improved observation techniques.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The observation campaign for Comet 3I/ATLAS will begin on November 21, 2025, as planned. Authorities will continue to monitor the comet's behavior and prepare for the upcoming perihelion on October 30, 2025.</p>
