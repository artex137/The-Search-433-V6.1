      <h2>Hubble's New 3I/ATLAS 'Double Jet' Discovery Baffles NASA — Here's Why</h2>

<p>NASA scientists have encountered unexpected findings after the Hubble Space Telescope observed interstellar object 3I/ATLAS releasing two distinct jets of material as it moves away from the Sun. The latest images were captured on 12 and 27 December 2025, following the object's closest approach to the Sun in late October 2025, when activity was expected to diminish.</p>

<p>This discovery has prompted researchers to reassess how rare interstellar visitors behave after departing the inner solar system. Scientists are now examining the implications of this unusual activity and how it challenges existing comet models.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Dates:</strong> 12 December 2025 and 27 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Solar Approach:</strong> Late October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Instrument Used:</strong> Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3</li>
    <li><strong>Key Observations:</strong> Two distinct jets; one stronger jet directed towards the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Researcher:</strong> Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 21 July 2025, Hubble's earlier images hinted at unusual behaviour from 3I/ATLAS, revealing a sunward jet with significant dimensions and a wobble. By late October 2025, the object had passed its closest approach to the Sun, leading to expectations of reduced activity.</p>
<p>However, on 12 and 27 December 2025, Hubble captured images showing two persistent jets, contradicting the anticipated decline in activity. These observations indicated a structured double-jet pattern, prompting further investigation from NASA and astrophysicists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The images showed a surprisingly structured scene," highlighting the clear double-jet pattern observed in the data.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Typically, scientists expect comet-like objects to vent material primarily from sunlit regions, while shaded areas show minimal activity. This unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS challenges established models, as the weaker jet appears from a section that should be darkened after perihelion. The observed jets are stable and narrow, indicating a more complex internal structure than previously understood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>To resolve the mystery of 3I/ATLAS's jets, scientists plan to gather spectroscopic data and detailed measurements of jet velocities. Continued monitoring of brightness changes is also necessary. Facilities such as the Keck Observatory and the Very Large Telescope are expected to contribute to this ongoing investigation.</p>
