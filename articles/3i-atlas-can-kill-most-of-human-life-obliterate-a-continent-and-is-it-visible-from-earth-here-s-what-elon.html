      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Discussed by Elon Musk on Joe Rogan's Podcast</h2>

<p>Elon Musk has discussed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, highlighting its potential risks and unusual characteristics. The conversation took place recently, with no injuries or fatalities reported related to the comet.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its composition and trajectory. Authorities, including NASA, have stated that the comet poses no threat to Earth. However, Musk's comments have sparked public interest and concern regarding its potential impact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Classified as an interstellar comet, it travels on a hyperbolic trajectory outside the solar system.</li>
    <li>Composed mostly of nickel, with a nucleus estimated to be a few kilometres across.</li>
    <li>Visible from Earth only with a medium to large telescope; not visible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) expected in late October 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025. Since then, scientists have studied its unusual behaviour and composition. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun in late October 2025, after which it will become visible in the predawn sky in early November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It could obliterate a continent, maybe worse,” Musk said, discussing the potential impact of 3I/ATLAS. “It’s a real problem if it hits,” Rogan added, emphasizing the possible scale of destruction.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 2I/Borisov and 1I/‘Oumuamua. Its discovery provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study materials from outside our solar system. The comet's unusual high carbon dioxide content and other chemical properties have raised questions about its origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, astronomers will monitor its trajectory and behaviour. Future observations will help scientists better understand the composition and dynamics of interstellar objects.</p>
