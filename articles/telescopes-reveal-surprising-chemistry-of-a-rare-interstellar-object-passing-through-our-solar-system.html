      <h2>Telescopes Reveal Surprising Chemistry of a Rare Interstellar Object Passing Through Our Solar System</h2>

<p>New observations have shown that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS contains significant amounts of carbon dioxide and nickel. Detected on July 1, 2023, by a telescope in the Rio Hurtado Valley of Chile, this rare comet is the third known object to originate from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>The findings are significant as they may provide insights into the environments where 3I/ATLAS formed and evolved. Astronomers worldwide have conducted follow-up observations to understand the object's unusual composition and trajectory, which indicates it is moving too fast to be in orbit around the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object detected on July 1, 2023, by a 20-inch telescope in Rio Hurtado Valley, Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever discovered.</li>
    <li>It is currently 3.3 astronomical units from the sun.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, or closest approach to the sun, is expected around October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>Observed velocity of 3I/ATLAS is approximately 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Findings submitted as preprint papers to the arXiv platform.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, a 20-inch telescope in Chile detected 3I/ATLAS during a routine survey. Within a day, astronomers confirmed its interstellar trajectory. Follow-up observations began shortly after, with various telescopes, including the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, collecting data about the object's composition.</p>

<p>As of now, 3I/ATLAS has shown surprising activity at a distance of 3.3 astronomical units from the sun. The object will reach perihelion on October 30, after which it will continue its journey back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We just cracked open the door to a whole new world of chemistry that we never had access to before,” said Thomas Puzia, an astronomer at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Its CO2-to-water ratio in the coma … is among the highest ever seen in any comet,” stated Martin Cordiner, an astronomer at the Catholic University of America and principal investigator of the JWST observations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique among interstellar objects, exhibiting a high nickel content without accompanying iron, a phenomenon not previously observed. The findings suggest that it may have traveled through various space environments over billions of years, potentially altering its chemical makeup.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar objects, 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, did not display such rich chemical diversity, making 3I/ATLAS a key subject for further study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun. The activity level is expected to increase, particularly with the sublimation of water ice. Observations will focus on understanding its origins and the implications for interstellar chemistry.</p>
