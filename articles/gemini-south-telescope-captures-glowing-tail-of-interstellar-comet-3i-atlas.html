      <h2>Gemini South Telescope Captures Glowing Tail of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, as it moves through the solar system, leaving behind a glowing tail. The Gemini South telescope in Chile reported significant changes in the comet's tail on August 27, 2023, indicating increased activity as it approaches the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it contributes to the understanding of interstellar objects within our solar system. Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar objects identified, following comet Oumuamua in 2017 and comet Borisov in 2019. Scientists are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and plan further observations when it reappears in December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is over <strong>19 kilometers</strong> wide and moving at <strong>210,000 km/h</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet will come within <strong>130 million miles</strong> of the sun on <strong>October 30, 2023</strong>.</li>
    <li>Observations began on <strong>July 2023</strong>, when it was confirmed as an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>The comet's tail has been described as "significantly more extended" than previous images showed.</li>
    <li>NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) is monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope provided early observations in <strong>July 2023</strong>.</li>
    <li>The James Webb Space Telescope conducted imaging on <strong>August 6, 2023</strong>.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx telescope observed the comet from <strong>August 7 to August 15, 2023</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was confirmed as an interstellar object. Initially thought to be an asteroid, it was reported to the Minor Planet Center. Subsequent observations established its interstellar origins.</p>
<p>On August 6, the James Webb Space Telescope provided imaging data. Observations from SPHEREx followed from August 7 to August 15, enhancing the understanding of the comet’s physical properties.</p>
<p>On August 27, the Gemini South telescope reported the tail's significant expansion, indicating increased activity as the comet approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The tail of 3I/ATLAS has shown significant growth, revealing its increasing activity as it journeys through the inner solar system,” said an astronomer involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of only three confirmed interstellar objects detected in the solar system, highlighting the rarity of such events. The previous two, comet Oumuamua and comet Borisov, were also notable for their unique characteristics and origins from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS, with further observations planned for December 2023 as it reappears. These studies aim to provide insights into the formation of comets and the early solar system.</p>
