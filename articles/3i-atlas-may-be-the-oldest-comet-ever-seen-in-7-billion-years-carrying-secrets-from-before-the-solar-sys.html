      <h2>3I/ATLAS may be the oldest comet ever seen in 7 billion years, carrying secrets from before the solar system</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered an ancient interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS, which may be the oldest comet ever observed, originating more than seven billion years ago. The object was detected on July 1, 2025, by a research team from the University of Oxford using the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS could significantly enhance our understanding of comet formation and the early galaxy. According to Dr. Matthew Hopkins, the object’s unique composition and trajectory may provide crucial insights into the conditions that existed before the formation of our solar system. The findings were presented at the Royal Astronomical Society’s National Astronomy Meeting 2025 in Durham.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Sun at Detection:</strong> Approximately 670 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Likely from the Milky Way's thick disk</li>
    <li><strong>Potential Age:</strong> More than 7 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>First Detected By:</strong> University of Oxford’s research team</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. The object was approximately 670 million kilometres from the Sun and travelling on a steep orbit. Following its detection, Dr. Matthew Hopkins applied a statistical model to analyze the comet’s characteristics, suggesting it formed around ancient stars in the galaxy's thick disk.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists expect it will become more active, exhibiting typical comet behavior such as producing a coma and tail due to sublimation of its icy surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All comets within our solar system, such as Halley’s, formed about 4.5 billion years ago. But interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS may have formed long before that, potentially making this the oldest comet ever observed,” said Dr. Matthew Hopkins.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is an object from a part of the galaxy we’ve never seen up close before. There’s a two-thirds chance this comet is older than the solar system itself, a true relic from our galaxy’s distant past,” said Professor Chris Lintott, co-author of the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is only the third instance of an interstellar object being identified within our solar system, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike these predecessors, 3I/ATLAS is thought to originate from a different region of the Milky Way, which could provide new perspectives on the evolution of comets and their roles in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, astronomers plan to monitor its activity closely. Initial observations have shown signs of activity, and further studies will focus on the gases it releases. The discovery has sparked interest in the potential for more interstellar objects to be identified, especially with the upcoming operations of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</p>
