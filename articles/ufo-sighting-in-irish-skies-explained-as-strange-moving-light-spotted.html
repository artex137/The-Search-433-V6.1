      <h2>UFO sighting in Irish skies explained as ‘strange moving light’ spotted</h2>

<p>A strange moving white light was spotted in the skies over Ireland on the night of October 29, 2025. Reports of the unidentified flying object (UFO) came from several counties, including Carlow, Cork, Donegal, and Wexford. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The sighting has drawn significant attention, leading to speculation about extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including weather experts, have investigated the reports and identified the source of the light. Alan O'Reilly, a weather expert from Carlow, played a key role in clarifying the situation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Reports received from Carlow, Cork, Donegal, and Wexford</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Multiple individuals reported seeing the light</li>
    <li>Identified source: SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket</li>
    <li>Flight path: Falcon 9 was in low Earth orbit, circling the Earth every 90 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the evening of October 29, 2025, reports of a strange light in the sky began to emerge from various locations across Ireland. Alan O'Reilly shared these reports on social media, noting the unusual nature of the sightings.</p>

<p>As interest grew, O'Reilly posted a follow-up, revealing that the light was caused by the Falcon 9 rocket. He explained that the white object was the result of fuel being dumped by the rocket, which froze and reflected light in the atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Multiple reports of strange light moving in sky over Ireland in last 15 minutes with some describing as a big object with light in front but no noise and moving very quickly,” said Alan O'Reilly. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “For those that were looking last night at the sky, we can say now that the UFO was identified as Falcon 9,” O'Reilly added. “It was the second part dumping fuel that freezes and the crystals then reflect the light.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The term UFO simply refers to an unidentified flying object, which does not necessarily imply extraterrestrial activity. Previous sightings of unusual lights in the sky have often been attributed to natural phenomena or man-made objects. The Falcon 9 rocket, developed by SpaceX, has been responsible for several such sightings since its introduction.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor the skies for unusual activity, but no further action is expected following the identification of the Falcon 9 rocket as the source of the recent sightings.</p>
