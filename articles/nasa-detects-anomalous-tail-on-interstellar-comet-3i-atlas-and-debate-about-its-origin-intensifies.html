      <h2>NASA detects anomalous tail on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS and debate about its origin intensifies</h2>

<p>NASA has announced the detection of an unusual structure on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS astronomical survey system. The detection was made public on November 5, 2025, and has sparked significant debate within the astronomical community about the comet's composition and origin. The comet is currently traveling at extreme speeds, raising questions about the formation of celestial bodies in other stellar systems.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it confirms that 3I/ATLAS did not originate within our Solar System, allowing scientists to study material from another star. Observatories worldwide have focused on the comet since its identification, with initial analyses indicating atypical behavior. Recent observations have revealed details that challenge conventional explanations, prompting a race to uncover its secrets before it moves out of reach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA announced the detection of its unusual tail on November 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet approaches the Sun at approximately 56,000 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>It passed its closest approach to Earth on October 29, 2025, at a distance of about 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has lost around 13% of its mass during its perihelion passage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 by the ATLAS astronomical survey. On October 29, 2025, the comet reached its closest point to Earth, allowing for critical data collection. NASA announced the detection of its anomalous tail on November 5, 2025, leading to increased interest and research into its characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The structural peculiarity suggests that the comet’s nucleus may be fragmenting in an atypical way or that its interaction with the interplanetary environment is more complex than previously assumed,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS marks a new era in astronomy, emphasizing the study of interstellar objects. Previous interstellar visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have shown varied characteristics, but 3I/ATLAS exhibits unique features that may indicate a greater diversity of celestial bodies in other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue over the coming months as it journeys back into interstellar space. Missions like SOHO and STEREO-A will monitor its interaction with the solar wind, providing additional data that may help reveal more about its fundamental nature.</p>
