<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On March 13, 1997, at approximately 8 p.m., witnesses across several states reported a V-shaped formation of glowing orbs in the sky. Half an hour later, another set of orbs appeared before disappearing.</p>

<p>On September 16, 1994, during a recess at Ariel School in Zimbabwe, around 60 children observed a silvery disc and claimed to have seen aliens emerge from it. Investigations followed, including interviews with the students by a UFO expert and a Harvard professor.</p>

<p>In Voronezh, Russia, on September 27, 1989, several witnesses saw a glowing disc land in a park. Reports described the beings as over 9 feet tall with green skin and three eyes. Soviet media covered the incident extensively, revealing traces of radiation at the landing site.</p>

<p>In Michigan, from March 14 to March 20, 1966, numerous UFO reports flooded police departments in Ann Arbor and nearby areas. The sightings involved disc-shaped objects with lights, leading to investigations by the Civil Defense and the U.S. Air Force.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is something. We just can’t put our finger on it. We've been investigating this for quite a while.”</blockquote>
<p>- Douglas Harvey, former Washtenaw sheriff, recalling a conversation with Dr. J. Allen Hynek.</p>
