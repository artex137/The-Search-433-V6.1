      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS mystery solved: Astronomers detect first radio signal revealing its origins</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected the first-ever radio signal from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, confirming its identity as a natural comet and not an alien probe. The finding was made using South Africa’s MeerKAT radio telescope as the object reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it settles debates regarding the true nature and origin of 3I/ATLAS, which was first observed in July 2025. Researchers have identified the radio signal as natural emissions from hydroxyl radicals in the comet’s coma, providing concrete evidence of its cometary behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First observed: July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: More than 130,000 miles per hour (210,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Location of detection: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li>Key finding: Natural radio emissions confirming cometary activity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025, marking it as the third interstellar object detected in our solar system. As it approached the Sun on October 29, 2025, astronomers at the MeerKAT radio telescope detected a faint radio signal. This signal was linked to hydroxyl radicals produced by the comet, confirming its identity as a comet rather than an artificial object.</p>

<p>Prior to this detection, speculation about its origins had circulated, especially regarding the possibility of it being an extraterrestrial probe, similar to the discussions surrounding the earlier object 'Oumuamua in 2017.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, acknowledged the detection of hydroxyl radicals but refrained from calling it proof of cometary behaviour. He stated, "The radio signature is exactly what we’d expect from a water-rich comet."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Researchers involved in the study emphasized, "It tells us that this object is behaving in a completely natural way — there’s nothing alien about it."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS contributes to a growing body of evidence surrounding interstellar objects. Similar claims of alien technology were made regarding 'Oumuamua, but detailed scientific analysis has consistently provided natural explanations for such phenomena. The study of these objects enhances our understanding of the chemical composition and formation of planetary systems across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS and similar interstellar objects using advanced telescopes like MeerKAT and NASA’s upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). These studies aim to uncover more about the chemical fingerprints of distant planetary systems.</p>
