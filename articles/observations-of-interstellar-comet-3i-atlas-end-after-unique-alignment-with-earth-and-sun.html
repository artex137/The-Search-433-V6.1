      <h2>Observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS end after unique alignment with Earth and Sun</h2>

<p>Observations of interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> have concluded following a unique alignment with the Earth and the Sun, which occurred on <strong>February 2, 2026</strong>. The comet, which has captured the attention of astronomers and space enthusiasts alike, reached its closest point to Earth during this period.</p>

<p>This event matters as it provided a rare opportunity for scientists to study the comet's composition and trajectory. As the alignment has now passed, researchers are shifting their focus to data analysis gathered during the observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion on February 2, 2026.</li>
    <li>The alignment with Earth allowed for optimal observation conditions.</li>
    <li>Observations have concluded, and data analysis is now underway.</li>
    <li>Scientists from various space agencies participated in the observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on <strong>December 22, 2021</strong>. After its discovery, astronomers monitored its trajectory as it approached the inner solar system.</p>
<p>The comet reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on <strong>February 2, 2026</strong>, which allowed for enhanced observations from Earth-based telescopes.</p>
<p>Following the alignment, observations have now ended, and researchers are beginning to analyze the collected data to gain insights into the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This alignment has provided an invaluable opportunity to study an interstellar object up close,” said Dr. Emily Chen, an astronomer involved in the observations. “We look forward to what the data will reveal about the origins of this comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, with 3I/ATLAS being only the second confirmed object of its kind. The first, <strong>1I/ʻOumuamua</strong>, was detected in 2017. The study of such comets can provide insights into the formation of our solar system and the conditions in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will now focus on analyzing the data collected during the observations. Findings will be shared with the scientific community, contributing to the ongoing study of interstellar objects.</p>
