      <h2>Exact date interstellar visitor will reveal itself as 'alien mothership' or comet confirmed</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS is set to reveal its true nature as it approaches the sun on October 29, 2025. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has stated that if 3I/ATLAS is a comet, it is expected to disintegrate into fragments during this close encounter. The European Space Agency's (ESA) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will observe the event from a distance of approximately 125 million miles from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it could provide insight into the origins of 3I/ATLAS, which has sparked debate over whether it is a natural comet or a man-made object. Authorities, including the ESA, are preparing to monitor the object closely during its approach and subsequent observations in November and December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 125 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Agency:</strong> European Space Agency (ESA)</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Period:</strong> November and December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Professor Involved:</strong> Avi Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Chance of Non-Natural Origin:</strong> 30% to 40%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been on a trajectory through the Solar System since its discovery. Key events leading up to its close approach include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery of 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Announcement of its close approach to the sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>ESA's Juice spacecraft scheduled to monitor the object during its closest approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "When a comet gets close to the sun, solar radiation heats its icy nucleus. Volatile ices like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, or water sublimate directly into gas, carrying away dust and small rocks."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "There is a 30 to 40 percent chance the object does not have a fully natural origin," suggesting it could act as a "Trojan Horse."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The object 3I/ATLAS has generated interest since its discovery as the first interstellar visitor to enter our Solar System. Previous interstellar objects have prompted discussions about their origins and potential implications for understanding extraterrestrial life and technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the sun, astronomers and scientists will conduct observations to determine whether it disintegrates like a typical comet or releases mini-probes, as suggested by some theories. Further updates will follow as the event unfolds.</p>
