      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-10 05:30 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: 1 in a 100 million chance interstellar object is a natural comet</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown unusual features, including jets and a peculiar tail, since its observation began in July. The latest images, captured on November 9, reveal jets shooting towards the Sun, a behavior not typical for regular comets. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about interstellar objects. Researchers are now studying the comet to understand its mass, which has been estimated at over 50 billion tons by Harvard scientist Avi Loeb. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS could reshape the understanding of comet formation and behavior in our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First observed: July 2023</li>
    <li>Latest images captured: November 9, 2023</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: over 50 billion tons</li>
    <li>Diameter: above 10 kilometres</li>
    <li>Probability of being a natural comet: 1 in 100 million</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2023. Since then, scientists have noted its peculiar behavior, including the formation of a strange tail and jets. Recent images taken on November 9, 2023, have further baffled researchers, showing jets directed towards the Sun, which is not typical for comets.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has provided estimates regarding the mass of 3I/ATLAS and its likelihood of being a natural comet, stating that its retrograde trajectory aligns with the ecliptic plane at a low probability.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "An object with a diameter above 10 kilometres entering our solar system can only happen once per ten thousand years or longer." He also mentioned, "The probability of the retrograde trajectory of 3I/ATLAS being aligned to within 5 degrees with the ecliptic plane is 0.2%."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed in recent years, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua. The study of these objects is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of our solar system and the dynamics of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS to gain insights into its composition and behavior. Further observations and studies are expected as the comet approaches the Sun.</p>
