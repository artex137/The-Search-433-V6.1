      <h2>UFO witness tells Congress of terrifying 'glowing red square'</h2>

<p>A former US Air Force veteran, Jeffrey Nuccetelli, has appeared before Congress today to share his experiences with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during two separate encounters in California in the early 2000s. Nuccetelli reported that these incidents began in October 2003, when contractors observed a "massive glowing red square silently hovering" above missile defense sites. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these sightings.</p>

<p>This testimony is significant as it adds to the ongoing discussion about UFOs, now officially referred to as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities are currently reviewing such reports to better understand these occurrences and their implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Witness: Jeffrey Nuccetelli, former US Air Force veteran</li>
    <li>Location: California</li>
    <li>Incident dates: October 2003</li>
    <li>Type of sighting: "Massive glowing red square" hovering above missile defense sites</li>
    <li>Response from other witnesses: Reports of alarm and disbelief</li>
    <li>Government suppression: Other veterans claim they were unable to share their experiences due to government actions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2003, Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Boeing contractors observed a large, glowing red square above missile defense sites in California. As the object moved, witnesses expressed alarm, exclaiming, "It's coming right at us!" and "Now it's here!" Nuccetelli's testimony highlights a pattern of similar experiences among other US veterans who have recently come forward.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It's coming right at us! It's coming right for us!” - Jeffrey Nuccetelli, describing the reaction of witnesses during the sighting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Now it's here!” - Witness response during the encounter, as recounted by Nuccetelli.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This testimony comes amid a broader trend of increasing transparency regarding UAP sightings. The US government has faced scrutiny over its handling of such reports, with many veterans claiming they were previously silenced. Nuccetelli's experience adds to a growing body of evidence that challenges the narrative surrounding UFOs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue its investigation into UAP sightings and the government's response. Further testimonies from other veterans may also be forthcoming as more individuals share their experiences.</p>
