      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS isn’t alien tech — scientists debunk viral claims</h2>

<p>Conspiracy theories have circulated online about Comet 3I/ATLAS, claiming it has “changed color” or serves as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Astronomers have refuted these claims, asserting that they are unfounded.</p>

<p>The significance of this matter lies in the potential for misinformation to spread, especially when it originates from credible figures. Authorities, including astronomers and researchers, are working to clarify the comet's characteristics and its natural phenomena, aiming to counter the viral claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the third known object from outside our solar system to pass through it.</li>
    <li>The comet approached the sun on October 30, 2023, traveling at nearly 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>NASA has not yet released new images due to reduced operations during the recent U.S. government shutdown.</li>
    <li>The closest pass by Earth is expected on December 19, 2023, at a distance of about 167 million miles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The perceived color change of Comet 3I/ATLAS began weeks before its closest approach to the sun. Early September observations indicated a bluish-green hue, which is typical for comets.</p>
<p>As the comet neared the sun, its gas coma brightened unexpectedly. Initial images suggested a reddish tint, but later analyses confirmed it was “distinctly bluer than the sun.”</p>
<p>These observations have been interpreted as a natural result of the comet heating up and releasing more gas, rather than a transformation or sign of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We don’t have any evidence for the gas coma changing colors,” said astronomer Qicheng Zhang of Arizona’s Lowell Observatory, who coauthored a preprint study on the comet. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “A large fraction of the misinformation I’ve seen can be directly traced back to him misinterpreting or not fully reading the data,” Zhang said, referring to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I hope people start to see how the anomalies of this comet are just weird things comets do,” Zhang added. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader study of interstellar objects, which have become a focus of scientific inquiry. This comet’s observations have drawn attention due to its unique characteristics and the public's fascination with space phenomena.</p>
<p>Previous incidents of misinformation related to space events have prompted scientists to emphasize the importance of accurate communication in the field of astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers anticipate more images of Comet 3I/ATLAS will be released soon, including those from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter taken in early October. Scientists continue to encourage public interest in understanding the natural behaviors of comets.</p>
