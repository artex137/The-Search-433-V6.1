      <h2>3I/ATLAS 'Not Firing Jets' But Holds 'Exotic Chemistry,' Astronomer Claims</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, has drawn significant attention from scientists after Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb claimed it does not exhibit traditional cometary jets. The object is currently being monitored by astronomers worldwide as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<p>This claim raises questions about the object's origin and nature. Authorities and researchers are conducting further analysis to understand its chemical composition and behavior, which may not align with conventional comet characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has been observed to lack a classical comet tail.</li>
    <li>The object has a carbon-dioxide-to-water ratio of roughly 8:1, one of the highest recorded for a comet.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has stated that the object may not be a naturally occurring comet.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Researchers are using the James Webb Space Telescope for infrared spectroscopy analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar visitor and has since been the focus of various studies. Recent analyses have shown unusual movement patterns and chemical signatures. Observations have indicated that the object may have spent millions of years traveling through interstellar space before being captured by the Sun's gravity. Ongoing studies aim to monitor its behavior as it exits the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "If 3I/ATLAS fails to produce a cometary tail, it is likely not a naturally occurring comet."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also mentioned, "It's easy to test whether 3I/ATLAS is natural or technological by measuring the outflow velocity, mass flux and composition of its jets during the coming month."</blockquote>
<blockquote>British astrophysicist Brian Cox described the speculation around alien technology as "drivel," asserting that the object is "entirely natural in origin ... a visitor from elsewhere in the galaxy."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects studied by astronomers. Previous incidents have shown that such objects can exhibit atypical behaviors, prompting ongoing debates about their origins. The scientific community largely agrees that while anomalies exist, they do not necessarily indicate artificial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun, observing changes in its outgassing and chemical profile. The goal is to gather more data that could clarify the object's nature and confirm its classification as a comet or another type of celestial body.</p>
