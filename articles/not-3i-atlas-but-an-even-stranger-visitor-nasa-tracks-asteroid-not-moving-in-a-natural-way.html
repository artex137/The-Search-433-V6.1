      <h2>NASA Tracks Unusual Asteroid 2025 OW</h2>
<p>NASA has tracked an asteroid, designated 2025 OW, that is moving in an unconventional manner, according to the agency. The asteroid, which measures approximately 61 metres in diameter, was first discovered on July 4, 2025, by the Pan-STARRS2 telescope in Hawaii.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges long-held beliefs about asteroid behaviour. NASA is conducting further analysis to understand the asteroid's unique rotational characteristics and its implications for similar near-Earth objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Asteroid Name:</strong> 2025 OW</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 61 metres wide</li>
    <li><strong>Date Discovered:</strong> July 4, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Location:</strong> Pan-STARRS2 telescope, Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Rotation Period:</strong> 1.5 to 3 minutes</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 1.6 times the distance between Earth and the Moon</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Method:</strong> Radar scans from NASA’s Goldstone Deep Space Network</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>2025 OW was discovered on July 4, 2025, by the Pan-STARRS2 telescope in Hawaii. Initial observations classified it as a typical asteroid. However, subsequent radar scans from NASA’s Goldstone Deep Space Network revealed that it has an exceptionally fast rotation period and an unusual trajectory influenced by sunlight.</p>
<p>NASA has begun tracking the asteroid's position to gather data for future predictions and potential deflection measures.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The behaviour of 2025 OW defies the traditional classification of asteroids," a NASA spokesperson said. "This is the first documented asteroid that spins at such high speeds without disintegrating."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Asteroids have traditionally been viewed as stable bodies following predictable paths in space. However, advancements in technology have revealed that factors such as sunlight and thermal radiation can affect their rotation and trajectory. Recent studies indicate that these forces may even lead to an asteroid breaking apart if sufficient.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 2025 OW to refine predictions about its path and gather valuable data on near-Earth objects. This information will aid in developing potential deflection strategies should they be necessary in the future.</p>
