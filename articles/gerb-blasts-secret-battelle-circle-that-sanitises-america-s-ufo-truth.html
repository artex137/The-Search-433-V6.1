      <h2>Gerb Blasts Secret Battelle Circle That 'Sanitises' America's UFO Truth</h2>

<p>A high-profile UAP whistleblower known as Gerb has claimed that a Battelle-linked job carousel is shielding alien secrets from the American public. His allegations place the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) at the centre of a hidden network controlling information about unidentified aerial phenomena. The claims were made during a recent interview, though the specific date and location were not disclosed.</p>

<p>Gerb's assertions raise concerns about transparency and accountability regarding UAP investigations. Authorities are now examining the implications of his claims, particularly the relationship between government agencies and defence contractors involved in UAP research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Gerb claims Battelle operates a closed system that controls UAP information.</li>
    <li>A metallic object recovered in 2024 from private land in Ohio has been linked to AARO.</li>
    <li>AARO suggested the object was likely ordinary, which Gerb described as politically convenient.</li>
    <li>Gerb alleges a "revolving door" of personnel between Battelle, Oak Ridge, and AARO.</li>
    <li>Former Undersecretary of Defence Ronald Moultrie has been accused of obscuring conflicts of interest.</li>
    <li>Debates continue over the authenticity of whistleblowers and their potential roles as tools of the intelligence community.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2024, a metallic object recovered from private land in Ohio was handed to Oak Ridge National Laboratory for analysis. Witnesses reported that its properties did not match known earthly alloys. AARO subsequently received the case, which is meant to investigate such materials. Within months, AARO issued a statement suggesting the object was likely ordinary, prompting criticism from Gerb.</p>

<p>Gerb has since highlighted connections between senior officials, contractors, and scientists in a network he describes as a "cosy club." His allegations suggest that personnel frequently rotate between Battelle, Oak Ridge, and AARO, which he argues compromises the integrity of UAP investigations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Battelle-linked job carousel is not accidental, it is structural, and it keeps real UAP knowledge locked inside a closed elite circle.” - Gerb</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Extraordinary claims still require extraordinary evidence.” - Critic</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Gerb's claims come amid ongoing debates about the credibility of AARO and the role of defence contractors in UAP research. Former figures from the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) have supported elements of whistleblower accounts, complicating the narrative surrounding UAP investigations. Critics argue that while job mobility is common in science and defence, the implications in the UAP field are particularly concerning due to the potential for non-human technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ongoing investigation into Gerb's claims may prompt further scrutiny of the relationships between government agencies and defence contractors. Authorities are expected to continue assessing the implications of these allegations and their impact on public trust in UAP research.</p>
