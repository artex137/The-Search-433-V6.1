      <h2>Filmmaker claims Vatican is bracing for alien contact in 2026</h2>

<p>A British filmmaker has claimed that the Vatican may be preparing for potential contact with extraterrestrial life in 2026. Mark Christopher Lee, a UFO researcher, has reportedly received rare access to the Vatican’s secret archives to investigate historical references to unexplained phenomena. His findings could influence how the Catholic Church responds if humanity is not alone in the universe.</p>

<p>This claim raises significant questions about the Church's stance on the existence of life beyond Earth. Authorities within the Vatican have not disclosed any official plans related to these investigations, but Lee emphasizes that the new Pope could face unprecedented challenges regarding potential disclosure of non-human intelligence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee has gained access to the Vatican’s secret archives.</li>
    <li>Lee is examining historical references to unexplained phenomena and spiritual encounters.</li>
    <li>He believes that 2026 could be a pivotal year for humanity regarding disclosure of intelligent life beyond Earth.</li>
    <li>Past comments from the Vatican suggest that belief in God does not conflict with the existence of extraterrestrial life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee has begun his investigation into the Vatican's archives, focusing on past reports of UFOs and supernatural experiences. He has stated that he intends to explore how the Church views potential encounters with non-human intelligence.</p>

<p>In 2008, Father Gabriel Funes expressed that the existence of intelligent beings created by God would not contradict the Catholic faith, suggesting that the Church may have been open to the idea of extraterrestrial life for some time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’ve been given rare access to the Vatican’s secret archives. I’ll be looking for any historical references to unexplained phenomena, spiritual encounters, or anything that could shed light on humanity’s possible contact with intelligent life beyond Earth,” said Mark Christopher Lee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The new Pope could become the first spiritual leader in history to address First Contact, and I intend to find out how prepared the Church really is,” Lee added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“To quote St. Francis, if we can consider some earthly creatures as ‘brothers’ or ‘sisters’, why could we not speak of a ‘brother alien’? He would also belong to the creation,” said Father Gabriel Funes.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Vatican has a history of discussing the intersection of faith and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. In 2008, Father Gabriel Funes articulated that the existence of intelligent beings created by God would not contradict Catholic doctrine. This perspective indicates a longstanding openness within the Church to consider life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>Lee's documentary, God Vs Aliens, connects UFO sightings with spiritual experiences, suggesting that the Church may be more receptive to the idea of extraterrestrial life than commonly perceived.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lee plans to continue his investigation into the Vatican archives. The findings could have significant implications for the Catholic Church if humanity makes contact with extraterrestrial life in the near future.</p>
