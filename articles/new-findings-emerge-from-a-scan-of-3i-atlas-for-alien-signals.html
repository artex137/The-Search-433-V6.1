      <h2>New findings emerge from a scan of 3I/ATLAS for alien signals</h2>

<p>Researchers have reported new findings regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, suggesting no evidence of alien signals. The study, conducted by a team of scientists using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, took place on December 18, 2025, a day before the comet's closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>The Breakthrough Listen program's recent paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, indicates that 3I/ATLAS exhibited typical cometary behavior and no signs of technosignatures. This contrasts with earlier speculation from Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who has suggested the comet could have alien origins. However, even Loeb has moderated his views since the comet's closest approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Technosignature search conducted:</strong> December 18, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope used:</strong> Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope</li>
    <li><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 1–12 GHz</li>
    <li><strong>Findings:</strong> No credible detections of alien signals</li>
    <li><strong>Research team:</strong> Ben Jacobson Bell, Steve Croft, Ellie White, Andrew P. V. Siemion, Matthew Lebofsky, David H. E. MacMahon</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 18, 2025, researchers conducted a technosignature search of 3I/ATLAS using the Green Bank Telescope. The aim was to detect any potential signs of life as the comet approached Earth.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth. Following this, the research team published their findings, indicating that the comet displayed typical characteristics of a comet and did not show any unusual behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, made its closest approach to Earth on 2025 December 19. We report a nondetection of candidate signals down to the 100 mW level,” the researchers stated in their paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There is currently no evidence to suggest that ISOs are anything other than natural astrophysical objects,” the research team concluded.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya of NASA said, “All evidence points to it being a comet.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nicola Fox from the Science Mission Directorate added, “We certainly haven’t seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to enter the solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua. Its discovery in July 2025 sparked discussions about the potential for alien origins, particularly due to its unusual trajectory. However, the recent findings have reinforced the view that such objects are likely natural phenomena.</p>

<p>The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) has echoed the research team's conclusions, emphasizing that 3I/ATLAS behaves as expected from natural astrophysical processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the outer solar system for any new data. The scientific community remains watchful for any further developments regarding the comet's behavior.</p>
