      <h2>NASA's 3I/ATLAS-Inspired Theory Transforms Christmas Star Mystery</h2>

<p>NASA scientist Mark Matney has proposed a new theory regarding the Star of Bethlehem, suggesting it was not a star but a comet, during a presentation on December 3, 2025, in the Journal of the British Astronomical Association. The theory aims to explain the celestial mystery that has puzzled scientists and theologians for centuries.</p>

<p>This new understanding could reshape interpretations of the Nativity story and offers a scientific explanation for the phenomenon described in the Bible. Matney's research connects ancient historical records with modern astrophysics, suggesting that a comet may have influenced the Magi's journey to Bethlehem.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Research published on December 3, 2025, by Mark Matney, a NASA planetary scientist.</li>
    <li>Study released in the Journal of the British Astronomical Association.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025, moving at 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Comet's closest approach to Earth estimated between 236,000 and 249,000 miles.</li>
    <li>Historic records indicate a comet was visible for over 70 days in 5 BC.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is the third such object identified in our solar system. On December 3, 2025, Matney published his study proposing that the biblical Star of Bethlehem was a comet similar to 3I/ATLAS. His research draws on ancient Chinese records from 5 BC, which describe a comet that could have appeared to hover in the night sky.</p>

<p>Matney's findings suggest that the apparent motion of the comet could match the description in the Gospel of Matthew, where the star is said to have led the Magi. The comet's trajectory would have created the illusion of it standing still in the heavens.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is the first astronomical candidate for the Star ever identified that could have had apparent motion corresponding to the description in Matthew,” said Matney in his research abstract.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The identification of the Star of Bethlehem has been a subject of debate for centuries. Historical theories have included planetary alignments, supernovae, and other celestial events. Matney's theory presents a new perspective that combines historical records with modern astronomical data.</p>

<p>Previous theories, such as those proposed by Johannes Kepler in 1614 and more recent studies by Dr. Karlis Kaufmanis and Professor Colin Nicol, have not fully explained the biblical account of the star.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth this December, it will provide a unique opportunity for further research and observation. Scientists will continue to study its properties and trajectory to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their historical significance.</p>
