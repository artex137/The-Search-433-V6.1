      <h2>Everything we know about mystery ‘alien spaceship’ expert warned could 'change course for Earth' today</h2>

<p>An expert has warned that a mystery ‘alien spaceship’ could change course for Earth today, October 29. Comet 3I/ATLAS, first identified by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in July, is an interstellar object that has raised questions about its origins and characteristics.</p>

<p>This matter is significant because it has sparked debates among scientists and conspiracy theorists. Authorities, including NASA and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), are monitoring the comet due to its unusual behaviour and potential implications for space policy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date identified:</strong> July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles or 270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest point to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units (about 130 million miles or 210 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Claimed chance of being artificial:</strong> 30 to 40 percent, according to Avi Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Significant emissions:</strong> Carbon dioxide, water, water ice, and carbonyl sulphide detected by JWST and NIRSpec</li>
    <li><strong>IAWN designation:</strong> First interstellar object added to its list of threats</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, NASA’s ATLAS first identified Comet 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar object. Since then, it has displayed unusual behaviour, prompting expert Avi Loeb to speculate about its origins. On October 29, Loeb suggested that the comet may be a ‘potentially hostile’ alien craft, urging world leaders to take UFOs seriously.</p>

<p>As of October 29, 2023, the comet is approaching its closest point to the Sun, raising questions about its trajectory and potential implications for Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb said, "I believe that we need an international organisation that will make policy decisions about such an object."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nasa stated, "Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object recorded in our solar system’s history. Its unusual characteristics, including a high carbon dioxide to water ratio, have led to discussions about its origins. The IAWN's decision to add 3I/ATLAS to its list highlights the unique challenges posed by interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun in 2025. Ongoing analysis will focus on its emissions and trajectory to better understand its nature and any potential implications for Earth.</p>
