      <h2>Documentary claims three UFOs landed in New Mexico — and George Bush knew about the 'alien' encounter</h2>

<p>A new Amazon Prime documentary, titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, has claimed that three unidentified flying objects (UFOs) landed at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico in 1964, and that former US President George H.W. Bush was informed about the encounter in private discussions years later. The documentary features testimony from astrophysicist Eric Davis, who alleges that military personnel witnessed the event.</p>

<p>This revelation has sparked renewed debate over UFO disclosures and government transparency. The film suggests that a secret US government initiative, known as the "Legacy Programme," has been involved in retrieving crashed vehicles and alien bodies for decades. Public officials and former military personnel have raised concerns about the implications of secrecy surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary released on Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li>Claims UFOs landed at Holloman Air Force Base in 1964.</li>
    <li>Testimony from Eric Davis, former advisor for the Pentagon's AATIP.</li>
    <li>George H.W. Bush reportedly informed about incident in 2003.</li>
    <li>Documentary lacks physical evidence, relying on testimonies.</li>
    <li>Injuries reported by military personnel exposed to unidentified phenomena.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1964, three unidentified craft are alleged to have landed at Holloman Air Force Base in Otero County, New Mexico. Military personnel reportedly witnessed one craft landing on the tarmac. In 2003, Eric Davis claims he had private conversations with George H.W. Bush, where he was informed about the incident. The documentary, released recently, discusses the implications of a secretive government program related to UFO retrieval.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Whoever it is, they are here. And they have been operating here for a long time,” said Hal Puthoff, a physicist featured in the film.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The assumption that presidents are fully briefed on UFO matters is naive,” warned former Senator Marco Rubio.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This film puts us in a different place,” said director Dan Farah, expressing hope for increased transparency on UFO incidents.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary revisits prior claims about UFO encounters and government secrecy. Previous incidents, such as a supposed 1988 UFO crash in Russia, are also mentioned. The ongoing discussion about unidentified aerial phenomena has prompted calls for more openness from government agencies regarding their investigations and findings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the documentary gains attention, discussions among lawmakers and the public continue regarding the need for transparency about UFOs and potential national security risks. Investigations into the Legacy Programme and related claims may be pursued, but specific next steps have not been disclosed.</p>
