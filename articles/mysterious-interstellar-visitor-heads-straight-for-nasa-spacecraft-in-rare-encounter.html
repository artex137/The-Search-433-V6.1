      <h2>Mysterious interstellar visitor heads straight for NASA spacecraft in rare encounter</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is on a trajectory to pass near NASA's Europa Clipper and the European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft between October 25 and November 6, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant as it presents a rare opportunity to study the comet's ion tail, which extends millions of miles from its coma. Researchers aim to collect valuable data that could enhance our understanding of interstellar bodies. The Tailcatcher program has predicted a minimum distance of roughly five million miles during this encounter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Expected pass date: October 25 to November 6, 2025</li>
    <li>NASA spacecraft: Europa Clipper</li>
    <li>ESA spacecraft: Hera</li>
    <li>Minimum predicted distance: Approximately 5 million miles</li>
    <li>Research team: Includes co-author Samuel Gran from the Finnish Meteorological Institute</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between October 25 and November 6, 2025, 3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to the Europa Clipper and Hera spacecraft.</p>
<p>The Tailcatcher program predicts the spacecraft will be immersed within the ion tail of the comet, allowing for the collection of unprecedented data.</p>
<p>A special training exercise is set to run from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, focusing on refining methods to track 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Sampling the tail in this way is the closest we can currently get to a direct sample of such an object, and thus a different part of the galaxy,” said Samuel Gran, co-author of the study.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The object is causing unique challenges for predicting its trajectory,” officials with the International Asteroid Warning Network stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the first interstellar object added to the International Asteroid Warning Network's list. It has displayed unusual features, including an “anti-tail” that points toward the Sun. Previous interstellar objects have not presented such anomalies.</p>
<p>The ESA’s Hera spacecraft is currently traveling through the asteroid belt to the Didymos-Dimorphos binary asteroid system, which is under study for planetary defense.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the encounter, researchers will analyze data from both spacecraft to enhance understanding of interstellar comets. The upcoming training exercise will help improve detection methods for future close encounters with similar objects.</p>
