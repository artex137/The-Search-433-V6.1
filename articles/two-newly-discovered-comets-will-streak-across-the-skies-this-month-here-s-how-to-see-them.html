      <h2>Two Newly Discovered Comets Will Streak Across the Skies This Month</h2>

<p>Skywatchers can expect to see two newly discovered comets, C/2025 R2 (SWAN) and C/2025 A6 (Lemmon), soar across the night skies in October 2025. Comet SWAN will be closest to Earth on October 19, while Lemmon will follow with its closest approach on October 21. Both comets may become visible to the naked eye during their flybys.</p>

<p>This celestial event is significant for astronomers and enthusiasts alike, as both comets are set to brighten as they approach Earth. Authorities, including NASA, have been monitoring their trajectories closely, providing updates for optimal viewing times and locations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet SWAN closest approach: October 19, 2025</li>
  <li>Comet Lemmon closest approach: October 21, 2025</li>
  <li>SWAN's distance from Earth at closest approach: approximately 24 million miles (39 million kilometers)</li>
  <li>SWAN brightness magnitude: around 5.9</li>
  <li>Lemmon's speed: up to 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 kilometers per hour)</li>
  <li>SWAN best viewed in Southern Hemisphere; Lemmon in Northern Hemisphere</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon was first spotted in January 2025 at the Mt. Lemmon SkyCenter in Arizona. It is currently traveling toward the inner solar system. In September 2025, amateur astronomer Vladimir Bezugly discovered Comet SWAN using images from NASA's SOHO satellite. SWAN has become significantly brighter as it moves away from the Sun.</p>

<p>As of September 28, SWAN crossed into the Libra constellation and is expected to move through Scorpius by October 10. Lemmon will pass near Cor Caroli on October 16, making it potentially visible to the naked eye.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Both comets are exciting discoveries that offer a unique opportunity for skywatchers to observe these icy visitors as they approach the Sun,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are often unpredictable in brightness and visibility. Previous comets have provided spectacular views, drawing attention from amateur astronomers and the public. The study of comets contributes to our understanding of the early solar system and the formation of planetary bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comets approach Earth, NASA and other astronomical agencies will continue to provide updates on their visibility and trajectories. Skywatchers are encouraged to check local conditions for optimal viewing times.</p>
