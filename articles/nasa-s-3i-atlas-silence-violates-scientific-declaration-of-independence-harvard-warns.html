      <h2>NASA's 3I/ATLAS Silence 'Violates Scientific Declaration of Independence', Harvard Warns</h2>

<p>Harvard Professor Avi Loeb has warned that NASA's silence regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS violates what he describes as the scientific declaration of independence. The warning follows the object's discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope, marking it as only the third such object detected in the solar system.</p>

<p>This issue highlights the ongoing debate about the relationship between science and society, particularly regarding the accessibility and communication of scientific knowledge. Loeb argues that public interest should guide research priorities, especially when taxpayer funding is involved. He believes that the anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS warrant further investigation to maintain public trust and engagement in science.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Only the third interstellar object detected in the solar system.</li>
    <li>Projected close approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>Statistical likelihood of its distance matching Jupiter's Hill radius is less than 0.00004.</li>
    <li>Loeb expects controversy resolution by December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope discovered 3I/ATLAS, igniting discussions about its nature and origin. The object has displayed 13 anomalies that challenge its classification as a typical comet. On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS is expected to make a close approach to Jupiter. Loeb anticipates that data from this encounter will help clarify the object’s nature.</p>

<p>Loeb has stressed the importance of addressing public curiosity and aligning scientific research with taxpayer interests, particularly in the context of extraterrestrial intelligence. He has pointed out that the 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics prioritized the search for microbial life but did not recommend funding for technological signatures, despite public interest.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Excluding the anomalies from the vocabulary of NASA officials alienates the public, because it violates the scientific declaration of independence,” said Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has highlighted a perceived disconnect between academia and the public. Loeb has noted that communication in academia often remains unidirectional, with scientists failing to engage with public curiosity. This has raised questions about how scientific priorities align with taxpayer intentions.</p>

<p>Loeb argues that the current situation presents an opportunity to improve scientific communication and engagement, emphasizing the need for transparency and public inclusion in research processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will gather data to confirm or deny its nature by December 2025. Loeb is advocating for a shift towards a more inclusive scientific dialogue that respects public interest and fosters engagement.</p>
