      <h2>‘It does comet things’ NASA division head puts 3I/ATLAS alien spaceship concerns to rest</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor, has raised concerns about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, claiming it may be an alien spaceship. NASA has responded to these claims, stating that the object behaves like a comet. The object is expected to pass close to Mars next month.</p>

<p>This matter has drawn significant public attention and concern. NASA officials have reiterated that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that 3I/ATLAS is a natural celestial body rather than an artificial construct.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object approaching the solar system.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has described its presence as “dire” for humanity.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to come close to Mars in the upcoming month.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Thomas Statler has confirmed the object behaves like a comet.</li>
    <li>Loeb’s assertions have sparked widespread media attention.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb first made headlines with his claims about 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it might be an alien spaceship. Following his statements, NASA officials, including Thomas Statler, addressed the concerns. Statler provided reassurance that the object behaves like a comet, countering Loeb’s claims.</p>
<p>NASA has actively communicated with the public to clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS and to alleviate fears regarding its potential threat.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet,” Thomas Statler, head of NASA’s Solar System Small Bodies, stated. “It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Statler further explained, “The evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It’s a comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims about 3I/ATLAS have raised discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial life and the nature of interstellar objects. Previous instances of similar claims have often been met with skepticism from the scientific community.</p>
<p>NASA has consistently urged caution and critical thinking when assessing extraordinary claims regarding unidentified celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars and will provide updates to ensure the public is informed about the object's characteristics and trajectory.</p>
