      <h2>3I/ATLAS holds 'very abundant' chemical key to life as it heads for Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is producing chemical compounds linked to the origins of life as it travels through the solar system. NASA has stated that the comet poses no danger to Earth. Since its discovery in July, experts have observed unusual characteristics, prompting ongoing discussions in the scientific community.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may provide insights into the building blocks of life. NASA astrochemist Dr. Martin Cordiner and his team at the Goddard Space Flight Centre have reported unusually high levels of hydrogen cyanide and methanol being produced by the comet. The findings have led to further analysis of the object's properties and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery: July 2023</li>
    <li>NASA's assessment: No danger to Earth</li>
    <li>Hydrogen cyanide and methanol levels: Unusually high</li>
    <li>Research conducted by: Dr. Martin Cordiner and team</li>
    <li>Observation tool: Atacama Large Submillimeter Array (ALMA)</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb's claim: 30 to 40% chance comet is not naturally formed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. Since then, experts have studied its characteristics, including its chemical composition. Recently, Dr. Cordiner's team identified high levels of hydrogen cyanide and methanol using ALMA, which has sparked further interest in the comet's origins.</p>
<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has noted that images from the Hubble telescope show 3I/ATLAS trailing two jets, suggesting further investigation is needed. Loeb's assertion regarding the comet's potential artificial formation remains outside mainstream scientific consensus.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Things which needed explaining,” said Avi Loeb regarding the jets observed in Hubble telescope images of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We have identified unusually high levels of hydrogen cyanide and methanol,” stated Dr. Martin Cordiner about the comet's chemical output.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS and its chemical compounds adds to a growing body of research into celestial bodies that may hold clues about the origins of life. Previous studies have explored similar phenomena but have not identified such high levels of key life-sustaining chemicals.</p>
<p>Discussions around the possibility of non-natural formation of celestial bodies have been ongoing, though they remain contentious within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Further studies will likely focus on its chemical composition and potential implications for understanding the origins of life in the universe.</p>
