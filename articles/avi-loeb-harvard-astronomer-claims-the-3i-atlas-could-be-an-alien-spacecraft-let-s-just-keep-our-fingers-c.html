      <h2>Avi Loeb claims 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, has suggested that the comet 3I/ATLAS may be an alien spacecraft. He made these remarks during an interview with NewsNation, where he expressed his anticipation for upcoming data from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The high-resolution images are expected to provide further insight into the comet, which has intrigued the scientific community.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked interest as scientists largely believe the comet is composed of common elements found throughout the universe. Loeb, however, maintains that the final verdict on the comet's origin is yet to be determined and emphasizes the importance of waiting for more data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a Harvard professor and a theoretical physicist.</li>
    <li>The comet 3I/ATLAS is currently being studied by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>Loeb has previously organized a $1.5-million expedition to investigate the meteor CNEOS 2014-01-08.</li>
    <li>Loeb has made similar claims about the interstellar object Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>No significant findings have been reported from his past expeditions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has expressed his views on extraterrestrial life associated with various celestial objects over the years. In 2014, he led an expedition to find pieces of a meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere, claiming it could have been of alien origin.</p>
<p>In late 2017, the interstellar object Oumuamua passed through the solar system, prompting Loeb to suggest it might also be alien in nature. He published a book about his theories following this event.</p>
<p>Currently, he is focusing on 3I/ATLAS and awaits new data from NASA, which is expected to shed light on this comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The verdict is still out,” Loeb stated. “I’m very much looking forward to getting more data in the coming weeks.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also commented, “It’s like a detective story, and any of my colleagues who claim to know it’s a comet of a type that is familiar to us is not really curious or imaginative about nature.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Let’s just keep our fingers crossed,” he concluded.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has a history of controversial claims regarding extraterrestrial life. His expedition to find fragments of the meteor CNEOS 2014-01-08 ended without any significant discoveries. He has often utilized media platforms to promote his theories, leading to a mix of support and skepticism within the scientific community.</p>
<p>His previous assertions about Oumuamua also faced criticism, as many scientists believed it to be a natural phenomenon. Loeb’s approach has drawn attention both for its boldness and for the lack of empirical evidence supporting his claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb and the scientific community await the return of high-resolution images from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which may provide further information on the comet 3I/ATLAS. Further analysis and discussions are expected as new data becomes available in the coming weeks.</p>
