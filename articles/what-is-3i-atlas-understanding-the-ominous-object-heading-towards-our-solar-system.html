      <h2>What is 3I/Atlas? Understanding the ominous object heading towards our solar system</h2>

<p>3I/Atlas, an interstellar object larger than Mount Everest, is approaching our solar system at a speed of 209,000 kilometres per hour. The object is currently on a path that will bring it closer to Mars than Earth, according to reports from NASA and other astronomers.</p>

<p>This object has attracted significant attention from the scientific community due to its unusual characteristics. Unlike typical comets, 3I/Atlas lacks a tail, which has raised questions about its nature. It was first detected by a telescope in Chile and photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope when it was approximately 446 million kilometres away. Experts are monitoring its trajectory as it moves through space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 209,000 kph</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 446 million km (when last photographed)</li>
    <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Closer to Mars than Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Detection:</strong> First seen by a telescope in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Photographed by:</strong> Hubble Space Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first detected by a telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, it was photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope, revealing its trajectory and characteristics. The object is currently en route towards Mars, and its approach has raised interest among astronomers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This object is behaving differently from previous visitors to our galaxy," said Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University. "It has been classified on a scale from zero to ten, with 3I/Atlas rated as a four, indicating that it is not a natural body."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas follows two previous interstellar visitors, Oumuamua and Borisov, which were also closely monitored by scientists. The unusual characteristics of 3I/Atlas, including its speed and lack of a tail, have prompted discussions about the nature of such objects and the possibility of them being artificial in origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts are continuing to monitor 3I/Atlas as it travels through space. Professor Loeb has called for a global treaty to address potential scenarios should the object prove to be of alien origin.</p>
