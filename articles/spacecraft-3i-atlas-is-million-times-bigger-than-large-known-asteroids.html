      <h2>'Spacecraft' 3I/ATLAS is million times bigger than large known asteroids</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has published a blog asserting that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is significantly larger than previously known interstellar objects, suggesting it may be an alien spacecraft. Loeb's claims, made public on his blog, have sparked discussions among scientists regarding the implications of the comet's size and features.</p>

<p>Loeb argues that the inferred mass of 3I/ATLAS is over <strong>50 billion tonnes</strong>, which he states is at least a million times greater than that of 1I/Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object. He suggests that the comet's jets might be technological thrusters, indicating a possible artificial origin. This has led to concerns that 3I/ATLAS could trigger a globally significant "black swan event," a term used to describe unpredictable yet impactful occurrences. Authorities are now called to consider strategies in the event that the comet reveals an artificial origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Inferred mass:</strong> Over 50 billion tonnes</li>
    <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> At least a million times more massive than 1I/Oumuamua</li>
    <li><strong>Source of claims:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li><strong>Potential implications:</strong> Possible alien spacecraft; risk of a "black swan event"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has made his claims regarding 3I/ATLAS public through his blog. He details the comet's mass and features, comparing it to 1I/Oumuamua and arguing for its potential artificial origin. As discussions continue, scientists and global agencies are prompted to consider the implications and necessary responses to this interstellar object.</p>

<p>Loeb identifies ten unusual features of the comet that suggest it may not be a natural object. He emphasizes the need for global agencies to remain vigilant regarding the implications of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The inferred mass of over 50 billion tons is at least a million times more than the inferred mass of 1I/Oumuamua,” Loeb wrote in his blog.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If, however, we consider the possibility that the jets emanating from 3I/ATLAS are associated with technological thrusters, then the required mass loss can be 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller with human-made technologies,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects that have intrigued scientists. Previous objects, like 1I/Oumuamua, have led to discussions about the nature of such phenomena and the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. Loeb's claims, however, take this conversation further by suggesting that the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS could indicate an artificial origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions continue, global agencies are urged to prepare for potential scenarios regarding the comet's origins. Scientists will monitor 3I/ATLAS closely to determine its characteristics and implications for planetary defense.</p>
