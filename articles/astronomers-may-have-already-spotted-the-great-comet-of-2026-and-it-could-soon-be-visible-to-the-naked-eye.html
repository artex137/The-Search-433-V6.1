      <h2>Astronomers may have already spotted the 'Great Comet of 2026'</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered Comet C/2025 R3 (PanSTARRS), which may soon be visible to the naked eye and is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on April 27, 2026. The comet was first identified on September 8, 2025, by the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) in Hawaii.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as C/2025 R3 could become the brightest comet of the year. Scientists are monitoring its trajectory and brightness, which remains uncertain as the comet approaches the sun. Observers anticipate that viewing conditions will be optimal around its perihelion on April 20, 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R3 discovered on September 8, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun on April 20, 2026, at 47.4 million miles (76.3 million km).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on April 27, 2026, at 44 million miles (70.8 million km).</li>
    <li>Currently located about 216 million miles (348 million km) from Earth.</li>
    <li>Projected brightness ranges from apparent magnitude 2.5 to 8.</li>
    <li>Best viewing opportunity expected around April 17, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 8, 2025, astronomers at Pan-STARRS in Hawaii discovered Comet C/2025 R3. The comet is currently traveling towards the sun and will reach perihelion on April 20, 2026. Following this, it will make its closest approach to Earth on April 27, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The best chance to see C/2025 R3 will likely be just before perihelion, when a new moon will darken the night sky, making it easier to spot objects on the cusp of naked-eye visibility,” according to Space.com.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous comets that have passed Earth include 12P/Pons-Brooks and Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS in 2024. In 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS gained attention, although it has since moved away from Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to track C/2025 R3's brightness and trajectory as it approaches the sun, aiming to provide updates on its visibility in the coming months.</p>
