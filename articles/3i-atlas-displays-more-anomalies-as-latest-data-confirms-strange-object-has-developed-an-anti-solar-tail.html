      <h2>3I/ATLAS Displays More Anomalies as Latest Data Confirms Strange Object Has “Developed an Anti-Solar Tail”</h2>

<p>New observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have revealed significant anomalies, including the confirmation of an “anti-tail,” as researchers continue to study its unusual composition. The latest findings emerged from data collected on August 24, 2025, using the Keck II telescope in Hawaii.</p>

<p>The investigation, led by researchers at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, aims to understand the unique chemical signatures of 3I/ATLAS, which is rich in nickel and lacks iron. These characteristics suggest that the comet may exhibit exotic chemical processes not previously documented in other comets, potentially offering insights into the composition of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Data collected: August 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Keck II telescope, Hawaii</li>
    <li>Nickel emission plume extends approximately 600 kilometers</li>
    <li>Cyanide plume extends approximately 840 kilometers</li>
    <li>Total mass loss rate: close to 150 kilograms per second</li>
    <li>Water ejection rate: up to 40 kilograms per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/ATLAS have progressed significantly since it was first identified. The latest data from the Keck II telescope indicate that the comet has developed an anti-solar tail, a structure pointing towards the Sun, which is unusual for comets. Earlier this year, the James Webb Space Telescope provided insights into the object's composition, revealing a high concentration of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and minimal water.</p>
<p>In August 2025, researchers captured emissions of nickel and cyanide, confirming the comet's unique chemical profile. The findings have raised questions regarding the processes that may occur near the comet's nucleus.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Other than 3I/ATLAS, this anomaly was only known to exist in industrially-produced nickel alloys,” wrote theoretical physicist Avi Loeb, summarizing the findings in a post on Medium.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The peculiarities of 3I/ATLAS stand in stark contrast to previous cometary observations, such as comet Borisov, which contained iron. The current study suggests that the unique nickel abundance could be the result of processes similar to those used in industrial nickel refinement, a hypothesis that could reshape understanding of cometary chemistry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are anticipated, with imagery from the HiRISE camera aboard NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter expected to provide clearer views of the comet. However, the release of this imagery is currently delayed due to the U.S. government shutdown. Additional spacecraft, including ESA’s Juice mission in November 2025 and NASA’s Juno spacecraft in March, are also set to observe the comet in the coming months.</p>
