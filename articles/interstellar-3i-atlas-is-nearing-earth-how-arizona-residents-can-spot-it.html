      <h2>Interstellar 3I/ATLAS is nearing Earth. How Arizona residents can spot it</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is projected to pass within about 170 million miles of Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet poses no danger to our planet, according to NASA officials. Scientists have been studying the object, which originated outside our solar system, using telescopes like Hubble and James Webb.</p>

<p>This approach marks a significant opportunity for scientists to examine an ancient comet that has traveled from another part of the Milky Way. As the comet approaches, many residents in Arizona and beyond are eager to learn how to spot it in the night sky.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> 3I/ATLAS closest approach to Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> About 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Not visible to the naked eye; observable with a small telescope</li>
    <li><strong>Location in sky:</strong> Under the star Regulus in the constellation Leo</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 while traveling through our solar system. Observations confirmed that it originated from outside the solar system and is on a hyperbolic trajectory that will eventually take it back into interstellar space.</p>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has passed within the orbit of Mars and has come within 130 million miles of the Sun. It is expected to be closest to Earth on December 19, offering scientists a unique chance to study its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” stated NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy in a social media exchange.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” said Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third object confirmed to have originated from outside Earth's solar system. The comet's unusual trajectory and composition have sparked various theories, including speculation about extraterrestrial technology. NASA officials have consistently dismissed these claims, emphasizing the natural origins of the comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, scientists will continue to observe and collect data from the comet. Public interest in viewing the comet is expected to grow, with resources available for skywatchers to track its path through the night sky.</p>
