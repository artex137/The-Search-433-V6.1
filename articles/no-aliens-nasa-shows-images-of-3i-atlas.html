      <h2>No Aliens: NASA Shows Images of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released new images of the celestial body 3I/ATLAS during a press conference following the end of a budget freeze. The agency has confirmed that the comet is not an alien spacecraft, as some speculated, but rather a comet entering our solar system from interstellar space. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This announcement is significant as it marks the culmination of an observation campaign involving twelve probes that have captured images of 3I/ATLAS. NASA aims to enhance scientific understanding of this unique comet and its characteristics compared to other comets in our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet will come closest to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of over 273 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Twelve probes have captured images of the comet.</li>
    <li>Images include observations from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN).</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's Trace Gas Orbiter also observed the comet.</li>
    <li>China's National Space Administration has released images of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023. Following its discovery, NASA's operations were largely halted due to a budget freeze, delaying the release of information and images of the comet. As the budget freeze ended, NASA held a press conference to present images from various space probes, showcasing the comet's journey through the solar system.</p>

<p>The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of over 273 million kilometers, which is nearly twice the distance from Earth to the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "By observing the comet from so many locations, NASA has the opportunity to learn more about how 3I/ATLAS differs from the comets in our solar system and to provide scientists with new insights into how other systems differ from our own," NASA announced.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "This object is a comet," emphasized Deputy NASA Director Amit Kshatrya. "It looks like a comet, behaves like a comet, all indications point to it being a comet."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known celestial body to have entered our solar system from interstellar space, which is significant for astrophysical research. The comet's initial images did not show a tail, leading to speculation about its nature. However, NASA has clarified that the delays in releasing information were due to operational limitations during the budget freeze.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, providing further insights and images from ongoing observations leading up to its closest encounter in December.</p>
