      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2023, at approximately 170 million miles from the planet, NASA has announced. This distance is roughly twice that between Earth and the sun. 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever recorded, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers and space enthusiasts, as it provides a rare opportunity to study the comet's composition and origins. Authorities have coordinated efforts to observe the comet, which is expected to be visible in the predawn sky through binoculars or telescopes. NASA has also provided online viewing options through a livestream hosted by the Virtual Telescope Project.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Speed: Estimated at 130,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2023, by a NASA-funded telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Visibility: Predawn sky, beneath Regulus in the constellation Leo</li>
    <li>Livestream: Starts at 11 p.m. EST on December 18, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2023, by a telescope in Chile as part of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Following its discovery, the comet has passed Mars and approached the sun, where it has been observed by various NASA spacecraft and ground-based telescopes.</p>
<p>As the comet nears Earth, researchers have been closely monitoring its progress, aiming to gather data on the gases and dust released from its nucleus as it warms up from solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This could be your best bet to see this interstellar interloper,” said Chelsea Gohd, a science writer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second,” said David Jewitt, an astronomer at the University of California, Los Angeles.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We want the community to use the latest and greatest techniques,” said James Bauer, an astronomer at the University of Maryland and investigator at the International Asteroid Warning Network.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its interstellar origin but also for the insights it may offer into comet formation. Observations suggest it contains a high amount of carbon dioxide relative to water vapor, potentially indicating that comets can form in much farther regions from their host stars than previously understood.</p>
<p>The comet's journey through the solar system has provided an opportunity for a global network of observatories and citizen scientists to test new techniques for tracking celestial objects, which could aid future missions to similar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach, 3I/ATLAS is expected to remain visible to astronomers with telescopes until spring 2024, when it will pass by Jupiter. Following this, the comet will exit the solar system and will not return.</p>
