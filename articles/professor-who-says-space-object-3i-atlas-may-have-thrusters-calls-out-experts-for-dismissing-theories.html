      <h2>Professor who says space object 3I/ATLAS may have 'thrusters' calls out experts for dismissing theories</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the dismissal of unusual characteristics of the comet 3I/ATLAS, first observed in July 2023 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The comet, which is the third known interstellar visitor, is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<p>The debate over 3I/ATLAS is significant as it challenges prevailing assumptions about comet behavior. While NASA officials classify it as a natural comet, Loeb argues that its anomalies warrant further investigation. He has publicly questioned the scientific community's reluctance to explore alternative explanations for the comet's unusual features.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object after 1I/Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
    <li>Loeb has identified at least 13 anomalies related to 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The comet will be closest to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Loeb's theories have faced criticism from other scientists.</li>
    <li>No danger to Earth or other planets has been reported regarding its trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023, generating excitement among astronomers. Following its discovery, the comet exhibited behaviors that deviated from typical comet characteristics. On December 14 and 15, 2025, images revealed a prominent anti-tail extending up to 500,000 kilometers from the comet's nucleus.</p>
<p>In response to these findings, Professor Loeb has called for further inquiry into the comet's properties, suggesting that the unusual speed of the anti-tail material could indicate the presence of a technological thruster. As the comet approaches Earth, astronomers are preparing to observe its coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Why are comet experts and NASA officials so reluctant in displaying curiosity about the anti-tail or other anomalies of 3I/ATLAS?” - Professor Avi Loeb</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Any suggestion that it’s artificial is nonsense on stilts, and is an insult to the exciting work going on to understand this object.” - Chris Lintott, Oxford astronomer</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Dr Loeb’s essays in 3I/ATLAS are musings rather than scientific research.” - Adam Frank, astrophysicist</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing interest in interstellar objects. The previous interstellar visitors, 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have prompted discussions about the nature of such objects and the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretation of 3I/ATLAS's behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will observe its characteristics closely. Further studies may address the anomalies identified by Loeb, although no immediate changes to the current classification of the comet are anticipated. The scientific community will likely continue to debate its origins and behavior in the coming months.</p>
