      <h2>Navy officer claims crew saw ‘football field-sized’ UFO underwater</h2>

<p>A senior U.S. Navy officer has claimed his crew witnessed a massive unidentified underwater object racing through the ocean at around 322 kilometres per hour. The testimony adds to a growing number of reports of unidentified submerged objects, or USOs, being investigated by the Pentagon and Congress. Congressman Tim Burchett revealed the account during a congressional probe into unexplained aerial and underwater phenomena.</p>

<p>This matter has drawn attention as authorities investigate unexplained technology operating both in the sky and under the sea. Burchett stated that the object was as large as a football field and moved at speeds unattainable by current man-made technology. He emphasized that such encounters occurred in very deep water areas, complicating the explanation of the phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Witnessed object reportedly moved at approximately 200 mph (322 km/h).</li>
    <li>Congressman Tim Burchett disclosed the account during a congressional probe.</li>
    <li>Burchett stated the object was as large as a football field.</li>
    <li>Claims suggest the object moved nearly six times faster than advanced military submarines.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon is currently examining over 800 unexplained encounters, including USOs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to Burchett, the encounters occurred in “very deep water areas.” The testimonies have emerged amid a broader investigation into unidentified aerial and underwater phenomena by the Pentagon. Burchett has been vocal about the implications of these findings during congressional sessions.</p>

<p>Bob McGwire, a former intelligence officer, also reported a similar encounter while serving aboard the USS Hampton. He described hearing “something whizzing by” the submarine at speeds faster than sound, which he claimed was not part of any U.S. experiment or secret project.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “A very high-ranking member of the Navy described some underwater experiences with something that was doing 200 mph underwater,” Burchett said. “It was as big as a football field. That’s no fish.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The sub’s sonar picked it up. It blew by us,” McGwire said, recalling the incident. “It is mine to tell whoever I want. They blew it,” he added, referring to the Navy’s failure to document the event properly.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around USOs has gained traction following various incidents, including a 2019 video showing the USS Omaha tracking a glowing orb off the coast of San Diego. This event, where the object hovered briefly before plunging into the water, has contributed to the ongoing investigation by the Pentagon into over 800 unexplained encounters.</p>

<p>Both Burchett and McGwire argue that these sightings suggest humans may not be alone or that unknown technology operates in Earth’s most remote environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the reports of USOs and UFOs are ongoing, with the Pentagon committed to examining the claims and gathering further evidence. No specific deadlines for the completion of these investigations have been disclosed.</p>
