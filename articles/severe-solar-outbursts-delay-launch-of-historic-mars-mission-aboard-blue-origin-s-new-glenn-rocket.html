      <h2>Severe solar outbursts delay launch of historic Mars mission aboard Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket</h2>

<p>NASA has postponed the launch of its twin ESCAPADE spacecraft to Mars, originally scheduled for November 12, due to severe solar activity. The launch aboard Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket will occur at an indeterminate date, according to Blue Origin officials.</p>

<p>This delay is significant as the ESCAPADE mission aims to study space weather, which has impacted its launch schedule. The active sun has generated adverse conditions that have prompted authorities to monitor space weather closely before proceeding with the mission.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Launch date originally set for November 12, 2023.</li>
    <li>Spacecraft: Twin ESCAPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers).</li>
    <li>Rocket: Blue Origin's New Glenn, 98 meters tall.</li>
    <li>Previous launch attempt on November 9 was cancelled due to weather.</li>
    <li>Mission cost: Nearly $80 million.</li>
    <li>Mission aims to study space weather effects on Mars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The ESCAPADE mission was scheduled for launch on November 12, 2023. However, strong solar activity led to a decision to postpone the launch. A launch attempt on November 9 was also stood down due to adverse weather conditions on Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Due to highly elevated solar activity and its potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft, NASA is postponing launch until space weather conditions improve,” Blue Origin officials stated. “We are currently assessing opportunities to establish our next launch window based on forecasted space weather and range availability.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ESCAPADE mission is designed to investigate how solar activity has influenced Mars' atmosphere, which has thinned over time, affecting the planet's ability to retain water. This mission is part of a broader effort to understand the solar cycle, which peaks in 2025, and its implications for space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and Blue Origin will continue to monitor space weather conditions to determine a new launch window for the ESCAPADE mission. Further updates will be provided as the situation evolves.
