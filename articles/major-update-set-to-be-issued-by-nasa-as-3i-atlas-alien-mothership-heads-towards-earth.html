      <h2>Major update set to be issued by NASA as 3I/Atlas 'alien mothership' heads towards Earth</h2>

<p>NASA will unveil new images of comet 3I/Atlas today at 8 p.m. GMT, following months of speculation about the object's identity. The space agency plans to hold a press conference to present photos captured by various spacecraft and telescopes, which have not been publicly shown due to the recent US government shutdown.</p>

<p>This announcement is significant as it may clarify the nature of 3I/Atlas, which some scientists believe to be a comet, while others, including theoretical physicist Avi Loeb, have suggested it could be an alien "mothership." The comet has been travelling through the Solar System at speeds of 130,000 mph, raising concerns about its trajectory. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has also expressed interest in monitoring the object closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA's press conference is scheduled for 8 p.m. GMT today.</li>
    <li>The event will feature images captured by various spacecraft and telescopes.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is travelling at approximately 209,215 km/h (130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>The comet will make its nearest approach to Earth at a distance of 273 million kilometers (170 million miles) next month.</li>
    <li>NASA personnel were furloughed during the government shutdown from October 1 to November 12.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early June, 3I/Atlas was confirmed as an interstellar object. Since then, researchers have utilized advanced telescopes worldwide to gather information on the comet. The object has recently returned to view as it orbits around the sun.</p>
<p>NASA's shutdown, lasting from October 1 to November 12, restricted public communications and delayed the release of crucial images. The agency is set to resume its public outreach with the upcoming press conference.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>A spokesman for NASA stated, "Assets within NASA's science missions give the United States the unique capability to observe 3I/ATLAS almost the entire time it passes through our celestial neighborhood."</blockquote>
<blockquote>He added, "These assets include both spacecraft across the solar system, as well as ground-based observatories."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ongoing interest in 3I/Atlas is part of a larger trend in space exploration and public engagement with potential extraterrestrial phenomena. The recent US government shutdown has raised concerns about the impact on scientific research and communication.</p>
<p>NASA's ability to monitor 3I/Atlas highlights the advancements in observational technology, enabling scientists to study interstellar objects in unprecedented detail.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following today's press conference, NASA will continue monitoring 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth and later swings close to Jupiter early next year. The agency will also address public questions submitted via social media during the event.</p>
