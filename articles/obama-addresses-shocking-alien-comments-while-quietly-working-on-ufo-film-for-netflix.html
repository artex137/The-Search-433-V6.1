      <h2>Obama addresses alien comments amid UFO film project</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has clarified his recent remarks about extraterrestrial life, stating he has never seen evidence to support their existence. Obama made the comments during an Instagram post on February 15, 2026, following an interview with Brian Tyler Cohen.</p>

<p>This clarification comes as Obama’s production company, Higher Ground Productions, is reportedly developing a film inspired by one of the first UFO abduction stories in the United States. This project has raised eyebrows given the ongoing public interest in UFOs and alien life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Obama posted clarifications on Instagram on February 15, 2026.</li>
    <li>The film project is titled <em>White Mountains</em>, focusing on Betty and Barney Hill's alleged abduction in 1961.</li>
    <li>The Hills reported their experience on September 19, 1961, while driving in New Hampshire.</li>
    <li>Higher Ground Productions announced the film project in 2022.</li>
    <li>Obama claimed he saw no evidence of extraterrestrial contact during his presidency.</li>
    <li>The Netflix release date for <em>White Mountains</em> has not been disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 19, 1961, Betty and Barney Hill reported an encounter with a UFO while driving home from a vacation in Canada. The couple described a cigar-shaped craft and non-human figures inside. They later underwent hypnosis to recover memories of the incident.</p>

<p>On February 14, 2026, Obama appeared on a podcast and jokingly referred to his curiosity about aliens upon entering the presidency. Following this, he posted clarifications on Instagram about his belief in the possibility of alien life, emphasizing a lack of evidence during his presidency.</p>

<p>In 2022, news of the film <em>White Mountains</em> first emerged, with Higher Ground Productions working on a script based on the Hills' story.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” Obama wrote. “I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Hills' abduction claim is one of the most famous UFO stories in American history, despite skepticism surrounding their account. The couple maintained their story throughout their lives, passing lie detector tests. Barney Hill died in 1969, and Betty Hill passed away in 2004.</p>

<p>Obama's comments have reignited discussions about Area 51, a military base implicated in numerous alien conspiracy theories. The CIA acknowledged its existence in 2013, revealing it had been used for aircraft testing during the Cold War.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Higher Ground Productions continues to develop the film <em>White Mountains</em>, with no public announcements regarding production timelines or a release date. Investigations into UFO sightings remain ongoing, with Congress seeking definitive proof of extraterrestrial life.</p>
