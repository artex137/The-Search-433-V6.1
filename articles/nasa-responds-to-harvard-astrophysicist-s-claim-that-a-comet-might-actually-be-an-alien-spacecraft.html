      <h2>NASA Responds to Harvard Astrophysicist's Claim About Comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist and head of the Galileo Project, has claimed that Comet 3I/Atlas might actually be an alien spacecraft. Loeb made this assertion in a research paper published in July, and he elaborated on his hypothesis in a subsequent article.</p>

<p>This claim has prompted a response from NASA, which has been studying Comet 3I/Atlas. NASA officials have stated that their findings do not support Loeb's theories. The agency emphasizes that the comet exhibits characteristics typical of natural celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is the former chairman of Harvard's Department of Astronomy.</li>
    <li>NASA has classified 3I/Atlas as a natural comet.</li>
    <li>Tom Statler is the NASA lead scientist for solar system small bodies.</li>
    <li>Loeb's claims include potential dire consequences for humanity.</li>
    <li>NASA has identified only three interstellar objects, including 3I/Atlas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb published a research paper in July 2023, suggesting that Comet 3I/Atlas could be an alien spacecraft. He followed this with an article discussing the comet's trajectory and its speed, which he claims is greater than that of human-made rockets.</p>
<p>In response, NASA has conducted its own studies of the comet. Tom Statler stated that the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that 3I/Atlas is a natural object behaving like a comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA lead scientist for solar system small bodies.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity, and would possibly require defensive measures to be undertaken, though these might prove futile,” Avi Loeb stated in his article.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb has previously made controversial claims about extraterrestrial life and objects in our solar system. His past hypotheses include the idea that the asteroid Oumuamua, which appeared in 2017, could be an alien spacecraft. NASA has stated that interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas are not new, though they have only recently been able to identify them.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas and gather data to better understand its properties and behavior. Further studies may provide more insights into its composition and trajectory, but no immediate investigations or changes in policy have been announced.</p>
