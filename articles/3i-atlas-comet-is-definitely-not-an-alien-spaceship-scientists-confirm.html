      <h2>3I/ATLAS comet is definitely not an alien spaceship, scientists confirm</h2>

<p>Scientists and NASA officials have confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is a natural object and not alien technology. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, coming within approximately 170 million miles of the planet.</p>

<p>This clarification is significant as it addresses public concerns about the possibility of an alien invasion. NASA and a team of astronomers have conducted observations that provide evidence against the notion that 3I/ATLAS is a spacecraft. The findings aim to dispel conspiracy theories surrounding the comet's origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>Speed at discovery: 137,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Estimated size: between 1,400 feet and 3½ miles in diameter.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia.</li>
    <li>No radio signals detected indicating artificial technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025 as the third known object originating from outside Earth's solar system. It traveled from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and has been on a hyperbolic orbit, which will eventually take it back into interstellar space.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, astronomers observed the comet at its closest approach to Earth. Despite initial concerns about its nature, the observations revealed no signs of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said Sean Duffy, NASA's then-Acting Administrator, in a social media exchange.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” stated Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The speculation surrounding 3I/ATLAS as an alien spacecraft was fueled by various conspiracy theories, including claims from Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. While Loeb has acknowledged that the object is “most likely a comet of natural origin,” he has not completely dismissed the idea of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<p>The ongoing discourse highlights public interest in the search for intelligent life beyond Earth, particularly as astronomers continue to explore the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the scientific community will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the solar system. Observations and studies will further investigate the comet’s characteristics and support ongoing research into interstellar objects.</p>
