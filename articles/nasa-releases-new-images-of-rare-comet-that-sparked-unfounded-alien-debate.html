      <h2>NASA releases new images of rare comet that sparked unfounded ‘alien’ debate</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images and data of Comet 3I/ATLAS, the rare interstellar object that has generated speculation about its nature, during a live briefing at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center outside Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>The release of the new imagery comes after weeks of debate over whether the comet could be an alien spacecraft. NASA officials have clarified that 3I/ATLAS is a natural object, emphasizing its interstellar origin. “This object is a comet,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya. “But, it came from outside the solar system, which makes it fascinating.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's SPHEREx mission observed the comet from August 7 to August 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth will be about 170 million miles in November 2025.</li>
    <li>Passed within 19 million miles of Mars in early October 2025.</li>
    <li>Images released capture observations from September 20 to October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object detected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Initial discussions regarding its nature began shortly after its discovery, with some scientists suggesting it might be alien technology due to its unusual trajectory.</p>

<p>Between August 7 and August 15, NASA's SPHEREx mission conducted observations of the comet. During early October, it passed within 19 million miles of Mars, allowing NASA’s Mars missions to capture unique views.</p>

<p>NASA released new images and data about the comet during a live briefing on Wednesday, addressing the controversy surrounding its classification.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is not a danger to us,” said Nicky Fox, head of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It expanded people’s brains about how magical the universe could be,” said Amit Kshatriya, emphasizing the public's eagerness to engage with scientific discoveries.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate over 3I/ATLAS intensified after Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, suggested it could be an alien technology based on its characteristics. Loeb has been vocal about his concerns regarding government transparency on UFO-related issues.</p>

<p>NASA has reinforced that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, despite the ongoing speculation. The agency has stated that the comet poses no risk to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and will release further data from ongoing observations. The comet is expected to leave the solar system permanently after its current pass.</p>
