      <h2>NASA Publishes Images of the Third Interstellar Comet in History</h2>

<p>The American space agency NASA has released the first detailed images of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which is the third confirmed object to enter the Solar System from another stellar system. The comet, discovered in the summer of 2024, passed within 29 million kilometers of Mars in October, allowing scientists to study it using several orbiting spacecraft.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to observe an object from outside our Solar System. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have coordinated efforts to gather data on the comet, which is expected to continue for several weeks as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is estimated to measure between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers across.</li>
    <li>The comet passed 29 million kilometers from Mars in October 2024.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is visible to amateur astronomers in the eastern sky during pre-dawn hours.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur in mid-December 2024.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at a speed of approximately 60 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA missions are actively observing the comet with multiple spacecraft and ground-based observatories.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in the summer of 2024. It passed 29 million kilometers from Mars in October 2024. Observations began shortly thereafter, utilizing the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and two Mars orbiters operated by ESA.</p>

<p>As of now, amateur astronomers can see the comet in the pre-dawn hours. The closest approach to Earth is expected in mid-December 2024, after which the comet will exit the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is definitely a comet, not an alien ship,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s deputy administrator. “We actively search for signs of extraterrestrial life, but this object does not fall into that category.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar comet confirmed to have entered the Solar System. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicates it formed in a much older stellar environment, distinct from our Solar System.</p>

<p>The ongoing observations by NASA and ESA mark a significant collaboration in the study of interstellar objects, enhancing our understanding of the universe beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas in the coming weeks. Data from the ESA spacecraft Juice, which is currently en route to Jupiter, is expected to reach Earth in February 2025.</p>
