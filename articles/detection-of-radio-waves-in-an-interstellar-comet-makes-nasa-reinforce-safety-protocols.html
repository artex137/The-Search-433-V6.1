      <h2>Detection of radio waves in an interstellar comet makes NASA reinforce safety protocols</h2>

<p>NASA has detected radio waves from the interstellar comet 3I ATLAS, prompting the agency to enhance its safety protocols. The discovery was made on February 22, 2026, during observations conducted by astronomers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. No injuries or fatalities have been reported as a result of this event.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it marks the first instance of radio waves being identified from an interstellar comet. In response, NASA has initiated a review of its safety measures to ensure proper handling of potential risks associated with further studies of 3I ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of detection: February 22, 2026</li>
    <li>Location of observations: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California</li>
    <li>Comet name: 3I ATLAS</li>
    <li>Agency involved: NASA</li>
    <li>Reported injuries/fatalities: None</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 22, 2026, astronomers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory detected radio waves emanating from the interstellar comet 3I ATLAS. This marked a historic moment as it was the first time such waves have been recorded from an interstellar object.</p>

<p>Following the detection, NASA officials announced the immediate reinforcement of safety protocols. The agency aims to mitigate any potential risks associated with further exploration of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of radio waves from 3I ATLAS is a groundbreaking achievement for our understanding of interstellar objects,” said a NASA spokesperson. “We are taking this opportunity to review and strengthen our safety protocols.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This detection follows previous studies of interstellar comets, which have increasingly drawn interest from the scientific community. Safety protocols are critical in managing potential hazards linked to space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I ATLAS and conduct further analyses. The agency is expected to release updates on the findings and any modifications to safety measures in the near future.</p>
