      <h2>What did President of Russia Vladimir Putin say about 3I/ATLAS? Details explored</h2>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during his annual televised conference on December 19, 2025. He addressed questions from a journalist regarding reports from intelligence services about the comet and the possibility of extraterrestrial contact. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This discussion is significant as it highlights Russia's interest in space phenomena and its scientific community's monitoring of celestial bodies. Putin's comments come as 3I/ATLAS has recently made its closest approach to Earth, sparking public curiosity and speculation about potential extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Annual televised conference</li>
    <li>Date: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovery of 3I/ATLAS: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: Hundreds of millions of kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. On December 19, 2025, it made its closest approach to Earth. During this time, President Putin participated in his annual televised conference where he addressed questions about the comet and its implications.</p>

<p>Putin responded to a journalist's inquiry about the comet's potential as a sign of extraterrestrial life, jokingly referring to it as Russia's "secret weapon." He later clarified that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and provided a scientific explanation regarding its characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’ll tell you, but it must remain exclusively between us,” Putin said, referring to the comet as “classified information.” He added, “It’s our secret weapon, but we will only use it in the most extreme case because we are against deploying weapons in space.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>He further explained, “It has a different shell and as it approaches closer to the Sun, slightly different processes occur on its surface, including in the field tail of this rocket. Things look different there, but it’s quite large.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion of 3I/ATLAS comes amid growing global interest in celestial phenomena and the search for extraterrestrial life. Prior to this event, various theories and speculations had arisen regarding the comet's origins and behavior, contributing to public intrigue and scientific investigation.</p>

<p>Russia has maintained a focus on space exploration and monitoring, emphasizing the importance of scientific assessment in the face of sensational claims about extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, it is expected to pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026. Researchers plan to study the effects of Jupiter’s gravity on the comet. Further updates will be provided as the comet progresses through the solar system.</p>
