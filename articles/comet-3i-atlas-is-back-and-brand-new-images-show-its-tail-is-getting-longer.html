      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS is back, and brand new images show its tail is getting longer</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has re-emerged into the morning sky as of mid-November 2025, following a period of invisibility behind the Sun since October 2025. Astronomers have reported that new images show the comet’s tail is lengthening as it becomes visible again.</p>

<p>This re-emergence is significant for astronomers, as it provides an opportunity to study the comet's current condition. Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project has been capturing images of the comet and plans to host a live stream on 17 November 2025, allowing the public to observe this celestial event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Re-emergence Date:</strong> Mid-November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Period of Invisibility:</strong> October to early November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Live Stream Date:</strong> 17 November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Image Captured:</strong> 6, 10, and 11 November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Ion Tail Length:</strong> At least 0.7 degrees</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 6 November 2025, Gianluca Masi captured the first image of 3I/ATLAS after its re-emergence, despite challenges from lunar glare. The comet was positioned just 10 degrees above the eastern horizon.</p>

<p>By 10 November 2025, Masi observed improved conditions, with the comet 12 degrees above the horizon. He noted the visibility of the ion tail due to the evolving geometry.</p>

<p>On 11 November 2025, Masi took advantage of clearer skies to capture another image, revealing that the ion tail was lengthening as the comet continued to approach the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “An extremely bright (almost full) Moon was setting, with the target just 10 degrees above the eastern horizon,” said Gianluca Masi regarding the imaging conditions on 6 November.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Despite that, we clearly detected the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS, thanks to the evolving geometry,” Masi noted about the observations made on 10 November.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We could see the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS spanning at least 0.7 degrees, in the northeast direction,” Masi explained on 11 November, discussing the effects of solar heat on the comet’s ices.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been a subject of interest in 2025, particularly because of its interstellar origins. Its visibility has allowed astronomers to study its characteristics and behavior as it interacts with solar radiation.</p>

<p>The ability to observe the comet using Mars orbiters during its period behind the Sun demonstrates advancements in space observation technology and collaboration between different astronomical agencies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the upcoming live stream on 17 November 2025, astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves further into the morning sky, providing additional opportunities for observation and study.</p>
