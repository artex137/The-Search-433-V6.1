      <h2>3I/ATLAS Hype Overshadowed by Universe's Largest Rotating Structure</h2>

<p>Astronomers have reported that the excitement surrounding interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been overshadowed by the discovery of a colossal, rotating chain of galaxies, which may be the largest spinning object ever detected in the universe. This structure lies approximately 140 million light-years from Earth and challenges existing theories about galaxy formation and matter flow in the cosmos.</p>

<p>The discovery of this enormous rotating system is significant for understanding the universe's structure. Researchers suggest that it may provide more insight into cosmic formation than the recent flyby of comet 3I/ATLAS. The findings have been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The newly mapped structure is about <strong>140 million light-years</strong> from Earth.</li>
    <li>The filament is <strong>5.5 million light-years</strong> long and <strong>117,000 light-years</strong> wide.</li>
    <li>The structure contains <strong>14 galaxies</strong> aligned along a thread of cold hydrogen gas.</li>
    <li>The filament rotates at approximately <strong>68 miles per second</strong> (around <strong>110 kilometres per second</strong>).</li>
    <li>The discovery was made using the MeerKAT radio telescope array in South Africa.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The structure was detected as part of a broader survey conducted by astronomers using the MeerKAT telescope array. Researchers observed a striking alignment of galaxies shining at the same distance, leading to the realization that they were witnessing a coherent system rather than a random grouping. Follow-up measurements confirmed the filament's rotation and the alignment of surrounding galaxies.</p>

<blockquote>The initial discovery itself was a surprise. We observed a striking alignment of galaxies shining at the same distance,</blockquote> 
<cite>Lyla Jung, co-author</cite>.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery contributes to the understanding of cosmic filaments, which act as highways for gas and dark matter in the universe. These structures influence the development of galaxy clusters and individual galaxies over billions of years. The unique rotation of this filament may affect how galaxies align and rotate along its path.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers anticipate that further observations with advanced instruments will uncover additional filaments and even larger rotating systems, refining our understanding of the cosmic web and galaxy formation.</p>
