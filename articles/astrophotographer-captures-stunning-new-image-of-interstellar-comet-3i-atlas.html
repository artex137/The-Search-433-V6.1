      <h2>Astrophotographer Captures Stunning New Image of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On November 16, 2025, Satoru Murata, a member of the ICQ Comet Observations group, captured a new image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using a Celestron EdgeHD 800 telescope. The image was taken in New Mexico, United States, and shows the comet with three jets directed towards the Sun and one jet moving away from it.</p>

<p>This image of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks the third object and second comet confirmed to have originated outside the Solar System. The comet was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025. The comet’s orbit is noted for being the most dynamically extreme of any object recorded in the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) and A11pl3Z)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Image Captured:</strong> November 16, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope Used:</strong> Celestron EdgeHD 800</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Capture:</strong> New Mexico, United States</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Features:</strong> Three jets towards the Sun, one jet away from the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. It reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. Following this, Satoru Murata captured an image of the comet on November 16, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I captured the interstellar comet early morning as a thin crescent Moon passed immediately next to it,” said Murata. “Still was able to capture three separate jets of ionic tail, and an anti tail? Or the dust tail?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet was also passing by the galaxy NGC 4691, which really gave the impression of the object being from another world,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the second confirmed interstellar comet, following the discovery of 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) in 2017. This discovery has sparked interest in studying objects from outside the Solar System and their characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and studies of 3I/ATLAS are expected as astronomers analyze its unique features and trajectory.</p>
