      <h2>Harvard scientist’s wild Jupiter theory brings new mystery to interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has proposed a controversial theory regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, suggesting its unusual trajectory may indicate the presence of extraterrestrial technology. His claims, reported in the New York Post, have sparked interest and debate within the scientific community.</p>

<p>Loeb argues that the comet's path, which will bring it closest to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, could allow it to release satellites near the planet. This theory challenges conventional explanations about comet behaviour and raises questions about the potential for intelligent life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Proposed by:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li><strong>Key claim:</strong> Possible release of satellites by the comet</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's stance:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is just a comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has presented his theory regarding 3I/ATLAS in a recent article, suggesting that the comet's path could indicate it is dropping off observational devices near Jupiter. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<p>Loeb speculates that 3I/ATLAS may have performed a subtle course correction during its close approach to the sun, potentially using thruster-like jets. This hypothesis remains unverified, as the comet was not observable from Earth at that time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The coincidence of the comet arriving at exactly the right distance is too striking to ignore,” said Loeb regarding the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is just a comet,” NASA stated, maintaining a cautious stance on Loeb's claims.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's theory has gained traction as it taps into ongoing discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the behaviour of interstellar objects. Previous encounters with comets and asteroids have prompted scientific inquiry into their origins and characteristics, but the notion of intelligent design remains contentious within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb hopes that ongoing missions, such as NASA's Juno probe, may detect any unidentified objects after 3I/ATLAS passes. The findings could either support or challenge his theory regarding the comet's unusual behaviour and potential extraterrestrial connections.</p>
