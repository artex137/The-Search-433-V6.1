      <h2>Rare interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is recorded by satellite before its closest approach to the Sun</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, has been captured in images by the GOES-19 satellite as it approaches its closest point to the Sun. The comet is expected to reach perihelion on October 29, 2026, when it will be approximately 203 million kilometers from the Sun, within the orbit of Mars.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers as it provides a unique opportunity to study a cosmic object from another star system. The comet's hyperbolic orbit indicates it is a traveler from outside our solar system, and its passage may yield insights into the formation of distant planetary systems. The NOAA's GOES-19 satellite, primarily used for climate observation, recorded the comet using its coronagraph, revealing the capabilities of modern technology in astronomical research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was captured in images by the GOES-19 satellite on October 18, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach perihelion on October 29, 2026, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>On October 3, 2025, it crossed the orbit of Mars.</li>
    <li>It is expected to become visible in the morning sky starting November 11, 2026.</li>
    <li>The Juice probe from the European Space Agency (ESA) will observe the comet on November 2 and November 25, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified by astronomers on July 1, 2025, while positioned on the opposite side of the Sun. Observatories worldwide began tracking its trajectory to refine orbital calculations.</p>
<p>On October 3, 2025, 3I/ATLAS crossed the orbit of Mars, prompting monitoring to confirm trajectory models. The comet was captured in images by the GOES-19 satellite on October 18, 2025. It will reach perihelion on October 29, 2026, before entering solar conjunction on October 26, 2026.</p>
<p>After solar conjunction, observations will resume on November 8, 2026, with visibility expected from November 11, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The ability of meteorological equipment to perform such a significant astronomical observation highlights the versatility of in-orbit technology,” said Worachate Boonplod, a citizen scientist who identified the comet using publicly available data.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to cross our solar system, following previous discoveries that have provided valuable information about the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from other stellar systems. Its hyperbolic orbit distinguishes it from native comets that typically follow elliptical orbits.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, scientists will continue to monitor its activity and brightness. Observations from ground-based telescopes will resume in early November 2026, while the Juice probe will provide additional high-resolution data to further understand the comet's characteristics.</p>
