      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Unveils Unprecedented Radio Signal: Experts Are Baffled</h2>

<p>On 24 October 2025, South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope detected an unusual radio signal from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet produced a narrow-band hydroxyl absorption at 1665 and 1667 MHz, a frequency range known as the 'water hole.' This detection has puzzled astronomers, as no comet-like object has ever shown such a signature before.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it challenges established knowledge of cometary behavior. Authorities, including NASA and the Planetary Defense Coordination Office, are being urged to release all available data to provide transparency in the scientific community's investigation of this anomaly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of detection: 24 October 2025</li>
    <li>Location: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li>Signal frequency: 1665 and 1667 MHz</li>
    <li>Notable comparison: Previous interstellar objects like 1I/&#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov did not produce radio anomalies</li>
    <li>Next significant date: 19 December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 24 October 2025, MeerKAT radio telescope detected the signal from 3I/ATLAS. This detection revealed an unprecedented narrow-band hydroxyl absorption, leading to significant interest and concern among scientists.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches its perihelion, astronomers continue to monitor its activity, particularly looking ahead to 19 December 2025, when they hope to determine if the water hole frequencies will produce further signals.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The specificity of the signal, combined with its location in the water-hole range, has raised questions about whether the phenomenon is purely natural or something more,” a spokesperson from the astronomy community stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The public deserves transparency at a moment when the scientific community is grappling with whether humanity has witnessed a new kind of cosmic behaviour,” said a researcher advocating for data release.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, radio detections of comets have been rare, with only about twenty confirmed over the past fifty years, including notable comets like Kohoutek and Hale–Bopp. Previous detections typically involved natural emissions or reflections, making the narrow-band absorption signature of 3I/ATLAS particularly striking.</p>
<p>Other interstellar visitors, such as 1I/&#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, did not exhibit radio anomalies, highlighting the uniqueness of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS closely, particularly as 19 December approaches. If the signal repeats, it could represent a major breakthrough in planetary science.</p>
