      <h2>UFO Caught On Video Hovering Over Active Volcano In Mexico</h2>

<p>Video footage has captured an unidentified flying object (UFO) hovering over the Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico in late October. The glowing object was seen flying above the volcano, which is currently experiencing activity, before it zoomed away at high speed and disappeared. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this sighting.</p>

<p>The sighting has sparked excitement among UFO enthusiasts and experts. Authorities have not commented on the origin of the UFO, and the National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP) has reported low-intensity eruptions at the volcano on the same day as the sighting. They have advised the public to stay clear of the volcano's exclusion zone.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Location: Popocatepetl volcano, Morelos and Puebla, Mexico.</li>
    <li>Volcano altitude: 5,426 meters (17,801 feet).</li>
    <li>19 low-intensity eruptions reported on the same day as the UFO sighting.</li>
    <li>Exclusion zone around the volcano: 11.3 kilometers (7 miles).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2025, surveillance cameras captured the UFO hovering over the active Popocatepetl volcano. On the same day, the NCDP reported 19 low-intensity eruptions, accompanied by gases, vapor, and ash.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The public is advised to remain outside the exclusion zone,” said the NCDP regarding the ongoing volcanic activity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>UFO expert Jaime Maussan claimed that Popocatepetl serves as an “interdimensional portal,” suggesting that alien beings can travel through it.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Popocatepetl is one of Mexico's most active volcanoes. Jaime Maussan has previously suggested that the volcano's unique geological features, including magnetic storms, can create conditions for “Dimensional Portals.”</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to monitor the volcano's activity and have urged the public to adhere to safety guidelines while investigations into the UFO sighting remain ongoing.</p>
