      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS To Make Its Closest Approach To Earth Tonight</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth at 1:00 AM EST on December 19, 2025. Discovered on July 1 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope network in Chile, it is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the comet's unique origin and trajectory. Authorities, including the European Space Agency, have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth during its approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach time:</strong> 1:00 AM EST on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Safety distance:</strong> 170 miles, significantly farther than the distance between the Earth and the Moon</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Requires a telescope with a minimum aperture of 30 centimeters</li>
    <li><strong>Viewing direction:</strong> East to northeast, just below the star Regulus in the constellation Leo</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope network in Chile. Following its discovery, scientists calculated its orbit and confirmed its interstellar origin. The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 1:00 AM EST.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet will not collide with Earth, as the distance is humongous,” said a representative from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its steep trajectory indicates that it originates from outside our solar system and will leave permanently after its approach.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to prepare their telescopes for viewing 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach. Further observations may provide insights into the characteristics of this interstellar object.</p>
