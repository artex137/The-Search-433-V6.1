      <h2>3I/ATLAS Coma Expansion Observed in New Images</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, captured on December 2, 2025, have revealed significant changes in its coma, prompting questions about its expansion. The images show a symmetric coma with no visible tail and smooth gradients, according to Chuck’s Astrophotography.</p>

<p>This discovery is important for scientists studying interstellar comets. The new features observed in 3I/ATLAS's coma may provide insights into its origin, activity, and trajectory as it moves away from the Sun. Researchers are particularly interested in how 3I/ATLAS compares to other known interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>New images were captured on December 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is currently approximately 2.4 AU from Earth and 2.9 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It travels at nearly 60 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The coma intensity is reported at 88 percent, with tail visibility at 22 percent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies confirmed its interstellar origin. The object passed perihelion on October 29, 2025, and has since been moving outward from the inner Solar System. New observations on December 2, 2025, have shown changes in its coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new images are significant for understanding the behaviour of interstellar nuclei under solar heating,” a spokesperson for NASA stated. “They help track dust coma evolution in high-speed objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following ʻOumuamua and Borisov. Its discovery has heightened interest in the study of interstellar comets and their characteristics. Unlike typical long-period comets in our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS displays a unique coma profile and activity patterns.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for further activity shifts and changes in its coma as it travels on its hyperbolic orbit, which ensures it will not return to the Solar System.</p>
