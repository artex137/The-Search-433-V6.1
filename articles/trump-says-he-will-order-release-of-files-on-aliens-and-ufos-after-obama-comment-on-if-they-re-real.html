      <h2>Trump to Release UFO Files Following Obama Comments</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to order the release of government documents related to extraterrestrial life and unidentified flying objects (UFOs) after comments made by former President Barack Obama. Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday, stating he was uncertain about the existence of aliens but accused Obama of disclosing "classified information" about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This announcement comes as Congress and federal agencies have increased their focus on what are now officially termed unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). The recent interest in UAPs has prompted calls for transparency regarding government knowledge and investigations into these sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> February 20, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Trump's comments made on Air Force One</li>
    <li>Obama's remarks made during a podcast interview</li>
    <li>Trump directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to begin file releases</li>
    <li>Congress has held multiple hearings on UAPs in recent years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 20, 2026, President Trump announced plans to release government documents regarding aliens and UFOs. This followed comments from former President Obama during a podcast where he stated that aliens are real but clarified that he had seen no evidence of communication with them during his presidency.</p>
<p>Obama's comments drew significant media attention over the weekend, prompting Trump's response shortly thereafter. In his remarks, Trump referred to the "tremendous interest" in the subject and accused Obama of revealing classified information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He made a big mistake — he took it out of classified information,” Trump said, referring to Obama’s comments. “No, I don’t have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Obama stated, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them,” during a podcast interview, later clarifying that statistically, the “odds are good” that other life exists due to the size of the universe.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UFOs and UAPs has fluctuated over the years, with Congress recently holding several hearings to address the topic. A significant hearing occurred in the fall of 2023, focusing on transparency and whistleblower protection related to UAPs. In 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence submitted a report to Congress but noted limitations in drawing conclusions about UAPs.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has also taken steps to improve transparency, including launching a website to share declassified information on UAPs with the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Trump's directive to release files on UFOs and extraterrestrial life is expected to proceed through the Department of Defense and other agencies. The response from Congress and the public will likely shape the ongoing discussion regarding UAPs and transparency in government investigations.</p>
