      <h2>‘Is that a UFO?’ Oklahoma family spot bizarre other-worldly sighting in night sky</h2>

<p>A family in Oklahoma has captured a bizarre object in the night sky on Monday, October 16, 2023, at approximately 7:30 PM CT. The sighting, which was recorded by Steve Aragona, drew the attention of his children and neighbours, who questioned the nature of the unexplained phenomenon. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting has gained attention on social media, with a TikTok video amassing nearly half a million views. The video raises questions about unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, as authorities continue to investigate reports of similar sightings. Local news outlet KFOR has received the full-length video from Aragona, who described the moment he noticed the object.</p>
