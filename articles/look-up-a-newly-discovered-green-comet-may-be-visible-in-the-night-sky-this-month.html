      <h2>Look Up! A Newly Discovered Green Comet May Be Visible in the Night Sky This Month</h2>

<p>Comet Lemmon (C/2025 A6), discovered in Arizona, will make its closest approach to Earth on October 21, 2023. The comet is expected to be visible to stargazers in dark, non-light-polluted skies around October 31 or November 1.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomy enthusiasts, as Comet Lemmon is predicted to brighten significantly toward the end of October. Authorities, including astronomers at the Mt. Lemmon SkyCenter, are encouraging the public to observe the comet, especially during its peak visibility period coinciding with the Orionids meteor shower.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Lemmon (C/2025 A6) discovered in January 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: October 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>Expected peak visibility: October 31 or November 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet reaches closest point to the sun: November 8, 2023.</li>
    <li>Visible with binoculars or a telescope in early October.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon was discovered by astronomers at the Mt. Lemmon SkyCenter in the Santa Catalina Mountains of Arizona in January 2023. The comet follows a 1,350-year orbit around the sun and has begun its path underneath the Big Dipper in the constellation Ursa Major.</p>
<p>The comet will be closest to Earth on October 21, coinciding with the peak of the Orionids meteor shower. It is expected to brighten significantly as it approaches Earth, making it potentially visible to the naked eye by the end of October.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To catch the comet during the first half of the month, look up in the early morning hours before sunrise,” according to EarthSky.org.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon is part of a notable celestial event this October, alongside the Orionids meteor shower. Previous comets have garnered public interest, and this event is expected to attract stargazers eager to witness a once-in-a-lifetime sighting.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches its closest point to the sun on November 8, astronomers will continue to monitor its brightness and visibility. Public interest in the comet is anticipated to grow as it becomes more visible in the night sky.</p>
