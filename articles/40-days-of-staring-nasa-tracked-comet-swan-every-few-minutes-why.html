      <h2>40 Days of Staring: NASA Tracked Comet SWAN Every Few Minutes — Why?</h2>

<p>NASA has tracked Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) for nearly 40 days, capturing its journey through the inner solar system every four minutes from August 25 to October 2, 2023. The PUNCH mission, which consists of four small satellites, has provided unprecedented insights into the comet's behavior and structure.</p>

<p>This extended observation marks a significant advancement in comet tracking, a practice traditionally conducted at a much slower rate. The data collected could enhance our understanding of solar winds and their effects on Earth, according to NASA officials. The mission highlights the importance of real-time data in studying cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was discovered by Vladimir Bezugly in September 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA's PUNCH mission tracked the comet every four minutes for 40 days.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its closest point to the sun on September 10, 2023, at a distance of 46.74 million miles (75.20 million km).</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth was on October 30, 2023, at a distance of 25.10 million miles (40.38 million km).</li>
    <li>The PUNCH mission aims to map the solar corona and its transition into the solar wind.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was first spotted on September 1, 2023, by amateur astronomer Vladimir Bezugly. The comet passed its perihelion on September 10, 2023, just a day after its discovery. NASA began its intensive tracking campaign on August 25, 2023, and continued until October 2, 2023.</p>
<p>During this period, the comet exhibited a triangular "hammerhead" shape, raising concerns about its stability. The PUNCH mission captured continuous data, which included images of the comet gliding between Mars and the star Spica in Virgo.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What's new here is the few-minute cadence of observation,” said Craig DeForest, principal investigator for the PUNCH mission at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Watching the sun's effects from multiple vantage points — and with different types of instruments — is what gives us a complete picture of the space environment,” stated Gina DiBraccio, acting director of the Solar System Exploration Division at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, comets have been tracked at a rate of once per day. The PUNCH mission's ability to observe comets every few minutes represents a major leap in the capability to monitor cosmic events. Comet SWAN's unusual shape suggests it may be fragmenting, which is critical for astronomers studying the life cycle of comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The PUNCH mission will continue to analyze the data collected during the tracking of Comet SWAN. This research will contribute to a better understanding of solar winds and their potential impacts on Earth's technology and environment.</p>
