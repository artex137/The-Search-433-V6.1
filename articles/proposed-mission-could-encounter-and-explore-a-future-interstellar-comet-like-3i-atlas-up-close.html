      <h2>Proposed mission could encounter and explore a future interstellar comet like 3I/ATLAS up close</h2>

<p>Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has completed a mission study detailing a potential spacecraft flyby of an interstellar comet, specifically targeting 3I/ATLAS, which could yield significant scientific insights into objects from beyond the solar system. The study, released on September 25, 2025, outlines the mission design and scientific objectives for the spacecraft.</p>

<p>This proposed mission is significant as it aims to enhance understanding of the properties of interstellar objects (ISO). According to SwRI, the study has validated the mission concept using the recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS, showing that this comet could have been intercepted and observed by the proposed spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)</li>
    <li><strong>Mission study completion date:</strong> September 25, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Comet targeted:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Interstellar objects (ISO)</li>
    <li><strong>Objectives:</strong> Understand properties of bodies from beyond the solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>SwRI has conducted a mission study that details the design and objectives for a spacecraft to fly by an interstellar comet. The study focused on 3I/ATLAS, which has been discovered recently.</p>
<p>The research team has validated the mission concept, confirming that the spacecraft could have intercepted and observed 3I/ATLAS during its journey.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The mission design and scientific objectives are based on previous ISO detections,” said a representative from SwRI. “Using the recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS, we have determined that our proposed spacecraft could have successfully studied this interstellar comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study builds on a growing interest in interstellar objects, particularly following the detection of 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These discoveries have opened new avenues for research into the origins and characteristics of celestial bodies from outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>SwRI plans to continue refining the mission design and objectives while seeking potential partnerships and funding for the proposed spacecraft.</p>
