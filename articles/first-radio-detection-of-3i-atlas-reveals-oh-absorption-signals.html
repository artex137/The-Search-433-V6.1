      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-09 11:40 UTC</p>

      <h2>First radio detection of 3I/ATLAS reveals OH absorption signals</h2>

<p>The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa has achieved the first confirmed radio detection of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, with observations made on October 24, 2025. The detection, reported by D.J. Pisano and collaborators in The Astronomer’s Telegram, identifies hydroxyl (OH) absorption lines at specific radio frequencies, marking a significant advancement in understanding the comet's properties.</p>

<p>This finding is crucial as it confirms the presence of OH molecules interacting with radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has stated that this detection sets a foundation for future studies of interstellar objects. The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, which operates MeerKAT, has confirmed the presence of these absorption features.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li>Distance of 3I/ATLAS from the Sun: 3.76 degrees</li>
    <li>Radio frequencies of detected lines: 1.665 and 1.667 gigahertz</li>
    <li>Doppler velocity shifts: -15.59 (+/-0.16) and -15.65 (+/-0.17) km/s</li>
    <li>Surface temperature of 3I/ATLAS: approximately 230 Kelvin</li>
    <li>Next close approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026, at a distance of 53 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 20 and 28, 2025, previous observation attempts using MeerKAT did not yield detectable OH absorption signatures. The successful detection on October 24 marked the first radio observation of this type for 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>Prior to the successful observation, the solar conjunction of 3I/ATLAS relative to Earth occurred on October 21, 2025. This event placed the object’s motion nearly perpendicular to the telescope's line-of-sight, affecting the measurements.</p>
<p>Loeb had encouraged radio observatories to monitor 3I/ATLAS five weeks before the detection, noting its trajectory closely matched the position of the 1977 “Wow!” signal.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “This detection constitutes the first radio confirmation of 3I/ATLAS and establishes a confirmed data set for subsequent radio investigations.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of hydroxyl absorption lines in 3I/ATLAS is significant as it contributes to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects. Previous studies have focused primarily on visual and infrared observations, making this radio detection a novel approach to characterizing such objects.</p>
<p>Loeb emphasized the importance of monitoring interstellar objects, as they can provide insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following this detection, additional monitoring efforts are planned for 3I/ATLAS, particularly during its close approach to Jupiter in March 2026. NASA's Juno vehicle will utilize its dipole antenna to search for emissions at frequencies between 50 hertz and 40 megahertz.</p>
