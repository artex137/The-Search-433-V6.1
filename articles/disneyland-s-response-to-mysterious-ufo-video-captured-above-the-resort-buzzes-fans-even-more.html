      <h2>Disneyland's Response To Mysterious "UFO" Video Captured Above The Resort Buzzes Fans Even More</h2>

<p>A circular ring floating above Disneyland Resort in Anaheim has sparked speculation about UFOs after it was captured on video by early morning drivers on Thursday. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the sighting.</p>

<p>The incident has gained significant attention online, particularly as it follows a series of unsettling events at Disney World Florida. Disneyland officials have clarified that the ring is not of extraterrestrial origin but is a byproduct of a pyrotechnic test conducted before the park opened. The explanation has reignited discussions about the park's behind-the-scenes magic.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred around 6:30 a.m. on Thursday</li>
    <li>Location: Disneyland Resort, Anaheim, California</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities reported</li>
    <li>Pyrotechnic test confirmed as the source of the ring</li>
    <li>Previous similar sightings noted by Disneyland fans</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday morning, a dark circular ring was spotted rising above Disneyland Resort, capturing the attention of drivers and sparking widespread online discussion. The resort quickly responded, confirming that the ring was a result of a pyrotechnic test.</p>

<p>The first person to share footage of the ring was Lori Nayahalski, who noted its unusual appearance and questioned its nature. Disneyland's clarification followed shortly after, dispelling rumors of a UFO.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "It wasn't dissipating, nor was it a flock of birds. Real life Matrix or just an orchestrated spoof... I don't know, but it was something," said Lori Nayahalski in an interview with KTLA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time guests have reported seeing similar rings over Disneyland. Longtime visitors have recognized that these phenomena often occur after specific fire sequences in nighttime shows like World of Color and Fantasmic!. The phenomenon is a result of fire-based pyrotechnics that can create smoke rings visible from surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Fans have noted that the rings can appear particularly striking under certain lighting conditions, making them seem more mysterious to casual visitors who may not be aware of the park's extensive production work.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Disneyland has not disclosed any plans for further investigations or changes to its pyrotechnic practices following this incident. However, the park may continue to address public curiosity about its nighttime shows and their effects.</p>
