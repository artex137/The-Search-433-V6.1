      <h2>Astronomer Suspects Mysterious Object Is Up to No Good While It's Hidden Behind the Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its perihelion on October 29, 2023, as it travels through our solar system. The object recently reached solar conjunction, placing it on the exact opposite side of the Sun from Earth. While scientists have largely identified it as a comet made primarily of carbon dioxide ice, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has raised concerns that it could be an extraterrestrial "mothership."</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the nature of the object and its potential implications for humanity. Authorities and scientists continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, particularly its trajectory and behaviour as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Current Position:</strong> Solar conjunction, opposite side of the Sun from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Primary Composition:</strong> Carbon dioxide ice</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Figure:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astronomer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to reports, 3I/ATLAS reached solar conjunction earlier this week, positioning it opposite Earth. The object is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun, or perihelion, on October 29, 2023. Loeb has expressed concerns about the object's trajectory and potential capabilities.</p>
<p>Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS may use the Sun's gravitational pull to alter its velocity, possibly releasing smaller probes during its perihelion. He emphasizes the importance of monitoring the object in November and December 2025 for unusual activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If you want to take a vacation, take it before [October 29], because who knows what will happen?” 
    — Avi Loeb, Harvard astronomer
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know.” 
    — Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's hypothesis about 3I/ATLAS being an alien spacecraft has sparked skepticism within the scientific community. While he acknowledges there is only a slim chance of this theory being true, he maintains that the possibility must be taken seriously due to its implications for humanity.</p>
<p>Statler has noted that, despite its unusual properties, 3I/ATLAS fits the profile of known comets. The debate continues as scientists weigh the evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. The focus will be on monitoring for any unusual activity or changes in trajectory in November and December 2025.</p>
