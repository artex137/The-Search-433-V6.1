      <h2>Could the remains of a 'dead' comet still be in the solar system? Astronomers are still searching 6 years later</h2>

<p>Astronomers have continued their search for remnants of the comet C/2019 Y4 ATLAS, which broke apart in April 2020, six years after its discovery. The comet was first detected in December 2019 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and was expected to provide a spectacular view as it approached Earth.</p>

<p>The fate of C/2019 Y4 remains uncertain, but researchers are investigating whether a fragment of the comet could still be orbiting in the solar system. A team led by Salvatore A. Cordova Quijano from Boston University has conducted observations to determine if any substantial pieces remain after the comet's disintegration.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2019 Y4 ATLAS discovered in December 2019.</li>
    <li>Comet broke apart in late April 2020, shortly before its closest approach to the sun.</li>
    <li>Last observed debris was recorded on June 8, 2020, from NASA's STEREO spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted using the Lowell Discovery Telescope and the Zwicky Transient Facility in August and October 2020 turned up no new findings.</li>
    <li>Researchers have suggested a fragment less than half a kilometer wide could still exist in orbit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>December 2019: C/2019 Y4 ATLAS is discovered by ATLAS.</p>
<p>April 2020: The comet begins to break apart as it approaches the sun.</p>
<p>June 8, 2020: The last observation of any debris from the comet is made by NASA's STEREO spacecraft.</p>
<p>August and October 2020: Astronomers scan the skies for remnants of the comet but find no evidence of significant fragments.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We cannot conclude from the available data whether any sizable fragments still exist,” wrote Cordova Quijano and his co-authors in their recent study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The breakup of C/2019 Y4 ATLAS raises questions about the survival of comets in the solar system. Previous studies have suggested that disrupted comets may still have surviving fragments that are inactive and smaller in size. This case provides an opportunity to explore the dynamics of comet disintegration and the potential for remnants to remain in orbit.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor the skies for any signs of C/2019 Y4's remnants. Further observations may help clarify the fate of the comet's nucleus and provide insights into the behaviors of comets near the sun.</p>
