      <h2>Donald Trump’s UFO Speech Planned for July</h2>

<p>US President Donald Trump has reportedly prepared a speech to disclose alleged evidence of UFOs and extraterrestrial life, according to ufologist Mark Christopher Lee. The announcement is expected to take place on 8 July 2026, coinciding with the 79th anniversary of the Roswell incident.</p>

<p>This speech is significant as it may reveal decades of alleged evidence regarding unexplained aerial phenomena, including materials recovered from crash sites and military eyewitness accounts. Authorities are currently monitoring the situation, as the timing of the speech could impact international relations.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
