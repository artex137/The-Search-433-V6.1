      <h2>Comet or alien tech? What China’s Mars orbiter Tianwen-1 images reveal about 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>China’s Mars orbiter, Tianwen-1, has captured the first close-up images of Comet 3I/Atlas during its flyby of Mars on October 3, 2025. The comet has attracted attention over the past few months, with some speculating about its origins, including claims of potential alien technology.</p>

<p>The images taken by Tianwen-1 provide scientists with valuable data about Comet 3I/Atlas, the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our Solar System. The findings may help clarify the comet's characteristics and trajectory, as well as address the speculation surrounding its nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet passed within approximately 28 million kilometers of Mars.</li>
    <li>Tianwen-1 has been orbiting Mars since 2021.</li>
    <li>NASA has not yet provided clear information regarding the comet’s origins or nature.</li>
    <li>Other space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency, have also captured images of 3I/Atlas, with releases pending due to the US government shutdown.</li>
    <li>The comet emits gas and has a nucleus estimated to be between several hundred meters to under a kilometer wide.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/Atlas was first detected by ATLAS in Chile. It became the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our Solar System. On October 3, 2025, Tianwen-1 captured close-up images of the comet during its flyby of Mars, providing scientists with the opportunity to analyze its unique characteristics.</p>

<p>The comet’s trajectory is hyperbolic, indicating it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun and will exit the Solar System after its encounter with Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>The images show a bright coma surrounding an icy nucleus, which distinguishes 3I/Atlas from typical Solar System comets, according to researchers studying the data.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has sparked significant interest due to its unusual trajectory and the speculation surrounding its nature. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have also generated discussions about extraterrestrial life and technology. The current interest in 3I/Atlas reflects ongoing curiosity about the cosmos and humanity's place within it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from Tianwen-1's images. Further investigations may follow as additional images from other spacecraft are released once the US government shutdown concludes.</p>
