      <h2>NASA unveils stunning image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has released a new image of Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor traveling at a speed of 209,214.72 kilometers per hour, as it approaches Earth. This comet, which originated outside our galaxy, will pass by Earth on December 19th, 2023, at a safe distance of 170 million miles.</p>

<p>The release of this image has generated significant interest, especially due to the appearance of five bright spots surrounding the comet. While some speculate about potential alien technology, scientists suggest these may result from camera diffraction or other optical effects. NASA aims to study this comet further, as it is only the third interstellar object to enter our solar system since 2017.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at 209,214.72 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass by Earth on December 19th, 2023, at a distance of 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>This is the third interstellar object to enter our solar system since 2017.</li>
    <li>Twelve NASA spacecraft have been involved in tracking the comet since July 1st.</li>
    <li>The closest images of the comet were taken from Mars, 19 million miles away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified as it entered the solar system. NASA began tracking the comet on July 1st, 2023, as part of its largest observation campaign to date. Observations have included images taken from various NASA spacecraft, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN orbiter, and the Perseverance rover.</p>

<p>On December 19th, the comet will pass by Earth, providing a unique opportunity for further observations and studies by scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It opens a new door to understanding the composition and history of other solar systems,” said NASA's Tom Statler regarding the significance of Comet 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to Comet 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects have been recorded entering our solar system since 2017. These events have sparked considerable scientific interest in the origins and compositions of celestial bodies from outside our galaxy.</p>

<p>With the ongoing investigation into 3I/ATLAS, scientists hope to gain insights into how life formed in the universe and how other solar systems differ from our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue observing Comet 3I/ATLAS, with the James Webb Space Telescope set to examine it in detail in December. More findings are expected to be released as the investigation progresses.</p>
