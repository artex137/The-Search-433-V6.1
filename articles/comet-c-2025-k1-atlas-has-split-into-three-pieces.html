      <h2>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) Has Split Into Three Pieces</h2>

<p>Italian astronomers have captured footage of Comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS breaking apart at the Asiago Observatory on November 11-12, 2025. The comet, which passed close to the sun on October 8, has fragmented into three pieces, approximately 2,000 km apart.</p>

<p>This event is significant for scientists studying the solar system's formation. The breakup has exposed unaltered material from the comet's interior, providing a rare opportunity to analyze its chemical composition and gain insights into the early solar nebula. Researchers have noted that the fragments are not a threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS was observed breaking apart on November 11-12, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's breakup occurred after a solar pass on October 8, 2025.</li>
    <li>The fragments of the comet are about 2,000 km apart, roughly the distance from Chicago to Miami.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered in May 2025 and never became visible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>Italian astronomers used the 1.82m Copernicus telescope for the observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The following events led to the comet's fragmentation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>**May 2025**: Comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS is discovered.</li>
    <li>**October 8, 2025**: The comet passes close to the sun, vaporizing subsurface ice and causing structural stress.</li>
    <li>**November 11-12, 2025**: Astronomers at the Asiago Observatory capture the breakup of the comet in real-time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"What we expected to be routine monitoring turned into documentation of a rare breakup event," said Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS is believed to have originated in the Kuiper Belt. This region contains many icy bodies and is known for being the source of comets. Breakups of comets are rare and often occur too quickly or too far from Earth to observe in detail. The exposure of pristine material from the comet's interior makes this event particularly valuable for scientific research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct spectroscopic analysis of the exposed interior material to determine the comet's chemical composition. This analysis will provide insights into the elements and compounds present during the early formation of the solar system.</p>
