      <h2>Big Revelation on Comet 3I/ATLAS: Scientists Say the Interstellar Object May Be Older Than the Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention from scientists after studies have indicated it may be older than the Sun, potentially dating back as far as 14 billion years. Researchers at the University of Canterbury and the University of Oxford have analyzed the comet's motion and composition, suggesting its origins may be linked to the early universe.</p>

<p>This discovery is crucial as it provides insights into the formation of solid bodies in the cosmos and the conditions of the early universe. The findings could enhance our understanding of star formation and the survival of celestial objects over billions of years. Researchers are continuing to study the comet's characteristics to confirm its age and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 8-14 billion years old.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in the solar system.</li>
    <li>It follows a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it will not return to the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet was analyzed by researchers from the University of Canterbury and the University of Oxford.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted using the Two-Meter Twin Telescope at the Teide Observatory.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected as it entered the solar system, following a hyperbolic trajectory. Researchers began analyzing its motion and composition, leading to age estimates that suggest it may predate the Sun. Key observations were made using advanced telescopes, culminating in detailed studies during its closest approach to Earth in December 2025.</p>

<p>The comet's unusual physical behavior was documented over 37 nights, revealing jet-like structures and a consistent rotation period of approximately 15.5 hours. This information supports the hypothesis that the comet has a stable internal structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The most striking claim regarding 3I/ATLAS is its estimated age range of 8-14 billion years,” said Michele Bannister from the University of Canterbury.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Current observations are fully consistent with natural astrophysical processes,” researchers emphasized regarding the comet’s origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, astronomers had confirmed only two interstellar visitors: 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Both of these objects exhibited unusual properties but did not yield age estimates nearing that of the universe.</p>

<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS suggests that interstellar objects may be more common in the galaxy than previously believed, although their faintness makes them difficult to observe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. The findings will help refine models of cosmic formation and evolution. Once the comet departs the solar system, it is unlikely to be observed again, marking a significant moment in the study of interstellar objects.</p>
