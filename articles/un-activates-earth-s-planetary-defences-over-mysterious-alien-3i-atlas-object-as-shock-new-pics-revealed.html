      <h2>UN activates Earth’s planetary defences over mysterious comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The United Nations has confirmed that Earth’s planetary defences will be tested as the comet 3I/ATLAS approaches, reaching its closest point on December 19. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>This initiative aims to prepare for potential future asteroids that could threaten Earth. A global team of scientists plans to track the comet over a two-month campaign, which began on November 27 and will continue until January 27, 2026. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has classified this operation as a major drill.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will be closest to Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>The comet is over seven billion years old.</li>
    <li>It was first discovered on July 1 by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be the size of Manhattan and has a mass of approximately 33 billion tonnes.</li>
    <li>It is travelling at an approximate speed of 125,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Observations will continue until January 27, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2023. Following its discovery, NASA and IAWN began preparations for tracking the comet. The IAWN commenced its observational campaign on November 27, 2023, focusing on the comet until January 27, 2026. The closest approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and high interest to the scientific community,” said a representative from IAWN.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet is the third interstellar object to enter our solar system, following previous unidentified objects. NASA is currently developing a comprehensive Earth shield system, which includes telescopes, radar systems, satellites, and machine learning technologies, aimed at detecting and deflecting potential threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue as part of the IAWN initiative, with further testing of the Earth shield system scheduled for December 29, 2023. Authorities will monitor the comet's trajectory and assess any potential risks associated with its approach.</p>
