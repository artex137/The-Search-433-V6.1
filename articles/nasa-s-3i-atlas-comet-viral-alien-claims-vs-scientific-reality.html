      <h2>NASA's 3I/Atlas Comet: Viral Alien Claims vs Scientific Reality</h2>

<p>NASA's 3I/Atlas comet, discovered on 1 July 2025, has sparked widespread panic on social media as users circulate theories about an impending alien invasion. The comet, traveling at speeds of 210,000 kilometres per hour, will reach perihelion on 30 October 2025, skimming 210 million kilometres from the Sun, well within Mars' orbit. Authorities have confirmed there is no risk of collision with Earth.</p>

<p>Experts have urged calm amidst the online hysteria, stating that the comet poses no threat to Earth. The comet's unusual characteristics have ignited conspiracy theories, but scientists insist these claims lack evidence. NASA and other space agencies are actively monitoring the comet's trajectory and composition to gather data on its origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was first spotted on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It travels at speeds of 210,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is set for 30 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass 210 million kilometres from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It will approach Earth at a safe distance of 270 million kilometres on 21 July 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's SPHEREx mission is gathering data on the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers using NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered the 3I/Atlas comet, marking it as the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. By 29 September 2025, social media users began circulating conspiracy theories, claiming the comet was an alien mothership or engineered probe. In response, scientists confirmed that there is no risk to Earth and that the comet exhibits typical cometary behaviour.</p>

<p>As of 6 October 2025, telescopes worldwide are tracking 3I/Atlas during its close pass by Mars, collecting valuable data on its composition and origins. Media outlets have debunked various alarmist claims, reassuring the public about the comet's nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We're not really sure where it's going to end up until it comes around from the other side of the sun, and starts heading out to the outer solar system again,” said a NASA spokesperson, emphasizing the importance of scientific monitoring.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The comet poses zero threat, with its closest approach to Earth being over 1.7 times the Earth-Sun distance,” confirmed a representative from the European Space Agency (ESA).</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the discovery of the 3I/Atlas comet, similar incidents have occurred where social media speculation has outpaced scientific understanding, often leading to widespread misinformation. The blending of pseudoscience with genuine cosmic phenomena has been a recurring trend, especially during significant astronomical events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches perihelion and exits the solar system. Ongoing analysis will focus on its composition and any potential implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>
