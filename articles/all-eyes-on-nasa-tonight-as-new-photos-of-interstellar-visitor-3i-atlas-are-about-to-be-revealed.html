      <h2>All eyes on NASA tonight as new photos of interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS are about to be revealed</h2>

<p>People around the world are waiting for NASA to unveil new photos and information about 3I/ATLAS, a comet traveling through our Solar System, at 9 p.m. Paris time tonight. Scientists have identified 3I/ATLAS as the third interstellar comet ever discovered.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it may provide insight into the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which has generated considerable curiosity. While some speculate it could be an artifact from an alien civilization, scientists assert there is no evidence supporting this claim. They suggest the most plausible explanation is that it is a very old, cold chunk of rock and ice from another star system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> NASA photo and information release</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Tonight, at 9 p.m. Paris time</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery method:</strong> Detected by ATLAS robotic telescopes</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Contains high levels of carbon dioxide</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Moving much faster than typical Solar System objects</li>
    <li><strong>Observatories involved:</strong> Hubble Telescope and James Webb Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system, which is designed to monitor the sky for moving objects. Following its detection, scientists confirmed it was not native to our Solar System, generating significant media attention.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist known for his controversial views on interstellar objects, drew public interest to the comet after discussing its discovery. His previous claims regarding the interstellar object ʻOumuamua as a potential alien probe contrasted with the scientific consensus.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to tonight's event, both the Hubble and James Webb telescopes have conducted observations of 3I/ATLAS, revealing it contains more carbon dioxide than most comets found near Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Most scientists think tonight's update will confirm it's a natural comet. But many are still curious, especially as interstellar objects are so rare.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar comets is rare, with only two previous objects identified before 3I/ATLAS. The scientific community continues to study these objects to gain insights into the formation of our Solar System and others.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb's advocacy for the possibility of extraterrestrial artifacts has sparked debate within the scientific community, often overshadowing more conventional interpretations of such discoveries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's live update tonight will provide new images and information about 3I/ATLAS. Scientists will analyze the data to further understand the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>
