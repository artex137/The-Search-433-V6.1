      <h2>Ice Volcanoes Erupt on Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>Researchers have observed ice volcano eruptions on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, providing new insights into its composition and behavior. The findings emerged as the comet neared its perihelion, the point at which it is closest to the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for scientists studying the comet, as it adds to the understanding of its surface chemistry and geological activity. Authorities have noted that the comet's behavior challenges previous theories, including those suggesting it might be an alien artifact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently near its perihelion.</li>
    <li>Ice volcanoes have been observed ejecting gas and debris.</li>
    <li>Research conducted using the Joan Oró Telescope in Spain.</li>
    <li>Findings have not yet been peer-reviewed.</li>
    <li>Comet will pass Earth later this month and head towards Jupiter in 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, researchers have monitored its activity, noting significant gas and debris ejections. The comet has displayed a dual tail phenomenon, forming both a normal tail and an anti-tail. These observations have led to the conclusion that the surface of the comet is experiencing cryovolcanic activity.</p>
<p>Josep Trigo-Rodríguez, the lead researcher, has indicated that the internal processes of the comet may be driven by the sublimation of carbon dioxide ice reacting with metals beneath the surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet’s surface chemistry looks similar to that of trans-Neptunian objects lurking in the Kuiper Belt,” said Josep Trigo-Rodríguez, lead researcher on the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery follows ongoing interest in 3I/ATLAS, which has puzzled scientists since its discovery. Its unusual characteristics have led to various hypotheses about its origin and nature, including the possibility of it being an alien artifact, a theory that has gained less traction with recent findings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are racing against time to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS before it moves away from the inner solar system. The team plans to continue observations to unravel the remaining mysteries of this interstellar visitor.</p>
