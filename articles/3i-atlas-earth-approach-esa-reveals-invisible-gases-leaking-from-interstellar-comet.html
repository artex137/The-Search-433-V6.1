      <h2>3I/ATLAS Earth Approach: ESA Reveals 'Invisible' Gases Leaking From Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has captured a detailed image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on 3 December 2025 from a distance of 283 million kilometres. The comet is set for its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025 at 06:02 Universal Time, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the composition of 3I/ATLAS, which is believed to be at least 7 billion years old. The data gathered may help scientists understand the comet's origins and the early conditions of the galaxy. ESA's XMM-Newton mission utilized the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) to observe the comet's coma, revealing gases that are difficult to detect by other means.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was imaged on 3 December 2025 from 283 million kilometres away.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on 19 December 2025 at 06:02 Universal Time.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be at least 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet passed 0.19 Astronomical Units from Mars on 3 October 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS weighs approximately 44 million metric tons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Chile. Following its discovery, astronomers coordinated a global observation campaign, allowing detailed tracking of the comet.</p>
<p>On 3 October 2025, 3I/ATLAS passed 0.19 Astronomical Units from Mars, providing a unique viewing opportunity for instruments on Martian orbit and NASA's Perseverance rover.</p>
<p>The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on 19 December 2025, before continuing its journey toward the star Zeta Geminorum in the constellation Gemini.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This makes X-ray observations a powerful tool. They allow scientists to detect and study gases that other instruments can't easily spot,” the ESA explained in a recent press release.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects, following the detection of 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017. The advancements in observation techniques, such as those used by the ESA, have opened new avenues for studying these ancient celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS prepares to depart the inner solar system, scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from its observations. Future surveys, like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are expected to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
