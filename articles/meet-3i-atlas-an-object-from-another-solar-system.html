      <h2>Meet 3I/ATLAS, An Object From Another Solar System</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered an interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS whizzing past Jupiter earlier this summer. This marks only the third interstellar object ever observed, and it is expected to leave the solar system by the end of the year.</p>

<p>This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the universe. Scientists are racing to gather as much information as possible about 3I/ATLAS before it departs, as it may provide insights into the formation of other solar systems and our own. Researchers are also studying samples from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu to learn more about its origins and what they reveal about our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery: 3I/ATLAS was detected earlier this summer.</li>
    <li>Location: The object is currently near Jupiter.</li>
    <li>Expected Departure: It will leave the solar system by the end of 2023.</li>
    <li>Significance: It is only the third interstellar object ever observed.</li>
    <li>Related Research: Studies on asteroid Bennu have found stardust older than our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS earlier this summer, based on its orbit and speed. This discovery follows the detection of other interstellar objects, including ʻOumuamua, which sparked various theories about its nature.</p>

<p>In addition to studying 3I/ATLAS, researchers have been analyzing samples from the asteroid Bennu for the past two years. This work has revealed stardust from ancient exploding stars, providing a glimpse into the early universe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The race is on to learn as much as we can about 3I/ATLAS before it leaves our solar system,” said Dr. Stefanie Milam, an astrochemist at NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Our analysis of Bennu samples has found stardust that is older than our solar system,” stated Dr. Jessica Barnes, an Associate Professor at the University of Arizona.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects is rare, with only two previous observations before 3I/ATLAS. The object ʻOumuamua, detected in 2017, generated significant interest and debate regarding its potential origins, including theories of it being an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>Research on asteroids like Bennu has also gained attention, as it provides valuable information about the building blocks of our solar system and its history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study 3I/ATLAS until its departure, focusing on its composition and trajectory. Research on Bennu will also proceed, with further analysis expected to yield more findings about its ancient materials and implications for planetary science.</p>
