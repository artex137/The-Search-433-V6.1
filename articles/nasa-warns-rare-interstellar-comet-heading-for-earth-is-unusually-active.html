      <h2>NASA warns rare interstellar comet heading for Earth is 'unusually active'</h2>

<p>NASA has issued a warning that a rare interstellar comet, named 3I/ATLAS, is currently heading towards Earth and is exhibiting "unusually active" behaviour. The comet was first spotted by researchers in early July, although it had been visible on other telescopes as early as May, according to Live Science.</p>

<p>This warning matters because the increased brightness of the comet has raised questions about its composition and behaviour. Researchers have employed a technique called "shift-stacking" to accurately track the comet's trajectory, as it moves faster than the stars typically monitored by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The findings suggest that comets from other solar systems may contain different materials compared to those from our own solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by TESS in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>It has been visible since May 2023 on other telescopes.</li>
    <li>The comet's brightness has increased due to the emission of "hypervolatile" materials.</li>
    <li>Researchers used a technique called "shift-stacking" to determine its trajectory.</li>
    <li>In October 2022, a super rare comet appeared for the first time in 80,000 years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2023, 3I/ATLAS became visible on various telescopes. By early July, researchers using TESS detected the comet and began tracking its unusual activity. The use of "shift-stacking" allowed them to pinpoint its trajectory more accurately. As observations continued, the comet's brightness increased, leading to further analysis of its composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unusual brightness of 3I/ATLAS has led researchers to conclude that it is emitting hypervolatile materials, which is a different characteristic compared to typical comets in our solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The appearance of 3I/ATLAS follows the notable sighting of Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS in October 2022, which was called the ‘comet of the century’ due to its brightness and visibility. This comet was observed for the first time in 80,000 years, raising interest in the study of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth to gather more data on its composition and behaviour. Further observations are expected in the coming months as the comet's trajectory becomes clearer.</p>
