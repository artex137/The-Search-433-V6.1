      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Set for Close Approach to Earth on December 19</h2>

<p>Astronomers are observing interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with a closest flyby scheduled for December 19, 2025. As of December 14, 2025, the comet was approximately 270.5 million kilometres away. Scientists have confirmed that this encounter poses no risk to Earth.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the unusual features observed on 3I/ATLAS, which challenge existing theories about comet behaviour beyond the solar system. Researchers are currently analysing the comet's unique structure, particularly its mysterious anti-tail, which is rarely seen in comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: approximately 268.9 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Latest image captured: December 13, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Rayong, eastern Thailand</li>
    <li>Telescope used: 0.26 metre telescope</li>
    <li>Time delay for images: approximately 15 minutes</li>
    <li>Notable feature: unusual anti-tail</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was observed approaching the Sun. By November 2025, it was moving away from the Sun, yet the anti-tail feature remained visible. The latest data indicates that thousands of observations have confirmed the persistent presence of this feature.</p>
<p>A NASA briefing on November 19, 2025, did not address the mystery of the anti-tail, but since then, new theories have emerged. Recent peer-reviewed studies co-authored by Eric Keto have suggested that sunlight scattering off icy fragments may be responsible for the anti-tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of the anti-tail contradicts what we expect from typical comet behaviour,” said astronomer Teerasak Thaluang. “This observation prompts new questions about the physical processes at play.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Anti-tails are unusual phenomena that occur when material is directed toward the Sun rather than away from it, as typically seen in comets. The current observations of 3I/ATLAS are particularly crucial as the object is expected to exit the inner solar system soon.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further analysis using Hubble Space Telescope data to clarify the origins of the anti-tail. Results from this analysis could provide insights into the unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS and contribute to the understanding of comet dynamics.</p>
