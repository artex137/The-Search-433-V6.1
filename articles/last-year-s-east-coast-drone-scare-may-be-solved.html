      <h2>Last Year’s East Coast Drone Scare May Be Solved</h2>

<p>A private company has claimed responsibility for a series of drone and “UFO” sightings that alarmed New Jersey residents last year. The announcement was made during the Army’s UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August 2025, according to a report in The New York Post. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to these incidents.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it may clarify the source of widespread concerns regarding unidentified flying objects in the region. Authorities have previously stated that many sightings involved civilian operators rather than military or extraterrestrial crafts. The company has asserted that its aircraft was testing systems under a private government contract, which did not require public notification.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Army UAS and Launched Effects Summit</li>
    <li>Date: August 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Fort Rucker, Alabama</li>
    <li>Aircraft: Approximately 20-foot, four-winged craft</li>
    <li>Test flights: Conducted over New Jersey in November 2024</li>
    <li>Demonstration duration: About 30 minutes</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Homeland Security, FBI</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Reports of mysterious aerial activity in New Jersey began on November 13, 2024, near Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County. These sightings continued into early December 2024. In response to public concern, the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI jointly indicated that the majority of incidents were likely caused by hobbyists or recreational pilots.</p>
<p>In August 2025, the private company at the Army summit revealed that its aircraft, which had been tested in New Jersey, could easily be mistaken for a UFO due to its unconventional design and flight patterns.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” said a company employee during the demonstration.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It feels like it’s a UFO because it defies what you’re expecting to see,” said a military veteran who attended the event, describing the aircraft's movements.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader trend of reported UFO sightings across the United States, with many being attributed to drones or other civilian aircraft. In December 2024, authorities clarified that the majority of sightings were not linked to military operations or extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the drone sightings in New Jersey may continue as authorities aim to verify claims made by the private company. There are no current charges or deadlines disclosed regarding ongoing inquiries.</p>
