      <h2>Sailor linked to Area 51 shares chilling details of four UFOs rising from ocean</h2>

<p>A U.S. Navy officer has reported a confrontation with four unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that emerged from the Pacific Ocean on February 15, 2023. Senior Chief Operations Specialist Alexandro Wiggins, a Navy veteran with 23 years of service, was aboard the USS Jackson off the southern California coastline when the incident occurred. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it adds to the ongoing discourse around UFOs and military encounters, particularly in the area known as Warning Area 291, which has a history of such reports. Authorities and analysts are examining the details of the incident, including flight data from the time of the sighting.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: February 15, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Southern California coastline, Pacific Ocean</li>
    <li>Witness: Senior Chief Operations Specialist Alexandro Wiggins</li>
    <li>Ship: USS Jackson</li>
    <li>Objects observed: Four tic-tac-shaped UFOs</li>
    <li>Area: Warning Area 291, a military-controlled zone</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 15, 2023, Senior Chief Operations Specialist Alexandro Wiggins was aboard the USS Jackson when he detected unusual objects on his monitors. Wiggins went outside for a clearer view and observed a light surfacing from the ocean. He returned to the combat center to analyze the phenomenon with a thermal sensor, which revealed two tic-tac-shaped objects. Upon zooming out, Wiggins identified a total of four objects moving in a synchronized pattern northeast.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To my surprise, which is something I've never witnessed, was a light I noticed on the horizon, it looked as if it were surfacing out of the water and going up,” Wiggins said. “It was only when we zoom out that we realize, holy crap, there's two more out here, a total of four.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader pattern of UFO sightings in military-controlled areas. Warning Area 291 has been linked to several reports of unidentified craft, including a notable sighting in 2004 involving Navy pilots and tic-tac-shaped UFOs. Previous investigations have been conducted by classified government programs, seeking to understand the nature of these encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigators are currently examining flight data from the time of the sighting to determine if any U.S. aircraft were present in the vicinity. Wiggins has expressed skepticism about the nature of what he observed, noting that the truth may not be revealed for many years.</p>
