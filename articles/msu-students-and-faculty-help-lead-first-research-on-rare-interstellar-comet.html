      <h2>MSU students and faculty help lead first research on rare interstellar comet</h2>

<p>A team of students and faculty at Michigan State University (MSU) has published the first scientific paper on the newly discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was detected on July 1, 2025. The MSU Observatory in East Lansing has played a pivotal role in this research, which involves collaboration among over 40 contributors, including graduate students Atsuhiro Yaginuma and Tessa Frincke.</p>

<p>This research is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object, and its unique characteristics can offer insights into the formation of celestial bodies outside our solar system. According to Assistant Professor Darryl Seligman, the discovery has prompted urgent collaborative efforts among scientists at NASA and in Europe to study the comet's trajectory and activity before it becomes difficult to observe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach perihelion in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of 58 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Over 40 collaborators contributed to the first scientific paper on 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Yaginuma and Frincke have submitted their own papers on the comet, pending review.</li>
    <li>NASA is working to use space-based assets to monitor 3I/ATLAS during its perihelion phase.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey detected the interstellar object, prompting immediate investigation by a team of scientists. Assistant Professor Darryl Seligman and his colleagues confirmed the object's hyperbolic trajectory within hours, indicating it was indeed interstellar. The team quickly began assembling their research paper, with contributions from students and faculty alike.</p>

<p>As the summer progressed, graduate students Yaginuma and Frincke shifted their research focus entirely to 3I/ATLAS. Frincke began remote observations from East Lansing using the Southern Astrophysical Research telescope in Chile, analyzing the object's brightness and light curve. The urgency of the research increased as the comet's perihelion approached, with plans to utilize NASA's space-based assets for continued monitoring.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For me as an undergrad, the first discovery paper is basically one that gets a lot of citations,” said Yaginuma. “Being part of that community means I can keep working with them in the future.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This thing comes through and never comes back,” Seligman said. “You want as many observations as possible. At perihelion it’ll be most active, but we can’t see it from Earth then, so that's very frustrating.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its speed and unique characteristics, which differ significantly from the first two known interstellar objects. The comet's rapid movement and the presence of a tail due to sublimation of water ice and CO₂ have captured the interest of astronomers. As the scientific community continues to study interstellar objects, 3I/ATLAS represents a rare opportunity for research and discovery.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, researchers plan to maximize observations before it becomes obscured by the Sun. NASA is coordinating efforts to utilize its fleet of orbiting spacecraft to gather data during this critical phase, ensuring that scientists can continue to study this rare interstellar phenomenon.</p>
