      <h2>3I/ATLAS Flies To Jupiter: Plasma Physicist Claims Earth Is 'Chasing Away' Comet From Sun</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, is moving towards a close flyby of Jupiter, expected on 16 March 2026. The comet has gained attention after plasma physicist Dr. John Brandenburg claimed on social media that Earth is 'chasing away' the comet from the Sun, sparking debate among scientists and the public.</p>

<p>This discussion has prompted scrutiny of the physical principles governing comet trajectories. Authorities and scientists continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, with various theories emerging about its nature and path.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass about 53 million miles (85 million km) from Jupiter.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Jupiter is set for 16 March 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently travelling in the outer regions of the solar system.</li>
    <li>Dr. John Brandenburg is the head of Kepler's Astronautics Division.</li>
    <li>Brandenburg holds degrees in physics and theoretical plasma physics from UC Davis.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a reported pulse rate of 16.16 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been a subject of interest since its discovery. As it moves through the solar system, Dr. John Brandenburg has made claims regarding its trajectory, suggesting that Earth's position is influencing its path. This assertion has led to a mix of skepticism and intrigue among observers.</p>

<p>As the flyby date approaches, discussions and debates about the nature of 3I/ATLAS have intensified, with both scientific and public interest growing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a fact for which we should all be grateful. I much prefer an 'Academic' debate over the real nature of 3I than have it do something threatening.”</blockquote>
<p>- Dr. John Brandenburg</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies indicate that Earth does not have the capability to push or chase away comets effectively. Comets are primarily influenced by the Sun's gravity and other forces, such as outgassing jets. Earth can only impact a comet's trajectory if it passes very close, which is not the case for 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>NASA's DART mission has demonstrated that deliberate impacts can alter an asteroid's path, but such methods do not apply to 3I/ATLAS, which moves too quickly for Earth to influence its trajectory meaningfully.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. The ongoing debate surrounding its nature and trajectory is expected to evolve as new observations are made closer to the flyby date.</p>
