      <h2>A Message in a Bottle from Another Star</h2>

<p>A team from Auburn University has detected water from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, marking a significant finding in the study of celestial bodies. This discovery was made using NASA's Swift Observatory, which captured the comet's emissions nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth. The observations occurred recently, although the exact date was not disclosed.</p>

<p>This finding is important because it allows scientists to compare 3I/ATLAS with comets from our Solar System. The presence of water in an interstellar comet has never been documented before, according to the research team. This breakthrough offers insights into the chemistry of planetary systems across the galaxy and raises questions about the formation of such comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth.</li>
    <li>Water loss from the comet is estimated at approximately 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The observations were made using NASA's Swift Observatory, which detects ultraviolet wavelengths.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be observable again after mid-November 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar comet. Observations by Auburn University's team have captured hydroxyl emissions, indicating water presence. The specific date of these observations is not disclosed, but they occurred recently.</p>

<p>The Swift Observatory's unique capabilities allowed the team to detect emissions free from atmospheric interference, enhancing the sensitivity of their measurements. Data collection was completed before the comet became less visible, with plans for further observations once it reappears in mid-November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Finding the same chemical signature in an interstellar visitor means astronomers can finally begin comparing 3I/ATLAS directly with Solar System comets,” the research team stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, with 2I/Borisov being the first confirmed example observed in 2019. 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar visitors, each revealing different chemical compositions. Previous comets like 'Oumuamua in 2017 were found to be dry, while 2I/Borisov contained significant carbon monoxide.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research team plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS when it becomes observable again in mid-November. They aim to track its activity as it approaches the Sun, which may provide additional data on its composition and behavior.</p>
