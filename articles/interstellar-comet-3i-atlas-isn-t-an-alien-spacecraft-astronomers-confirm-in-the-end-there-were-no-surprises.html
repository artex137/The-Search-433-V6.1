      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS isn't an alien spacecraft, astronomers confirm</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that Comet 3I/ATLAS is not an alien spacecraft after conducting extensive research using the Green Bank Telescope. The findings were announced recently, closing the door on speculation regarding the comet's origin and nature.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it addresses public interest in extraterrestrial life and the potential for interstellar objects to be probes sent by advanced civilizations. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, led the study as part of the Breakthrough Listen project, which aims to detect technosignatures from extraterrestrial civilizations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known object from interstellar space, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The research was conducted using the Green Bank Telescope, a 100-meter-wide radio dish.</li>
    <li>Scientists reported no detectable technosignatures, even at levels as low as 0.1 watts.</li>
    <li>Researchers identified nine signals during their search, all of which were attributed to Earth-based sources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, 1I/'Oumuamua was the first interstellar object identified in the solar system. This was followed by the detection of 2I/Borisov in 2019. Comet 3I/ATLAS was subsequently discovered, prompting interest in its potential as an extraterrestrial probe.</p>
<p>Researchers initiated their investigation of 3I/ATLAS using the Green Bank Telescope, focusing on detecting narrowband radio signals that could indicate technology. The findings were released recently, confirming that the comet does not exhibit signs of artificial signals.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We all would have been thrilled to find technosignatures coming from 3I/ATLAS, but they're just not there,” said lead researcher Benjamin Jacobson-Bell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Finding no signals was the result we expected, due to the significant evidence for 3I/ATLAS being a comet with only natural features,” Jacobson-Bell added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“In the end, there were no surprises,” Jacobson-Bell concluded.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This research comes in the wake of growing public interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. The Breakthrough Listen project aims to explore the universe for signs of technology, using advanced telescopes like the Green Bank Telescope to minimize interference from Earth-based signals.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar discoveries have sparked debates about the possibility of advanced civilizations sending probes to study our solar system. The study of 3I/ATLAS serves as a benchmark for future investigations into interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>While the search for technosignatures from 3I/ATLAS has concluded, researchers plan to continue exploring other interstellar objects. Future projects, including the Legacy Survey of Space and Time by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, aim to increase the discovery rate of such objects, potentially revealing more about their origins and characteristics.</p>
