      <h2>The New Comet SWAN (C/2025 R2) Originated from a Different Direction Than 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On September 11, 2025, the SWAN instrument aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft detected a new comet, officially named C/2025 R2 (SWAN), which has a long tail stretching across 2 degrees in the sky. The comet's trajectory indicates that it originated from the direction of the Sun relative to Earth, which has contributed to its late discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it helps in understanding the origins and paths of comets within our solar system. The discovery opens new avenues for research into the characteristics of comets and their potential interactions with Earth. Astronomers have been monitoring the comet closely due to its unique orbital pattern and its upcoming close approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was detected on September 11, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's perihelion occurred on September 12, 2025, at a distance of 75 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Earth will cross the comet's orbit on October 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of SWAN to Earth will be at a distance of 39 million kilometers on October 20, 2025.</li>
    <li>The orbital period of SWAN around the Sun is 286 years.</li>
    <li>SWAN's aphelion is 86 AU within the outer Kuiper belt.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between August 8 and September 13, 2025, comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) remained within 30 degrees of the Sun, making it difficult for telescopes to observe. The comet was officially identified on September 11, 2025, and its perihelion occurred the following day. The close approaches to Earth are set for early October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The arrival directions of the two objects are very different: SWAN originated from the direction of the Aquarius constellation, whereas 3I/ATLAS arrived from the Sagittarius constellation.”</blockquote> 

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of comets have indicated that their paths can provide insights into the early solar system. The differences in the origins of comets like SWAN and 3I/ATLAS suggest varied histories and compositions, which are important for understanding the dynamics of our cosmic neighborhood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) as it approaches Earth, particularly for any potential meteor showers resulting from its orbit. Further observations are planned to gather more data on its composition and trajectory.</p>
