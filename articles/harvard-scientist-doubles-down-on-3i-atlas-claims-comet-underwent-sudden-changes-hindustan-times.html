      <h2>Harvard scientist doubles down on 3I/ATLAS claims; comet underwent ‘sudden changes'</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has reiterated his observations regarding the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> during an interview on Thursday, stating that the comet has exhibited unexpected behaviours, including a sudden brightening and a shift to a bluer hue. Loeb made these comments while speaking to Newsmax, where he expressed concerns about the lack of transparency in NASA's data release.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its classification as a cometary object. Loeb has called for more openness from NASA regarding the details of the comet’s behaviour, particularly after it passed close to Mars earlier this month.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li><strong>Scientist:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
  <li><strong>Date of interview:</strong> Thursday, not disclosed</li>
  <li><strong>Media outlet:</strong> Newsmax</li>
  <li><strong>Notable behaviours:</strong> Sudden brightening, shift to a bluer hue</li>
  <li><strong>Proximity to Mars:</strong> Passed unusually close earlier this month</li>
  <li><strong>NASA's stance:</strong> 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has observed that 3I/ATLAS has brightened more quickly than any previously recorded comet as it approached the Sun’s perihelion. He noted that this rapid brightening is unprecedented. Additionally, he remarked on the object’s unusual blue colour, which diverges from the typical reddish hue of comets.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, 3I/ATLAS passed close to Mars, although photographs from this event have not yet been released by NASA. Loeb has expressed a desire for more data to be shared regarding the comet's behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “We have a report that the object got much brighter than expected, much brighter than any previous comet from the solar system did as it approached the Sun’s perihelion.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further explained, “The colour of the object is blue, bluer than the Sun. And that’s very surprising, because usually when there is dust around an object, it should make it red.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA has maintained that 3I/ATLAS “poses no threat to Earth” and supports its classification as a cometary object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has generated discussion among astronomers, with some independent experts arguing that its actions, while atypical, still fall within the range of extreme natural phenomena. Loeb has suggested that the combination of rapid brightening and the unusual colour may indicate more than a standard cometary event, although he acknowledges that a natural explanation remains plausible.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the behaviour of 3I/ATLAS are expected, with a focus on data release from NASA. The scientific community continues to monitor the object as it travels through the Solar System.</p>
