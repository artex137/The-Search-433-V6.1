      <h2>Navy chief who witnessed multiple UFO sightings in one evening reveals what actually happened that night</h2>

<p>US Navy Senior Chief Operations Specialist Alexandro Wiggins has reported witnessing multiple unidentified flying objects (UFOs) while onboard the USS Jackson off the coast of California on 15 February 2023. Wiggins observed four Tic Tac-shaped objects during his duties as a radar specialist, which he claims emerged from the Pacific Ocean and flew away without leaving any exhaust trails.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it adds to ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the need for transparency regarding such incidents. Wiggins has shared his experience during a Congressional hearing, contributing to the growing body of evidence regarding UFO sightings by military personnel.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 15 February 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Off the coast of California, onboard USS Jackson</li>
    <li><strong>Objects observed:</strong> Four Tic Tac-shaped UFOs</li>
    <li><strong>Witness role:</strong> Senior Chief Operations Specialist, radar specialist</li>
    <li><strong>Reported to:</strong> Tactical officer onboard USS Jackson</li>
    <li><strong>Hearing date:</strong> 9 September 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 15 February 2023, while working on the USS Jackson, Wiggins detected an object on radar that he later confirmed visually. He reported seeing a light on the horizon surfacing from the water and rising into the air. Wiggins initially observed one object but later identified three more, leading to a total of four UFOs.</p>

<p>Wiggins utilized the SAFIRE System, a thermal sensor, to analyze the sightings further. He compared the unidentified objects to a passing commercial aircraft, which displayed clear air signatures, confirming the unusual nature of the UFOs he witnessed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“From my observations, it did in fact come from the water. It was first seen on radar and once I saw it on radar, I wanted to confirm visually what I was seeing on radar.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It [was] rising into the air high enough to where I’m like, alright, that’s definitely: A. too fast and B. not something I’ve seen before.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“You see the shape of the nose of the aircraft. You see it perfectly. It was kind of like ‘Checkmate’, and he sat back down.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The USS Jackson incident is part of a broader trend of increased military encounters with UFOs. Such sightings have prompted investigations and Congressional hearings to better understand these phenomena. The push for transparency has grown as military personnel, like Wiggins, come forward with their experiences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into UAP sightings are expected as authorities continue to collect data and testimonies from military personnel. Wiggins' account contributes to the ongoing dialogue about the nature of these unidentified objects and the military's response to them.</p>
