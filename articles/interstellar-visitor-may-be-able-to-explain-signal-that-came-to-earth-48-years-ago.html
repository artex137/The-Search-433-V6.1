      <h2>Interstellar visitor may explain 1977 signal</h2>

<p>A radio signal detected in 1977 from space may have originated from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, according to Harvard astronomer Dr. Avi Loeb. The signal, known as the "Wow! Signal," was recorded by Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope and has not been observed again in the 48 years since its detection.</p>

<p>This new theory could provide insight into the unexplained signal that has puzzled scientists for decades. Dr. Loeb has proposed that 3I/ATLAS, which was first observed on July 1, 2025, could be linked to the Wow! Signal, potentially indicating intelligent life beyond Earth. Further research and observation are necessary to confirm this connection.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Wow! Signal lasted 72 seconds and was detected on August 15, 1977.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be 20 kilometres wide and is traveling at approximately 60 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA categorizes 3I/ATLAS as a comet.</li>
    <li>The comet will be no closer than 240 million kilometres to Earth.</li>
    <li>Dr. Loeb suggests the Wow! Signal may have originated from 3I/ATLAS when it was 600 astronomical units away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 15, 1977, the Big Ear radio telescope detected a 72-second radio burst, later dubbed the Wow! Signal. This signal sparked interest in the scientific community as a possible indication of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>More than four decades later, on July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, identified the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Dr. Avi Loeb has since speculated that this comet may be the source of the Wow! Signal.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If the Wow! Signal originated from 3I/ATLAS, how powerful was the transmitter?” – Dr. Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<blockquote>“By the time the comet reaches its closest point to Earth, it will be hidden behind the Sun.” – NASA</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Wow! Signal has generated numerous theories since its detection. In 2017, a teacher suggested the signal came from a hydrogen cloud surrounding two comets, but this theory was dismissed as the clouds were not visible to the telescope. In 2020, amateur astronomer Alberto Caballero proposed that the signal might have originated from a sun-like star, 2MASS 19281982-2640123, based on its similar characteristics to our Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Dr. Loeb urges further observation of 3I/ATLAS using radio telescopes to determine if the comet exhibits any radio transmissions. The comet is expected to reappear by early December, providing astronomers an opportunity for additional study.</p>
