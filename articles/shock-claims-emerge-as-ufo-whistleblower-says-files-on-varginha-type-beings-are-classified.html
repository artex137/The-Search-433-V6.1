      <h2>Shock Claims Emerge as UFO Whistleblower Says Files on 'Varginha-Type Beings' Are Classified</h2>

<p>Respected scientist Jacques Vallée has claimed that classified scientific and medical files describe non-human beings similar to those reported in Brazil's Varginha case. Vallée made these statements during a recent discussion, asserting that the records exist within official systems and could alter global understanding of unidentified phenomena if classification rules are relaxed.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as Vallée is a prominent figure in the study of unidentified phenomena. He has called for action to ease classification restrictions, arguing that secrecy has hindered serious research. Vallée's comments have sparked discussion about the transparency of scientific data related to UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Jacques Vallée</strong> is a French-American computer scientist and astronomer.</li>
    <li>He holds a PhD in computer science from the <strong>University of Paris</strong>.</li>
    <li>Vallée asserts that files document <strong>seven entities</strong> similar to those seen in the <strong>1996 Varginha incident</strong>.</li>
    <li>He claims these beings breathe air normally, a detail he considers medically significant.</li>
    <li>Vallée has urged for easing of classification requirements to facilitate scientific examination of the data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Jacques Vallée has been researching unidentified phenomena for several decades. He has published over a dozen influential books that link mainstream science with unexplained aerial encounters. Recently, he revealed insights regarding classified files that could reshape understanding of UFOs.</p>
<p>The 1996 Varginha incident involved multiple witnesses reporting sightings of small, humanoid creatures following a crash in Brazil. Vallée's current claims highlight that formal records exist, which could provide more comprehensive insights into such encounters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The greatest barrier to understanding these phenomena is secrecy rather than lack of evidence,” Vallée said. “Easing restrictions would allow the scientific community to examine data at a much higher level.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Vallée has long criticized the compartmentalization of information regarding unidentified phenomena, arguing that it has impeded research. His recent statements mark a moment of increased visibility for the UFO discourse, particularly concerning the existence of non-human entities.</p>
<p>Previous incidents, such as the Varginha case, have sparked controversy and debate regarding the nature of such beings and the extent of government knowledge on the subject.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Vallée’s claims may lead to renewed discussions about the need for transparency in scientific research related to UFOs. Investigations into the classified files he referenced could also prompt further examination by the scientific community and government agencies.</p>
