      <h2>Manhattan-sized interstellar object 3I/ATLAS accelerates and turns bluer — possible signs of alien 'engine': Harvard scientist</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, measuring approximately the size of Manhattan, has displayed signs of non-gravitational acceleration and a bluer appearance as it passed near the Sun this week, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. Observations recorded by NASA indicate that the object is undergoing dramatic outgassing, which could suggest it is a comet that may lose half its mass and produce a significant debris plume in the upcoming months.</p>

<p>This development raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, with Loeb proposing in a recent paper that the acceleration and changing color could indicate an artificially constructed craft. The findings have prompted scientists and space agencies to closely monitor the object as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately the size of Manhattan</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, at about 267 million km (167 million miles)</li>
    <li>Current distance from the Sun: 172 million miles</li>
    <li>Observation methods: Measurements taken by crafts orbiting the Sun</li>
    <li>Initial appearance: Red, then green, now appears distinctly bluer than the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed as it approached the Sun, displaying a red hue. As it neared, observations indicated a shift to green before it turned distinctly bluer. NASA recorded signs of non-gravitational acceleration this week, suggesting a significant outgassing event.</p>
<p>The object is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, which will provide scientists with their best opportunity to study it further.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Alternatively, the non-gravitational acceleration might be the technological signature of an internal engine,” Loeb wrote in a Medium post. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said NASA’s Acting Administrator Sean Duffy on X.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time an interstellar object has been observed in our solar system. Previous encounters have sparked interest in the potential for extraterrestrial technology, but none have provided conclusive evidence. The scientific community remains divided on interpretations of such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Researchers plan to analyze data collected during its closest pass to determine whether it is a comet or an artificial craft. Further observations are expected to clarify the object's characteristics and behavior.</p>
