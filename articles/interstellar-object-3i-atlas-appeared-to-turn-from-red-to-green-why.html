      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Appears to Change Color</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet first observed in July 2025, has shown a notable color change from red to green, as reported by astronomers earlier this month. The comet, currently traversing the Solar System, has sparked interest among scientists due to its unusual properties.</p>

<p>This change in coloration is significant for researchers studying the composition of comets and their behavior. Authorities, including NASA, have clarified that 3I/ATLAS is not an alien spacecraft, but an active comet with a solid icy nucleus and a surrounding gas and ice coma.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First observed: July 2025</li>
    <li>Color change noted: September 7, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observations: Namibia during a lunar eclipse</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: over 33 billion tons (33 trillion kilograms)</li>
    <li>Nucleus diameter: 5 kilometers (3.1 miles)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in early July 2025. Initial observations indicated a reddish hue. On September 7, 2025, amateur astrophotographers Michael Jäger and Gerald Rhemann captured images of the comet during a lunar eclipse in Namibia, revealing a green coloration.</p>
<p>On August 25, 2025, observations by the European Southern Observatory noted a rise in cyanide production in the comet's coma, which could be linked to its color change.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our images show a gas-rich coma of 2 arcminutes for the first time. It was clearly visible in both the blue and green filters,” said Michael Jäger, describing the observations made during the lunar eclipse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor, suggested that the color change may be “associated with the steep rise in the production of cyanide,” based on observations made by the Very Large Telescope.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object directly observed in our Solar System, following ʻOumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. Its size and composition have attracted significant attention from the scientific community, particularly due to its carbon-chain depletion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are necessary to understand its color-changing phenomena. However, the comet will become less visible as it moves behind the Sun from late October 2025, with expectations of renewed observations in early December 2025.</p>
