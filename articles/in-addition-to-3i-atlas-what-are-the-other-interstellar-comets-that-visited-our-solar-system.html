      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS is third known interstellar object to visit solar system</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been confirmed as the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following the previous visits of 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet is currently approaching the Sun and will reach its closest point on October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances the understanding of celestial objects originating from outside our solar system. NASA has activated its planetary defense protocol in response to the comet's approach, noting that it poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Comet's diameter estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Current speed is approximately 221,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun is on October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Will pass near Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by ATLAS on an undisclosed date. It has since been tracked as it approaches the Sun.</p>
<p>On October 3, 2025, 3I/ATLAS passed near Mars, approximately 30 million kilometers away. It will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, and will be hidden behind the Sun during its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>
<p>Following its perihelion, the comet will continue its journey into interstellar space, with a planned pass in front of Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA has activated its planetary defense protocol against the comet,” officials stated, confirming that the object does not pose a danger to Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Before 3I/ATLAS, 1I/’Oumuamua was discovered on October 19, 2017, and classified initially as both a comet and an asteroid. It was later confirmed as a comet due to its non-gravitational acceleration. 2I/Borisov was discovered by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov on August 30, 2019, and confirmed as the first interstellar comet.</p>
<p>Both previous objects have contributed to the understanding of interstellar materials and their characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and activity. Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope are expected to provide further insights into the comet's composition and behavior.</p>
