      <h2>Harvard scientist claims tail 'grown' by 'potentially hostile threat' could be alien activity</h2>

<p>A Harvard scientist monitoring the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has suggested that the space rock may exhibit signs of being an alien object. Avi Loeb, along with fellow researchers Adam Hibberd and Adam Crowl, co-authored a paper discussing the comet's potential as a "technological artefact." This insight has raised concerns about possible "benign" or "malign" intentions from the comet, which has captured the attention of the scientific community since its identification earlier this year.</p>

<p>The implications of this theory have prompted researchers to consider defensive measures. While the prevailing belief is that 3I/ATLAS is merely a comet passing through our solar system, its addition to the International Asteroid Warning Network's list of threats has intensified interest in its trajectory and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the size of New York.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb co-authored a paper with Adam Hibberd and Adam Crowl discussing its potential as a technological artefact.</li>
    <li>The comet has exhibited both a tail and an anti-tail.</li>
    <li>Images from NASA’s HiRISE camera are expected to provide clearer views of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was identified earlier this year, drawing significant interest from scientists. Following its detection, the comet exhibited a tail, which appeared shortly after an anti-tail was observed. This phenomenon has prompted discussions around its nature and origins.</p>
<p>Loeb's paper, which speculates about the comet's potential as an alien spacecraft, has sparked both intrigue and caution within the scientific community. The researchers are currently awaiting images from NASA, which will enhance understanding of the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The hypothesis in question is that [3I/ATLAS] is a technological artefact, and furthermore has active intelligence. If this is the case, then two possibilities follow: first that its intentions are entirely benign and second they are malign,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This speculation follows a trend of heightened interest in unidentified celestial objects, particularly those that display unusual characteristics. The scientific community has seen various discussions around the possibility of extraterrestrial technology, especially as new discoveries emerge.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will analyze the forthcoming images from NASA’s HiRISE camera to further investigate the comet’s features and trajectory. The findings may influence ongoing discussions regarding potential threats posed by celestial objects.</p>
