      <h2>Hubble Captures Rare Dual-Tail Structure on Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS as It Nears Dec. 19 Flyby</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which features a rare dual-tail structure, using the Hubble Space Telescope. The images were taken on November 30, 2025, as the comet approached Earth from a distance of 286 million kilometres ahead of its closest flyby on December 19.</p>

<p>The findings are significant as they reveal the comet's unusual characteristics, which distinguish it from typical solar system comets. Both the European Space Agency and NASA are involved in analyzing these images to better understand the comet's chemical signatures and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently 286 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
    <li>Hubble's images were captured on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency are collaborating on this research.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 30, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet has been observed exhibiting a dual-tail structure and unique chemical signatures. The closest approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2025, prompting increased interest from astronomers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Astronomers are racing to analyse new Hubble Space Telescope images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, an object with a highly unusual dual-tail structure and exotic chemical signatures that set it apart from comets born in the solar system.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its distinct features compared to other comets. Previous studies of interstellar comets have provided insights into the origins of such objects and their composition, enhancing our understanding of the solar system's formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency will continue to analyze the images and data collected from Hubble as the comet approaches Earth, with further findings expected following the flyby on December 19.</p>
