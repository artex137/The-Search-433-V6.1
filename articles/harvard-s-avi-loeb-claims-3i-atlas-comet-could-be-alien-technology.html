      <h2>Harvard’s Avi Loeb Claims 3I/ATLAS Comet Could Be Alien Technology</h2>

<p>Professor Avi Loeb, a Harvard University astrophysicist, has suggested that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS might be an artificial probe, challenging the prevailing belief that it is a natural comet. His claims, made in 2023, have sparked significant debate among astronomers worldwide.</p>

<p>Loeb's theory follows his previous work on the object ‘Oumuamua, which he also proposed could be alien technology. This new assertion places 3I/ATLAS under heightened scrutiny from the scientific community. According to Reuters, reactions have been mixed, with many astronomers urging caution and calling for further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered by: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in 2023</li>
    <li>Loeb's position: Professor of astrophysics at Harvard University</li>
    <li>Key features noted: Unusual “anti-tail” of dust and gas, nickel emissions without iron</li>
    <li>Nasa's response: Denies withholding data, emphasizes commitment to open-access archives</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2023 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Following its discovery, Professor Avi Loeb presented his hypothesis that the comet may not be a natural object but could instead be an artificial probe. His claims have led to a renewed focus on the object's unique characteristics, particularly its anti-tail and unusual chemical composition.</p>

<p>Loeb has called for transparency from space agencies regarding data on 3I/ATLAS, asserting that the current information available may be incomplete. NASA has responded by stating that all data from major observatories is shared publicly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The scientific community is deeply divided on the issue,” said Loeb, emphasizing the need for further study of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nasa has stated, “All data from major observatories is shared through open-access archives,” countering claims of data withholding.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's previous work on ‘Oumuamua has similarly stirred controversy, as he suggested that it could also represent alien technology. The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflects ongoing discussions in the scientific community regarding the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and the interpretation of unusual astronomical phenomena.</p>

<p>Many scientists advocate for caution, arguing that more conventional explanations for the anomalies observed in 3I/ATLAS should be explored before considering extraordinary claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The debate over 3I/ATLAS is expected to continue as scientists conduct further investigations into its characteristics. The search for definitive answers about this potential alien technology is now fully underway, with ongoing scrutiny from both the public and the scientific community.</p>
