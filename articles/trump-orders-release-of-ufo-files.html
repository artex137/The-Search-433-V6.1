      <h2>Trump orders release of UFO files</h2>

<p>Former President Donald Trump has ordered the release of previously classified files related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs), according to a statement from his office on Tuesday. The release is part of his administration's ongoing efforts to promote transparency regarding government investigations into UFO sightings.</p>

<p>This decision is significant as it reflects a growing interest in UFO phenomena and the implications for national security. Authorities are expected to review the documents for any sensitive information before they are made public, as per standard protocol for classified materials.</p>
