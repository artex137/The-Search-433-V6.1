      <h2>NASA Expands Monitoring of Interstellar Comet After Detecting Unusual Radio Signals in Space</h2>

<p>The global scientific community has focused on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS after it was confirmed passing through our solar system. This celestial body has shown extraordinary speed, exceeding <strong>100,000 kilometers per second</strong>, indicating its hyperbolic trajectory and interstellar origin. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it marks the third interstellar object cataloged by humanity, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. NASA and ESA have activated advanced tracking protocols to monitor 3I/ATLAS, which has begun emitting unusual electromagnetic signals. Astronomers aim to understand the source of these signals, which may provide insights into the internal physics of objects from other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Exceeding 100,000 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Closest distance:</strong> More than 27 million kilometers from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Frequency of radio emissions:</strong> 1.6 GHz</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> NASA, ESA, MeerKAT</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar objects:</strong> ‘Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been confirmed passing through the solar system, prompting the global scientific community to focus on its trajectory and behavior. The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected radio emissions from the object, which has raised questions about its internal processes. Notably, astronomers are investigating whether these emissions result from natural sublimation or complex magnetic interactions.</p>

<p>As the situation unfolds, observatories such as the Very Large Telescope in Chile and the Hubble Space Telescope are repurposed for detailed spectroscopy. Their goal is to map the presence of volatile compounds in 3I/ATLAS and compare its chemical signature with those of previous interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The confirmation of 3I/ATLAS marks a historic moment for astronomy,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “It provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to study the formation of planetary systems beyond our own.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS follows the detection of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, both of which have contributed to understanding the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. The study of these objects has become increasingly important in planetary science, as they offer insights into the origins of other solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the solar system. Researchers will analyze the collected data to refine their understanding of the object’s properties and its implications for future interstellar studies.</p>
