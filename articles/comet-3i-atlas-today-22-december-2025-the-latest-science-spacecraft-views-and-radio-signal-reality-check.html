      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>On 22 December 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is heading away from Earth after its closest approach on 19 December 2025. The comet passed at a distance of approximately 1.7–1.8 AU, or 167–170 million miles (269–270 million km), which is nearly twice the distance between Earth and the Sun. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<h2>Importance of the Event</h2>
<p>This event is significant as it presents a rare scientific opportunity for researchers to gather data from a comet originating from outside our solar system. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are currently analyzing data collected from various spacecraft and telescopes that observed 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 1.7–1.8 AU (167–170 million miles / 269–270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Observations:</strong> Conducted by Green Bank Telescope, MeerKAT, Allen Telescope Array, ESA’s JUICE, and others</li>
    <li><strong>X-ray observations:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is the first interstellar comet imaged in X-ray light</li>
    <li><strong>Next milestones:</strong> Full data return from JUICE on 18 and 20 February 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Future proximity:</strong> Expected to pass near Jupiter in March 2026 at about 33 million miles (53 million km)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has followed a notable path leading up to its closest approach:</p>
<ul>
    <li>18 December 2025: Green Bank Telescope observed the comet, detecting no artificial emissions.</li>
    <li>19 December 2025: Closest approach to Earth.</li>
    <li>6 November 2025: NASA’s Europa Clipper observed the comet from a distance of 164 million km.</li>
    <li>23-28 November 2025: JAXA’s XRISM performed observations with an effective exposure of 17 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official Statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No artificial radio emission localized to 3I/ATLAS was detected,” the Breakthrough Listen program stated in a report.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What we see is normal chemistry and no evidence of artificial transmissions,” a spokesperson for the MeerKAT facility said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The observations have provided a diagnostic of how an interstellar comet’s material behaves when influenced by our Sun,” said an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates that it is moving too quickly to be gravitationally captured by the Sun. The comet's approach has prompted widespread media coverage and public interest, particularly regarding the potential for extraterrestrial signals.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the close approach, researchers will continue to analyze data collected from various observatories. The next significant data releases from ESA's JUICE mission are scheduled for 18 and 20 February 2026, which are expected to enhance understanding of the comet's composition and activity.</p>
