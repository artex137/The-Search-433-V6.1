<p>A skywatcher in Lakewood, Colorado, has reported seeing a metallic disc in the sky on December 8, 2023. The object, described as circular and gray with a silver shine, hovered silently and exhibited unusual movement patterns, according to the National UFO Reporting Center.</p>

<p>This sighting is part of a series of recent UFO reports in Colorado, prompting increased attention from both the public and authorities. The National UFO Reporting Center is cataloguing these incidents, which have drawn interest due to their unexplained nature and potential implications for aviation safety and public curiosity.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 8, 2023, a skywatcher in Lakewood observed a disc-shaped object that hovered silently before moving in a gliding motion. The witness described the object as moving quickly upward after about a minute of observation.</p>

<p>Later that day, at 1:21 p.m. in Golden, another observer reported seeing three to five orbs rotating in a circular motion near the moon. The sighting lasted approximately three minutes.</p>

<p>On December 14, at 9:24 p.m., a sighting in Centennial involved three round lights in a triangle formation moving silently across the sky. The observation lasted for about three seconds.</p>

<p>Two additional reports came on December 19 at 4:30 a.m. from Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs, both describing white flashes in the sky. A video taken during these incidents showed erratic movement of the lights.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It was a circular-shaped object, kind of like a disc. The color was gray with a silver shine, almost metallic when light hit it,” the Lakewood skywatcher reported.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I watched for about three minutes and then they disappeared. When I looked away they had such bright lights it affected my eyesight,” said the observer from Golden.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have been reported with increased frequency in areas near military bases, such as Colorado Springs, which is home to a military installation. Reports often include unusual lights and sounds, contributing to ongoing public interest and speculation about aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Historically, various explanations for UFO sightings have included misidentified aircraft, natural phenomena, or even military exercises. The National UFO Reporting Center continues to investigate and document these occurrences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The National UFO Reporting Center is expected to continue its investigation into these sightings. Further analysis of the reported incidents will be conducted to determine if any patterns emerge or if additional information can be gathered from witnesses.</p>
