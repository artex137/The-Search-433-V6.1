      <h2>Scientist estimates interstellar object 3I/Atlas beamed the Wow! Signal 48 years ago</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has proposed that interstellar comet 3I/Atlas may have emitted the Wow! Signal detected on August 15, 1977. Loeb's calculations suggest that 3I/Atlas is travelling from the same region in space as the signal's origin, raising questions about the nature of the transmission.</p>

<p>This revelation matters as it could reshape understanding of the Wow! Signal, which has remained unexplained for decades. Loeb's findings may prompt further investigations into the comet's potential radio transmission capabilities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Signal detected: August 15, 1977</li>
    <li>Comet speed: 221,000 km/hr (60,000 km/s)</li>
    <li>Distance of 3I/Atlas in 1977: about 600 times the Earth-Sun separation (AU)</li>
    <li>Probability of alignment: 0.6 per cent</li>
    <li>Signal power: 0.5–2 gigawatts</li>
    <li>Next close approach to Mars: October 3, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Wow! Signal was recorded on August 15, 1977, by SETI astronomer Jerry R. Ehman using the Ohio State University’s Big Ear radio telescope. The signal was so unusual that Ehman noted "Wow" on a piece of paper, giving the signal its name. Over the years, scientists have attempted to decipher its origin, but it has remained an anomaly.</p>

<p>Recently, Loeb has analyzed the trajectory of 3I/Atlas and its proximity to the coordinates of the Wow! Signal. He concluded that the two celestial objects are aligned closely enough to warrant consideration of 3I/Atlas as a potential source of the signal.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Wow! Signal originated from the sky coordinates of Right Ascension (RA)=19h25m=291 degrees and Declination (Dec)=-27 degrees,” Loeb stated. “The chance of two random directions in the sky being aligned to that level is about 0.6 per cent.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Wow! Signal has puzzled scientists since its detection, with various theories proposed over the years without conclusive evidence. Recent studies have indicated that the signal may have been stronger than previously thought and could have come from within the Milky Way. The signal's intensity is estimated to be between 54–212 Jansky, suggesting a powerful source.</p>

<p>Loeb's assertion that 3I/Atlas may be linked to the Wow! Signal adds a new dimension to ongoing research into interstellar objects and their potential for communication.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are expected to investigate whether 3I/Atlas emits any radio transmissions as it approaches Mars on October 3, 2023. Observations will be made using the CaSSIS camera onboard ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter and the Mars Express’s High Resolution Stereo Camera.</p>
