      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-13 23:42 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS interstellar comet is currently moving towards Earth and will make its closest approach on December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometers). Authorities have confirmed that the comet poses no danger to the planet.</p>

<p>This event has sparked discussions online, with some linking the date to fear and religious concepts like judgement day. However, scientists have stated that these claims lack scientific backing. The comet's trajectory is stable and well understood, and it will not impact Earth or cause any disruptions to daily life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach date:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 170 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 130,000 miles per hour (210,000 kilometers per hour)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Third interstellar object discovered</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, while traveling at a high velocity. Since then, astronomers have tracked its path through the solar system. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023. Observations indicate a stable trajectory with no risk of collision.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches, scientists have noted that it may exhibit changes in behavior. These changes are typical for comets and include the release of gases or small outbursts, which will be monitored after December 19.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is real, but the fear is not. It poses no danger to Earth,” said a representative from NOIRLab.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There is no risk of collision. Observations show a stable trajectory,” added an astronomer involved in tracking the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever discovered, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike typical comets that originate from the outer solar system, this comet comes from another star system. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates that it will exit the solar system and will not return.</p>

<p>Scientists believe that 3I/ATLAS may be the largest and oldest interstellar object observed to date, providing valuable insights into conditions beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS after its closest approach, focusing on any changes in its behavior and collecting data that could enhance understanding of interstellar materials.</p>
