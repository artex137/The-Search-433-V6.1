      <h2>3I/ATLAS updates: What the interstellar object is made of and its exact current location</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed Mars, providing a rare glimpse of an interstellar object, according to the European Space Agency (ESA). The comet was photographed by the ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter last week, approximately 18.6 million miles from the spacecraft.</p>

<p>This event is significant for scientists and space enthusiasts as it offers insights into the composition of objects from beyond our solar system. ESA has released images showing the comet as a faint dot in the vastness of space, prompting continued interest and analysis from astronomers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July.</li>
    <li>The comet passed Mars on October 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>It is approximately 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than typical targets.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the sun is expected around October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope is monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet poses no threat to Earth, remaining about 170 million miles away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The tracking of comet 3I/ATLAS began after its discovery in July 2023. ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter started observing the comet on October 1, when it was approximately 18.6 million miles from Mars. The orbiter captured images over a week, culminating in the release of images on October 10, 2023.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches the sun, scientists plan further observations using the James Webb Space Telescope, Parker Solar Probe, and SPHEREx space observatory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every planet, moon, asteroid, comet and lifeform in our solar system share a common origin,” ESA stated. “But interstellar comets are true outsiders, carrying clues about the formation of worlds far beyond our own.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the orbiter, described the observation as “very challenging,” noting that “the comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 2017’s ‘Oumuamua and 2019’s 2I/Borisov. These comets are of particular interest due to their origins in distant star systems, providing valuable data for understanding cosmic formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, with further observations planned to analyze its composition and trajectory. The comet is expected to reappear in early December as it exits the solar system.</p>
