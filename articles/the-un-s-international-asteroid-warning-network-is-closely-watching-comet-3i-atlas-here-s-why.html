      <h2>The UN's International Asteroid Warning Network is closely watching comet 3I/ATLAS. Here's why.</h2>

<p>The United Nations' International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) is currently monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach scheduled for December 19, 2023. The comet will come within approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) of the planet, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this event.</p>

<p>This monitoring effort is critical for improving the accuracy of tracking near-Earth objects, according to James Bauer, a principal investigator at IAWN and a research professor in the astronomy department at the University of Maryland. The IAWN consists of over 80 observatories and citizen scientists globally, who are working on research related to comets and asteroids. Findings from the ongoing campaign are expected to be published in a peer-reviewed journal next year.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth, with a close encounter on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will be approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) from Earth.</li>
    <li>IAWN has conducted this monitoring campaign since October 2024.</li>
    <li>The campaign has attracted 171 participants, including citizen scientists and observatories.</li>
    <li>IAWN has published findings in a peer-reviewed journal, expected next year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in late June 2023. The IAWN began its observing campaign in October 2024, focusing on tracking this interstellar object. The campaign is now about halfway through, with the closest approach scheduled for December 19, 2023.</p>

<p>During a mid-campaign teleconference held on December 9, 2023, there were 100 participants discussing the observations and methodologies for tracking the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The idea behind these campaigns is really to strengthen the technical capabilities for measuring sky positions, which we call astrometry, for asteroids and comets,” said James Bauer, principal investigator at IAWN.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We want the community to use the latest and greatest techniques,” Bauer added regarding the campaign's objectives.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The IAWN has been active since its establishment in 2017. Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as the first interstellar object to be tracked under the IAWN's current observing campaigns. Previous campaigns have included monitoring the near-Earth asteroid Apophis in 2020 and 2021, with another planned observation period scheduled for 2027 to 2029.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will continue its observations of comet 3I/ATLAS until its closest approach and will publish findings in a peer-reviewed journal next year. Researchers aim to refine their tracking techniques for future near-Earth objects.</p>
