      <h2>China tests UFO-like drone resembling US Navy’s 2015 ‘Gimbal’ sighting</h2>

<p>China has successfully tested a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone that resembles the unidentified flying object reported by a US Navy pilot in 2015. Researchers at Zhengzhou University of Aeronautics conducted the test approximately 12 hours ago, showcasing a drone with a profile similar to the “Gimbal” incident, which drew global attention nearly a decade ago.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it highlights advancements in drone technology and the potential applications for military and environmental monitoring. Authorities are examining the drone's capabilities, which include modular payloads for various missions, from surveillance to emergency response.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Test conducted by Zhengzhou University of Aeronautics, China.</li>
    <li>Drone design echoes the 2015 “Gimbal” incident reported by a US Navy pilot.</li>
    <li>Aircraft features an elliptical wing design with four rotors for lift.</li>
    <li>Potential applications include battlefield surveillance and environmental monitoring.</li>
    <li>Research team led by Professor Liu Zhanhe.</li>
    <li>Test flight data indicates significant gains in lift efficiency.</li>
    <li>Challenges include reducing aerodynamic drag and refining control algorithms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Approximately a day ago, researchers at Zhengzhou University of Aeronautics demonstrated their new VTOL drone. The drone's design is inspired by the Gimbal incident, which was recorded by an F/A-18 Super Hornet and declassified in 2021. This incident has raised questions about unidentified aerial phenomena and advanced aerospace technology since its occurrence.</p>

<p>The research team's project leader, Professor Liu Zhanhe, has stated that the drone aims to combine the advantages of both multirotor and fixed-wing aircraft. The development process included simulations and test flights that confirmed the drone's improved lift efficiency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It has the best of both worlds from multi-rotor and fixed-wing aircraft,” said Professor Liu Zhanhe, summarizing the drone's capabilities in a peer-reviewed paper earlier this year.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 2015 “Gimbal” incident, which involved a US Navy pilot's encounter with a spindle-shaped UFO, has fueled ongoing discussions about advanced aerial technologies. The incident remains unexplained, and Chinese researchers now assert that their drone demonstrates practical aerodynamic advantages through unconventional designs.</p>

<p>Chinese scientists are also exploring additional streamlined VTOL designs for naval deployment, indicating a growing focus on integrating advanced drone technology into military operations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research team plans to address challenges related to aerodynamic drag and control algorithms before further testing. Continued development may lead to enhanced capabilities for various missions, including environmental monitoring and emergency response.
