      <h2>Real or fake? Mysterious 3I/ATLAS video sparks global debate over possible interstellar visitor</h2>

<p>A video featuring the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has generated widespread discussion online, with some users suggesting it may be an alien spacecraft. The clip, titled “A mysterious visitor from space: 3I ATLAS – under alien control?” has reignited speculation about extraterrestrial life, although astronomers have dismissed these claims, stating the object's unusual signals and behavior are natural.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar visitor to enter our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. The comet, which was first spotted in July, is moving at nearly 209,000 kilometres per hour and is believed to have formed about seven billion years ago in another star system. Recent interest has surged after radio emissions were detected from the comet by South Africa’s MeerKAT radio telescope around October 29, coinciding with its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object in our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet was first observed in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is travelling at approximately 209,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Radio emissions were detected on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 18, 2023, at a distance of 269 million km.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency are monitoring its trajectory towards Jupiter in early 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet was first spotted in July 2023. On October 29, radio emissions were detected by the MeerKAT radio telescope during its closest approach to the Sun. Following this, speculation about alien communications arose, but experts clarified that the emissions resulted from natural processes.</p>
<p>In early October, NASA noted similar water activity from the comet, reinforcing the understanding of its natural behaviour. The comet's sudden brightening and color changes during its solar pass have been attributed to the vaporization of ice and gas jets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The emissions were caused by hydroxyl radicals created when sunlight breaks down water molecules, a common process known as outgassing,” scientists explained.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Any unexpected acceleration was due to petrol fumes rather than propulsion,” NASA experts stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior incidents involving interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, have often spurred debate and speculation about extraterrestrial life. Scientific investigations into these objects have historically focused on their natural characteristics and origins.</p>
<p>Recent observations of 3I/ATLAS have prompted discussions among experts regarding its unusual properties, with some suggesting that the blue tint observed could indicate an artificial source, while others argue it is likely due to ionised carbon monoxide.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and heads toward Jupiter in early 2026. No investigations or charges are pending at this time, and further observations are expected in the coming weeks.</p>
