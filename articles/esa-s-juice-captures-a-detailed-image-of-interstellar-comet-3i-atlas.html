      <h2>ESA’s JUICE captures a detailed image of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s (ESA) JUICE spacecraft has captured a detailed image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first observed on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet, traveling on a hyperbolic trajectory, is notable for originating from interstellar space, a phenomenon that has been observed only twice before.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study material formed around another star. As 3I/ATLAS approached the Sun, it became active, shedding gas and dust, which allowed JUICE to capture images just days after the comet’s closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>JUICE took images between November 2 and 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling on a hyperbolic path, indicating it is from interstellar space.</li>
    <li>JUICE’s observation occurred near the comet’s peak activity.</li>
    <li>Data transmission from JUICE will be completed in February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first identified comet 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following calculations of its orbit, scientists determined it was not from the Solar System due to its hyperbolic trajectory.</p>

<p>As the comet approached the Sun, it exhibited typical comet behavior, forming a coma and tails. By November 2025, JUICE, originally designed for a mission to Jupiter, redirected its instruments to capture images of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>Between November 2 and 25, the spacecraft successfully captured images of the comet, revealing a bright coma and two distinct tails. The data from these observations will be transmitted back to Earth, with complete details expected in February 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The fact that a spacecraft like JUICE, millions of kilometers from Earth, managed to capture a clean image is remarkable,” a spokesperson for ESA stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 2025, only two interstellar comets, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, had been confirmed. The arrival of 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity for scientists to study the composition of interstellar material, which may differ from Solar System comets.</p>

<p>Ground-based observations have suggested that 3I/ATLAS may contain higher levels of carbon dioxide compared to many Solar System comets, indicating it might have formed under different conditions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will analyze the data received from JUICE in February 2026. This analysis could provide insights into the composition of 3I/ATLAS and enhance our understanding of comet formation across different star systems.</p>
