      <h2>Rare chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS challenges scientists and suggests origin of ancient star system</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, identified on July 1, 2025, has captured the attention of scientists worldwide due to its unusual chemical composition. The object, which is the third interstellar object ever observed, was detected by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile and is currently passing through our solar system. It is traveling at a high speed of 58 km/s relative to the Sun.</p>

<p>The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have led to a significant observation campaign utilizing powerful instruments, including the James Webb and Hubble space telescopes. Researchers aim to understand the comet's origins, which may date back over 7 billion years, potentially before the formation of our solar system. The findings could provide insights into the distribution of organic compounds across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Traveling at speeds of up to 61 km/s during its approach.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at approximately 1.5 astronomical units (AU).</li>
    <li>Passed Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Initial detection classified it as an asteroid; later confirmed as a comet due to visible coma.</li>
    <li>Contains eight times more carbon dioxide (CO2) than water vapor, a unique pattern among comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, when it was 670 million kilometers from the Sun, initially classified as an asteroid. Observations on July 2 revealed a developing coma and tail, leading to its reclassification as a comet. The Minor Planet Center confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, officially designating it as the third interstellar object.</p>

<p>The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a safe distance from the Sun, and made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Throughout this period, various space missions conducted observations to gather data on its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The data collected is consistent with an interstellar comet, and there is no evidence pointing to an artificial origin,” said a NASA representative during an official briefing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The absence of detectable torques, which usually alter the rotation of an active comet, is a rare phenomenon,” stated Professor Avi Loeb from the Universidade of Segundo.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, but its unique characteristics have sparked debate within the scientific community. While some researchers argue for its natural origin, others, like Loeb, suggest further investigation into its peculiarities is warranted.</p>

<p>The comet's stable brightness during its solar approach, unlike other comets that often fragment, adds another layer of complexity to its study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from various observatories and missions. The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS presents an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the conditions in ancient protoplanetary disks and the potential for organic materials in space.</p>
