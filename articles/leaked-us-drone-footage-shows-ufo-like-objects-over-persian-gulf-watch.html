      <h2>Leaked US drone footage shows UFO-like objects over Persian Gulf</h2>

<p>A one-minute video captured by a US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone in 2012 has resurfaced, showing glowing, triangular-shaped orbs moving over the Persian Gulf. The footage has reignited discussions about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), according to investigative journalists Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp, who released the video on their platform WEAPONIZED.</p>

<p>This footage matters as it adds to the ongoing conversation surrounding UAPs and has been officially categorized by the US Department of Defense as "non-human." The Pentagon has maintained a cautious stance on aerial encounters, noting that while some remain unexplained, there is no evidence supporting the existence of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video captured in 2012 by a US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone.</li>
    <li>Released by Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp on WEAPONIZED.</li>
    <li>Objects displayed triangular formation and abrupt changes in direction.</li>
    <li>US Department of Defense has designated objects as UAPs.</li>
    <li>Forward Looking Infrared Radar detected no conventional propulsion signatures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2012, a US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone recorded video of three bright orbs over the Persian Gulf. The footage remained archived until its recent release by Corbell and Knapp on February 7, 2026. Since its circulation, the video has gone viral on social media, prompting renewed interest in UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a military-recorded, sensor-generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends,” said Knapp.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Corbell described the objects as “playful,” noting their apparent awareness of each other’s positions and coordinated movement.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has consistently noted that while some aerial encounters are unexplained, there is no physical evidence confirming extraterrestrial technology or life. The release of this footage adds to a growing body of military-recorded encounters that continue to fuel public and scientific debate over unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the nature and origin of these UAPs are ongoing, as the public and scientific communities seek to understand the implications of such sightings.</p>
