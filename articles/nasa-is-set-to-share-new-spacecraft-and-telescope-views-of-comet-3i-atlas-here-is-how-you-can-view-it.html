      <h2>Nasa is set to share new spacecraft and telescope views of comet 3I/ATLAS: Here is how you can view it</h2>

<p>NASA is preparing to release new images and videos of comet 3I/ATLAS during a live event at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland on November 19 at 3 p.m. EST. The comet, first spotted on July 1 by the ATLAS observatory, is only the third known visitor from outside our solar system. NASA has stated that the comet poses no danger to Earth and will remain at a safe distance.</p>

<p>The event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to observe the behaviour and movement of an interstellar object. NASA has positioned its spacecraft and ground observatories to monitor the comet throughout its journey, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> November 19 (Wednesday)</li>
    <li><strong>Event Time:</strong> 3 p.m. EST (1:30 a.m. IST)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> About 19 million miles in early October</li>
    <li><strong>Platforms for live event:</strong> NASA+, NASA app, agency website, YouTube, Amazon Prime</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1 by the ATLAS observatory. NASA missions have monitored the comet since it entered the solar system. In early October, the comet passed within about 19 million miles of Mars. The upcoming live event will present new images and insights into the comet’s behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This comet offers a rare chance for scientists to watch how such an object moves and behaves,” said a NASA spokesperson.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The new images will help researchers understand how objects from outside our solar system change as they pass through our space neighbourhood,” said another NASA official.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is unusual as it is one of only three confirmed interstellar objects to have entered our solar system. Its study may provide insights into the origins and evolution of comets and other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The live event on November 19 will feature senior NASA leaders who will discuss the findings from the new images. The public can engage by submitting questions on social media using the hashtag #AskNASA, which may be addressed during the event.</p>
