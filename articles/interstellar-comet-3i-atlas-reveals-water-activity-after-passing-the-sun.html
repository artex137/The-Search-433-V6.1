      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals water activity after passing the Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), has shown measurable water activity following its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. Observations recorded by the Solar and Heliosphere Observatory indicate that the comet's nucleus has emitted hydrogen emissions, suggesting water production as it moves away from the Sun, according to Cornell University.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it provides insights into the behavior of interstellar comets and enhances understanding of their physical properties. Authorities, including astronomers at Cornell University and the Hubble Space Telescope, are analyzing the water production data to compare it with previous interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Hydrogen emissions detected by SWAN on November 6, 2025, indicated water activity.</li>
    <li>Water production rate measured at 3.17 × 10²⁹ molecules per second at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Water production decreased to between 1 × 10²⁸ and 2 × 10²⁸ molecules per second by early December 2025.</li>
    <li>Nucleus diameter estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Approximately 20 percent of the comet's surface was actively releasing water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion. Nine days later, on November 6, SWAN detected a hydrogen glow surrounding the comet, signaling water activity from its nucleus. Following this initial detection, astronomers observed a decline in water production over time, with rates dropping significantly by early December.</p>

<p>The methodology used for these observations has been established over years of study, allowing for consistent measurements across multiple comet apparitions. This data provides a comprehensive view of the comet's activity before and after its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These measurements provide a record of activity as 3I/ATLAS moved away from the Sun, capturing post-perihelion behaviour that complements prior observations,” said a representative from Cornell University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The decrease in water production corresponds with reduced sublimation of ice as the comet moved farther from the Sun,” noted the report from Universe Today.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar comets. Previous notable comets include ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, both of which provided crucial data regarding the characteristics of interstellar objects. The current findings help scientists understand how these comets behave as they interact with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory out of the Solar System, astronomers will monitor its hydrogen coma and water activity. Further analysis will enhance the understanding of interstellar comets and their physical properties.</p>
