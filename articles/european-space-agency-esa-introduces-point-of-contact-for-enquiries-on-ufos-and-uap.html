      <h2>European Space Agency ESA Introduces Point of Contact for Enquiries on UFOs and UAP</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has established an internal point of contact for public and media inquiries regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and anomalous phenomena (UAP), as announced by Senior Project Controller Philippe Ailleris during a presentation at the SETI & UAP Conference in Wuerzburg, Germany, last week.</p>

<p>This initiative aims to address growing public curiosity about UAP, particularly following space events like rocket launches and satellite reentries. Ailleris stated that while UAP are not part of ESA's formal mandate, the agency recognizes the importance of responding to public inquiries with transparency and scientific rigor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: ESA's introduction of a point of contact for UFO inquiries.</li>
    <li>Location: Online presentation from ESA's spaceport in Kourou, France.</li>
    <li>Date: Last week (exact date not disclosed).</li>
    <li>Presenter: Philippe Ailleris, Senior Project Controller at ESA.</li>
    <li>Conference: SETI & UAP Conference at the University of Wuerzburg.</li>
    <li>Agency: European Space Agency (ESA).</li>
    <li>Director General: Josef Aschbacher.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Philippe Ailleris has been active in the scientific investigation of UFO phenomena for several years. The latest announcement follows years of initiatives to engage with researchers and the public on this topic. In June, ESA representatives held an informal meeting with staff from the Interdisciplinary Research Center for Extraterrestrics (IFEX) at the University of Wuerzburg.</p>

<p>During his presentation last week, Ailleris articulated ESA's position on UAP and highlighted the agency's commitment to handling public inquiries responsibly. He clarified that there will be no dedicated UAP research office or funding at ESA.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “For ESA, UAP are not part of our mandate or our programs. However, questions from the public are unavoidable,” said Ailleris. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Our task is to respond consistently, objectively, and responsibly, guided by transparency, rigorous science, and the same spirit of exploration that drives our missions to Mars, to comets, icy moons, and exoplanets,” Ailleris added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “UFOs are of course always something that is very current and that always generates a lot of discussion. To be honest, we don’t work very much on it. But maybe we should address it more strongly,” said Josef Aschbacher in May during an ORF radio interview.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Interdisciplinary Research Center for Extraterrestrics (IFEX) at the University of Wuerzburg is Germany's first academic institution dedicated to the scientific study of UAP and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). Under Professor Hakan Kayal's direction, a network of civilian UFO researchers, journalists, and scientists collaborates to explore these phenomena.</p>

<p>Ailleris' recent statements reflect a broader trend within scientific communities to take public interest in UAP seriously, even if it remains outside their primary research focus.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Philippe Ailleris will serve as ESA's internal contact for UAP inquiries, ensuring a coordinated response to questions from the public and media. No specific deadlines or additional initiatives have been disclosed regarding future UAP research or funding. </p>
