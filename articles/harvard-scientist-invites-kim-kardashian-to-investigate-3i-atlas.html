      <h2>Harvard scientist invites Kim Kardashian to investigate 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has invited Kim Kardashian to join his research team in investigating the comet 3I/ATLAS. The invitation comes after Kardashian engaged with NASA's acting administrator on social media regarding the comet, which is currently passing through the Solar System. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This invitation highlights a growing interest in 3I/ATLAS, which is the third known interstellar comet. NASA has stated that the comet poses no danger to Earth. However, Loeb has raised concerns about the lack of access to critical data due to the U.S. government shutdown, which has impeded scientific research. He emphasized that the dissemination of scientific information should not be affected by political issues.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed there is no threat to Earth from the comet.</li>
    <li>Loeb leads the Galileo Project and the Black Hole Initiative at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth is on December 19.</li>
    <li>NASA’s HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images in early October.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October, NASA's HiRISE camera captured images of 3I/ATLAS. Following this, Kim Kardashian posted a question regarding the comet on X, which prompted a response from Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator. Duffy assured the public that the comet posed no threat to Earth.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb subsequently invited Kardashian to join his research team, citing the need for access to the images taken of the comet. He expressed concerns over the U.S. government shutdown affecting scientific data sharing.</p>
<p>As the comet made close passes near Jupiter, Venus, and Mars last week, observers noted several anomalies in its trajectory and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The dissemination of scientific information should not be held hostage to politics,”</blockquote> said Avi Loeb in a blog post. 
<blockquote>“We should be humble about what we know and curious about 3I/ATLAS rather than insist on conclusions before the data is analyzed,”</blockquote> he added.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS has grown due to its unusual characteristics, including its trajectory and composition. Previous interstellar objects have sparked debates within the scientific community regarding their origins and potential implications for extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Loeb has highlighted several irregularities in 3I/ATLAS, such as its nearly perfect alignment with the plane of the planets and the unusual release of nickel. These factors have led to speculation about the possibility of artificial design.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into 3I/ATLAS will continue as scientists seek to analyze upcoming observations. NASA maintains that the object is a natural interstellar comet and reiterates that there is no evidence of any threat as it approaches Earth.</p>
