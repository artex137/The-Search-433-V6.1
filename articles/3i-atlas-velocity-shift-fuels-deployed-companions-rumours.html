      <h2>3I/ATLAS 'Velocity Shift' Fuels 'Deployed Companions' Rumours</h2>

<p>A dramatic twist in cosmic discovery is unfolding as new evidence suggests that 3I/ATLAS has executed a velocity-shift manoeuvre and potentially deployed companion objects. This development has reignited speculation about the object’s origin and purpose. Astrophysicist Avi Loeb has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS experienced a significant change in speed after its perihelion passage, which occurred on 29 October 2025.</p>

<p>This matter is significant due to its implications for our understanding of interstellar objects. Authorities, including the U.S. Congress, are reportedly investigating the unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS. The object’s trajectory and motion do not match anything typically seen within our solar system, raising questions about whether it is purely natural or something more mysterious.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on 29 October 2025 at approximately 0.5 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth is scheduled for 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has stated that the velocity change was equivalent to a jet carrying five billion tons of matter.</li>
    <li>Rumours suggest 3I/ATLAS may have released smaller probes near Mars' orbit.</li>
    <li>NASA's lead scientist for small bodies maintains that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025. Following its discovery, the object approached the Sun, reaching perihelion on 29 October 2025. During this period, it underwent a velocity shift that has prompted discussions about possible companion objects being deployed.</p>
<p>As of now, the object's closest approach to Earth is set for 19 December 2025, intensifying the urgency for further observation and analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The key question is whether it deployed companions. We're treating this like a detective story."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Physicist Brian Cox dismissed the alien-craft theories, saying, "Comet 3I/ATLAS is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff. It is entirely natural in origin."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nasa's lead scientist for small bodies noted that, while the object has "some interesting properties," the evidence overwhelmingly supports its classification as a comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object discovered entering our solar system. Its unusual behaviour has sparked a debate within the scientific community about its nature, with some advocating for a natural origin while others suggest the possibility of an engineered visitor.</p>
<p>The combination of a hidden perihelion, unusual jets, and a 'blueing' effect has added to the intrigue surrounding 3I/ATLAS, making it one of the most compelling interstellar objects observed to date.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims of deployed companions and the velocity anomaly are ongoing. The scientific community will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely as it approaches Earth on 19 December 2025, seeking further data to confirm or refute the current theories.</p>
