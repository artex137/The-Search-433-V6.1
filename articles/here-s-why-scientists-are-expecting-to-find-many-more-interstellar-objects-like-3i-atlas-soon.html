      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Interest in Interstellar Objects</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor, was discovered in July 2025 while passing through our Solar System, according to the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey. This comet is one of only three known interstellar comets, alongside 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it suggests the existence of many more interstellar objects. Researchers believe that around 50 interstellar objects could be within the orbit of Jupiter at any time. Dr. Matthew Hopkins from the University of Oxford has noted that the upcoming Vera C Rubin Observatory will enhance the ability to detect these elusive objects, which have proven difficult to find.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Survey: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Age: Approximately 7 billion years</li>
    <li>Number of known interstellar comets: 3</li>
    <li>Predicted interstellar objects within Jupiter's orbit: 50</li>
    <li>Upcoming survey: Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. Researchers utilized the Ōtautahi-Oxford interstellar object population model to assess its characteristics. Analysis indicated that 3I/ATLAS is likely over seven billion years old, making it possibly the oldest comet observed.</p>
<p>Currently, 3I/ATLAS is behind the Sun and near its closest approach. It is expected to fade from the visibility of most telescopes within the next year.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Its existence implies that there were planetesimals in the Galaxy a very long time ago,” said Dr. Matthew Hopkins. “3I/ATLAS is like seeing a piece of that earlier Universe in our lifetimes.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS are rare. The difficulty in detecting them arises from their low reflectivity and the vast number of asteroids in space. Researchers anticipate that the LSST survey will significantly improve the identification of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its emergence from behind the Sun, researchers will study 3I/ATLAS's chemical composition to learn more about its origins and parent bodies. The LSST survey is also expected to uncover more interstellar objects in the future.</p>
