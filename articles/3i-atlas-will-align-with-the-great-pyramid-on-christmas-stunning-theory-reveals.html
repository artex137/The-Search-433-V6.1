      <h2>3I/ATLAS will align with the Great Pyramid on Christmas, stunning theory reveals</h2>

<p>An interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, has become the focus of a new theory suggesting it will align with the Great Pyramid of Giza on Christmas Eve 2025. Researcher David Sereda claims that the angles of jets emitted by 3I/ATLAS correspond to the architectural design of the ancient pyramids, hinting at a possible connection between the comet and the pyramids.</p>

<p>This theory matters as it proposes a new understanding of the Giza pyramids, suggesting they may have served as astronomical instruments designed to track celestial bodies. Authorities in the field of archaeology and astronomy are reviewing Sereda's findings, which challenge long-held beliefs about the purpose of the pyramids.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object currently travelling through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Research claims the jets of 3I/ATLAS have angles of 38–39°.</li>
    <li>The slope angles of the Giza pyramids are approximately 51.85° (Khufu), 51.84° (Khafre), and 51.34° (Menkaure).</li>
    <li>Sereda's analysis indicates that the angles of the jets correlate with the pyramids' design.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is predicted to align with the Great Pyramid's angle on December 24, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent analysis has highlighted a correlation between 3I/ATLAS and the Giza pyramids. David Sereda processed a negative image of 3I/ATLAS, identifying angles in its jets that match the pyramids' design. His findings suggest that the pyramids may have been built to track celestial objects.</p>

<p>Sereda claims that by analyzing the angles, he discovered that they fall within a range that corresponds to a hidden code in the pyramids' design. This theory culminates in the prediction of a significant alignment on Christmas Eve 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS will be within the angle of the Great Pyramid on Christmas Eve 2025,” said David Sereda, emphasizing the importance of this alignment.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This theory builds on previous research regarding the Giza pyramids, which have long been viewed primarily as tombs. The new perspective suggests they may also function as complex astronomical devices, tracking celestial movements over millennia. Earlier studies, including work by Peter Lemesurier, have explored similar ideas, proposing that the pyramids encode astronomical data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to evaluate Sereda's claims and their implications for our understanding of the Giza pyramids. Further analysis may provide insights into the potential relationship between ancient structures and celestial events.</p>
