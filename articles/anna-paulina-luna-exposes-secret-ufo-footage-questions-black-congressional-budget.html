      <h2>US Representative Anna Paulina Luna Exposes Secret UFO Footage, Questions Black Congressional Budget</h2>

<p>US Representative Anna Paulina Luna has intensified her push for transparency around UFO and UAP programmes, alleging that critical footage and data are being concealed under a classified 'black congressional budget.' Luna made her comments during interviews on The Joe Rogan Experience, FOX 13 Tampa Bay, and the Hindustan Times, highlighting concerns about the lack of oversight for programmes potentially involving advanced aircraft and unexplained phenomena.</p>

<p>Luna, who chairs the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, argues that both lawmakers and taxpayers are being shut out of significant data. She has called for greater congressional oversight and public accountability regarding these sensitive matters, asserting that the current lack of access presents both a national security risk and a challenge to democratic accountability.</p>
