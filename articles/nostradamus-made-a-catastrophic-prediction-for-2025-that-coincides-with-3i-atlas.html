      <h2>Nostradamus Made A Catastrophic Prediction For 2025 That Coincides With 3I Atlas</h2>

<p>A prophecy by Michel Nostradamus predicts a catastrophic situation for humanity by the end of 2025, which some have linked to the interstellar object Comet 3I Atlas. Nostradamus claimed that this event would jeopardize human existence due to a natural phenomenon beyond Earth's control. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this prediction.</p>

<p>This prediction has drawn attention as authorities and scientists monitor Comet 3I Atlas. While the comet is believed to align with Nostradamus's vision, NASA and other space agencies have stated that it poses no threat to Earth. The comet's closest approach will occur at a distance of about 1.8 astronomical units, approximately 270 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Nostradamus predicts a catastrophic event for humanity by the end of 2025.</li>
    <li>The prediction includes the return of a “great plague” and a long war ending.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I Atlas will come within 1.8 astronomical units of Earth, or about 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that Comet 3I Atlas poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach is not expected to cause any harm.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Michel Nostradamus made his prophecy regarding the end of 2025, stating that humanity would face significant threats due to natural events. In recent months, Comet 3I Atlas has been observed by scientists, with NASA confirming its trajectory.</p>
<p>NASA, along with space agencies from China and Europe, has indicated that Comet 3I Atlas will not endanger Earth during its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nostradamus stated, “From the cosmos, a ball of fire will rise, an omen of destiny, the world implores. Science and destiny in a cosmic dance, the fate of the Earth, a second chance.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nasa stated, “Comet 3I Atlas poses no threat to Earth and will remain very far away.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Nostradamus is known for his prophecies, many of which have been interpreted in various ways over the centuries. The mention of a great plague and wars resonates with historical events, including the Covid-19 pandemic that began in late 2019 and the ongoing geopolitical conflicts around the world.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor Comet 3I Atlas as it approaches Earth. There are currently no planned investigations or actions regarding the comet, as it has been deemed safe.</p>
