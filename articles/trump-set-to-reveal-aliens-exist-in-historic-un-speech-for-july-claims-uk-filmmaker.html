      <h2>Trump 'Set to Reveal Aliens Exist' in Historic UN Speech for July, Claims UK Filmmaker</h2>

<p>A British filmmaker has claimed that former President Donald Trump has written a speech confirming the existence of extraterrestrial life, scheduled for delivery on 8 July 2026, coinciding with the anniversary of the Roswell incident. The filmmaker, Mark Christopher Lee, asserts that the speech will be made at the United Nations, although no official confirmation has been provided.</p>

<p>The claim has sparked renewed interest in UFOs and has drawn reactions from both supporters and skeptics. Lee, known for his documentaries on UFO history, stated he was informed by a Trump administration insider about the planned announcement. The alleged speech could mark a significant moment in the ongoing discourse surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena and government transparency.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Claim made by UK filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee.</li>
    <li>Alleged speech scheduled for 8 July 2026.</li>
    <li>Speech tied to the anniversary of the Roswell incident from 1947.</li>
    <li>No official confirmation from Trump or the White House.</li>
    <li>Lee has documented UFO history, including the Rendlesham Forest incident.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, the US military issued a press release claiming it had recovered a flying disc near Roswell, New Mexico. This announcement was later retracted, stating it was a weather balloon, which has since become a pivotal moment in UFO lore.</p>
<p>Recently, Mark Christopher Lee claimed that a Trump insider revealed plans for a disclosure speech, initially suggested for a UN address but later specified for 8 July 2026. Lee argues that the timing is intentional, linking the speech to the original Roswell announcement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Partial UFO disclosure always begins with Roswell,” said Mark Christopher Lee, indicating that the speech would confirm the existence of recovered crafts and occupants.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Roswell incident has been a cornerstone of UFO mythology, with various theories regarding government cover-ups and the existence of alien technology. The claim of a forthcoming speech has been met with skepticism, as previous announcements of imminent disclosures have often failed to materialize.</p>
<p>Critics point out that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and they question the credibility of the information being circulated by Lee. The White House has not commented on the alleged speech, and analysts suggest that Trump is currently focused on other pressing political issues.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, the claim remains unverified, and July 8, 2026, is a date that has generated both excitement and caution among UFO enthusiasts and skeptics alike. The situation will develop as the date approaches, with observers watching for any official announcements or confirmations. </p>
