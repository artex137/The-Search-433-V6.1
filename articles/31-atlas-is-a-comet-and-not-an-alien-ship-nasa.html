      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-20 04:54 UTC</p>

      <h2>31/ Atlas is a comet and not an alien ship: NASA</h2>

<p>The US space agency NASA has confirmed that a recently observed object passing by Mars is a comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, and not an alien spacecraft, despite ongoing online speculation. The announcement was made on Wednesday following the release of new images of the comet, which flew by Mars last month.</p>

<p>This clarification is significant as it addresses public curiosity and speculation regarding the object's nature, especially during the recent US government shutdown that limited NASA's ability to respond to inquiries. NASA has utilized various scientific platforms, including the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes, to analyze the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object identified as comet 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>NASA released images of the comet on Wednesday.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth will be 167 million miles (269 million kilometres) in mid-December.</li>
    <li>NASA has studied the comet using over a dozen scientific platforms.</li>
    <li>European Space Agency satellites also observed the object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA first detected comet 3I/ATLAS as it approached Mars last month. Following the sighting, speculation arose regarding its nature, particularly during the US government shutdown when NASA could not respond. On Wednesday, NASA released new images and confirmed the object is indeed a comet.</p>

<p>NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya emphasized the importance of addressing public curiosity, stating, "I think it's important that we talk about that. This object is a comet." The agency's investigations have shown that all evidence points to it behaving like a comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "We were quick to be able to say, 'Yup, it definitely behaves like a comet.' We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet.” 
    — Nicola Fox, Associate Administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Speculation about unidentified objects in space has been common, particularly during periods of limited communication from space agencies. Previous incidents have sparked similar discussions, often fueled by public interest in extraterrestrial life. NASA's transparent approach in this case aims to mitigate misinformation and clarify the nature of celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it makes its closest approach to Earth in mid-December. The agency plans to utilize its scientific resources to further study the comet and its trajectory out of the solar system.</p>
