      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Lights Up December Skies: X-Ray Glow, Life-Building Molecules and How to Watch the December 19 Flyby</h2>

<p>As of December 11, 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has become the most closely observed object in the night sky, according to NASA and multiple observatories. The comet has recently been detected in X-rays and has shown a chemical profile rich in compounds associated with life. It is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing approximately 1.8 astronomical units (AU) from the planet, equivalent to about 170 million miles (270 million kilometres).</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the first X-ray detection of an interstellar comet, adding to our understanding of these celestial bodies. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are conducting observation campaigns and providing guidance on how to view 3I/ATLAS during its flyby.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 1.8 AU (170 million miles or 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>First reported:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>X-ray detection:</strong> First-ever detection from an interstellar comet, conducted by the XRISM mission</li>
    <li><strong>Chemical composition:</strong> Detected methanol and hydrogen cyanide, with methanol accounting for about 8% of vapor escaping the comet</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> Closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Estimated at magnitude ~12 or fainter, requiring a moderately powerful telescope to observe</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first reported on July 1, 2025, following its detection by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025, skimming inside the orbit of Mars.</p>
<p>On December 11, 2025, it passed less than two degrees from the half Moon, providing a useful reference for observers. By this date, the comet had moved more than 90° away from the Sun, making it accessible for night sky observation.</p>
<p>Between November 26 and 28, 2025, the XRISM mission conducted a special observation of the comet, resulting in the detection of X-rays. Additionally, ALMA in Chile mapped the presence of methanol and hydrogen cyanide in the comet's coma during several dates from August to October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This detection adds 3I/ATLAS to the family of X-ray-emitting comets previously seen in our own Solar System,” a JAXA statement noted regarding the comet's X-ray glow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Seeing methanol and hydrogen cyanide so abundant in an interstellar comet hints that life-friendly chemistry might be common in planetary systems across the galaxy,” said a NASA astrochemist involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its orbit is classified as strongly hyperbolic, indicating it does not loop around the Sun but rather swings by and continues into deep space.</p>
<p>Previous observations of comets, such as 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, have found similar chemicals, including hydrogen sulfide, which has been linked to a “rotten egg” smell. The presence of these compounds in 3I/ATLAS aligns with findings from Solar System comets, albeit in more extreme concentrations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to refine their observations and data on the comet. Public observation campaigns are underway, providing guidance for telescope users to view the comet during its flyby on December 19, 2025.</p>
