      <h2>Super-Fast New Comet Could Be Evil 'Alien Technology,' Harvard Professor Argues — but Other Experts Disagree</h2>

<p>A new comet named 3I/ATLAS, discovered speeding through our solar system, has sparked debate among scientists regarding its origins. The comet, first spotted on July 1, 2023, by a telescope in Chile, has been described in a recent research paper co-written by Harvard University physicist Avi Loeb as potentially being “alien technology” and possibly hostile. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</p>

<p>This discussion matters as it highlights differing views on the nature of celestial bodies and the implications for understanding extraterrestrial life. Authorities, particularly NASA, have clarified that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and is simply an interstellar comet formed in another solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2023, in Chile.</li>
    <li>It is traveling at a speed of 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun by the end of October 2023, remaining 130 million miles away.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object discovered, following Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>NASA is currently investigating the comet's size and physical properties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023, by a telescope in Chile. Observations dating back to mid-June have also been recorded. The comet is predicted to reach its closest approach to the Sun at the end of October 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, Harvard University physicist, stated, “We should put all possibilities on the table that it's a rock, a comet, or something else until we get the evidence, the data that will tell us what it is.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Samantha Lawler, an astronomer at the University of Regina, commented, “All evidence points to this being an ordinary comet that was ejected from another solar system.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Darryl Seligman from Michigan State University added, “There have been numerous telescopic observations of 3I/ATLAS demonstrating that it's displaying classical signatures of cometary activity.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS mirrors previous discussions about other interstellar objects, such as Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have also raised questions regarding their origins and implications for extraterrestrial life. The scientific community generally favors explanations based on observable data and established astronomical principles.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers worldwide are continuing to investigate the physical properties of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, with further observations expected in the coming weeks.</p>
