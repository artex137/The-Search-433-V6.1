      <h2>This is the closest look at the 3I/Atlas comet</h2>

<p>NASA has revealed close-up pictures of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through our solar system. The comet, which is not gravitationally bound to the Sun, will eventually return to interstellar space and will not return.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides researchers with a rare opportunity to study material from beyond our solar system. The European Space Agency (ESA) and several NASA spacecraft have focused on the comet, particularly as it made its closest approach to Mars last month, located just 29 million kilometres away.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is racing through space at more than 61 kilometres per second.</li>
    <li>It will come closest to Earth at a distance of 269 million kilometres in mid-December.</li>
    <li>The comet was first captured by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object ever observed, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The size of the comet is estimated to range from 440 meters to 5.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>Data from ESA's Juice spacecraft will not be available until February 2024 due to antenna limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, 3I/ATLAS was first captured by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. The comet has since been observed by multiple spacecraft, including ESA's two satellites and NASA's assets near Mars. Last month, the comet passed Mars at a distance of 29 million kilometres. It is expected to make its closest approach to Earth in mid-December 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s associate administrator.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We will get better on that one,” said Thomas Statler, a lead scientist at NASA. “The shape of the nucleus is also difficult to pin down because generally we're not resolving it in our observations.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The 3I/ATLAS is not just... a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our earth and our sun,” Statler added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as the third interstellar object observed in our solar system. Prior to this, ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov were the only other known interstellar objects. The study of 3I/ATLAS provides insights into the materials and conditions present in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observations from the Juice spacecraft will provide additional data in February 2024, enhancing our understanding of this interstellar comet.</p>
