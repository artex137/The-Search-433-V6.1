      <h2>Congress probes UFOs in hearing on whistleblowers, transparency</h2>

<p>On September 10, 2025, a congressional oversight panel in Washington, D.C. held a hearing focused on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), commonly referred to as UFOs. The nearly three-hour session featured testimony from military whistleblowers and included a video showing a missile striking an unidentified object.</p>

<p>This hearing is part of a broader effort by Congress to address concerns about transparency and accountability regarding UAPs. Lawmakers have expressed worries that the federal government may be suppressing information related to UAP sightings, which have seen an increase in recent years. In 2023, the Pentagon received more than 700 reports of UAPs, prompting further scrutiny of government practices.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: September 10, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Number of reports: Over 700 UAP reports made to the Pentagon in 2023</li>
    <li>Video footage: Allegedly shows a missile striking an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen in October 2024</li>
    <li>Whistleblowers: Included Air Force veterans Dylan Borland and Jeffrey Nuccetelli</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, the Pentagon received over 700 reports of UAPs, leading to increased public interest and congressional hearings on the topic. On September 10, 2025, the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee conducted a hearing where whistleblowers shared their experiences with UAPs. During the hearing, Rep. Eric Burlison presented a video that purportedly shows a missile striking a flying object.</p>

<p>Witnesses, including military veterans, testified about their encounters with UAPs. Dylan Borland described a sighting at Langley Air Force Base in 2021, while Jeffrey Nuccetelli recounted multiple incidents at Vandenberg Air Force Base.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is not science fiction or creating speculation. This is about national security, government accountability and the American people's right to the truth.” — Rep. Anna Paulina Luna</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The question is no longer whether these events are real, but whether we have the courage to face them.” — Jeffrey Nuccetelli</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The public should be seeing this stuff, and why you're not allowed to, I don't know.” — Journalist George Knapp</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing follows a series of reports and testimonies that suggest a growing concern over UAPs and the government’s handling of information surrounding them. Previous hearings have raised allegations of a potential government cover-up regarding UAP sightings. Lawmakers have called for improved whistleblower protections to encourage military personnel to come forward with their experiences.</p>

<p>Rep. Jasmine Crockett highlighted issues with over-classification in the federal government, linking it to historical events where the public has been kept uninformed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress plans to continue its investigations into UAPs and the government's transparency regarding the phenomena. Lawmakers are expected to push for enhanced whistleblower protections and increased public access to UAP-related information.</p>
