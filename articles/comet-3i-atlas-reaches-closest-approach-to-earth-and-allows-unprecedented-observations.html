      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas reaches closest approach to Earth and allows unprecedented observations</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has reached its closest approach to Earth at approximately 270 million kilometers on January 13, 2026, allowing astronomers to conduct detailed observations without any risk of collision. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile, has confirmed its origin outside of the Solar System due to its hyperbolic trajectory and high speed, exceeding 220,000 km/h.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it offers valuable insights into the formation of distant planetary systems. The observations made with advanced telescopes, including the Hubble, have revealed unique characteristics of the comet, which may help scientists understand the processes that govern planetary formation across the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach occurred on January 13, 2026, at 270 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at speeds exceeding 220,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, was on October 29, 2025, at approximately 210 million kilometers from Sol.</li>
    <li>Core diameter is estimated between 600 and 800 meters.</li>
    <li>Comet displays unique chemical composition with an excess of nickel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system. Observations have been ongoing since then, with significant findings reported from the Hubble telescope and ground-based instruments in Chile. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, and has exhibited increasing activity as it approached the Sun. The closest approach to Earth occurred on January 13, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All evidence points to a natural comet, ruling out hypotheses of artificial origin,” said representatives from NASA in November 2025.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar visitor, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. These comets provide crucial data on the chemical makeup of other planetary systems and help scientists understand the origins of water and prebiotic compounds on Earth-like planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future research will focus on analyzing the chemical composition of 3I/Atlas and comparing it with previous interstellar visitors. This analysis may take months or years, contributing to the understanding of cosmic objects from other stars.</p>
