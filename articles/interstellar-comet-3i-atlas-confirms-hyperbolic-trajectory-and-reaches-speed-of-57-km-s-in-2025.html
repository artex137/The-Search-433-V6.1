      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas Confirms Hyperbolic Trajectory and Reaches Speed of 57 km/s in 2025</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has been confirmed to be moving at a speed of 57 kilometers per second as it passes through the Solar System in 2025, according to astronomers. This comet, cataloged as 3I/Atlas, follows a hyperbolic trajectory, which means it will not be captured by the Sun's gravity and will only make a single pass through our Solar System before returning to deep space.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it positions 3I/Atlas as the third confirmed interstellar object observed, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Scientists have noted that the high speed of 3I/Atlas surpasses that of its predecessors, offering a rare opportunity to study material originating from another star system, which could provide insights into the formation of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 57 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Trajectory:</strong> Hyperbolic</li>
    <li><strong>Observations:</strong> Confirmed by astronomers in 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar objects:</strong> ‘Oumuamua (2017) and Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Current studies:</strong> Analyzing chemical composition and trajectory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, the first interstellar visitor, ‘Oumuamua, was detected, followed by Borisov in 2019. The detection of 3I/Atlas in 2025 marks a significant milestone in the study of interstellar objects.</p>
<p>Throughout 2025, astronomers have conducted continuous observations to accurately map the comet's outward path into deep space. The main interaction with the Sun will occur over a few weeks, with predictions for its perihelion, the point of maximum approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The high velocity of 3I/Atlas reinforces its extrasolar origin and allows scientists to gather valuable data on the conditions that formed it,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The passage of interstellar objects like 3I/Atlas provides critical information about the diversity of planetary systems in the galaxy. Unlike comets originating from our Solar System, interstellar comets maintain a high velocity due to their galactic environment. Previous interstellar visitors have displayed unique characteristics that have intrigued scientists and expanded our understanding of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The global astronomical community will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas throughout its passage in 2025, utilizing telescopes and spectrographs to gather as much information as possible about this rare celestial object.</p>
