      <h2>'Who put them there?' Scientists struggle to explain UFO-like objects captured in 1950s astronomy photos</h2>

<p>Researchers have identified strange star-like objects in astronomy photos from the 1950s that may be linked to UFOs. The National Geographic Society conducted a significant astronomical survey at the Palomar Observatory in California from 1949 to 1958, capturing thousands of photographs of the sky.</p>

<p>This research raises questions about the origins of these objects, particularly in relation to nuclear testing during the same period. Scientists are now analyzing data to understand the associations between these transients and historical events, including nuclear weapons tests.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Palomar Observatory Sky Survey spanned from 1949 to 1958.</li>
    <li>Researchers analyzed data from November 19, 1949, to April 28, 1957.</li>
    <li>They identified 107,875 transient events over 310 days during this period.</li>
    <li>Nuclear tests occurred on 123 days within the study timeframe.</li>
    <li>Transient sightings were 45% more likely on days of nuclear testing.</li>
    <li>For each additional UFO report, there was an 8.5% increase in observed transients.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between 1949 and 1958, the National Geographic Society conducted a comprehensive survey of the night sky from the Palomar Observatory. This effort produced a detailed map of celestial objects, including numerous transient star-like phenomena.</p>
<p>In October 2023, Stephen Bruehl and Beatriz Villarroel published a peer-reviewed study in the journal Scientific Reports, analyzing the relationship between these transients and nuclear testing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "We've ruled out some of the prosaic explanations, and it means we have to at least consider the possibility that these might be artificial objects from somewhere," said Stephen Bruehl, a professor at Vanderbilt University.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "For every additional UAP reported on a given date, there was an 8.5% increase in number of transients identified," Bruehl and Villarroel wrote in their study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies have explored the possibility of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) being linked to nuclear testing. The connection between nuclear events and atmospheric disturbances has been a subject of interest for researchers, especially concerning their potential impact on the environment.</p>
<p>Bruehl and Villarroel's findings suggest a need for further investigation into the nature of these transients and their possible artificial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing investigations will focus on analyzing further data related to these transients and their potential links to historical nuclear tests and UAP sightings. Researchers aim to clarify the origins and implications of these mysterious phenomena.</p>
