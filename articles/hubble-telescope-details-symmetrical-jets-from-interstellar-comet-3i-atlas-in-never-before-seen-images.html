      <h2>Hubble Telescope details symmetrical jets from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in never-before-seen images</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing symmetrical jets emanating from the comet’s nucleus. These images were taken over the past few weeks, providing unprecedented views of the comet as it travels through our solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers studying the composition and behavior of comets from outside our solar system. The data gathered from Hubble's observations will help scientists better understand the origins of these celestial objects and their potential impact on the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2019.</li>
<li>The Hubble images were captured in January 2026.</li>
<li>The comet is currently traveling through the inner solar system.</li>
<li>Hubble’s observations provide a detailed view of the comet's jets for the first time.</li>
<li>The discovery was made by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope team.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2019, initially drawing attention for its unusual trajectory. In January 2026, astronomers utilized the Hubble Space Telescope to observe the comet closely, capturing images that reveal its symmetrical jets.</p>

<p>These images represent a significant advancement in our understanding of interstellar comets, as they show features that have never been observed before.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The jets of 3I/ATLAS are a remarkable sight and provide valuable insights into the characteristics of interstellar comets,” said a spokesperson for the Hubble Space Telescope team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this observation, interstellar comets had been studied primarily through indirect measurements. 3I/ATLAS is particularly noteworthy as it is one of the few interstellar objects to be observed in such detail.</p>

<p>This observation aligns with ongoing efforts by scientists to explore and understand the dynamics of objects originating from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to analyze the data collected from Hubble's observations further. This analysis will help enhance our understanding of the comet and inform future studies on interstellar objects.</p>
