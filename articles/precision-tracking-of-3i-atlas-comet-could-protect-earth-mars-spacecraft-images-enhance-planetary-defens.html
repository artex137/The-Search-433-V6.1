      <h2>Precision tracking of 3I/ATLAS comet could protect Earth, Mars spacecraft images enhance planetary defense</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s (ESA) ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) has successfully tracked comet 3I/ATLAS with ten times greater accuracy than previous Earth-based observations, marking a significant advancement in planetary defense. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, is currently traversing the solar system but does not pose a threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This enhanced tracking capability is crucial for planetary defense, as it helps scientists prepare for potential future hazards from interstellar objects. By utilizing the unique vantage point of Mars, ESA has improved the accuracy of trajectory predictions, enabling better monitoring of celestial objects that could threaten Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at speeds up to 155,000 mph (250,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>ESA’s ExoMars TGO orbited Mars approximately 29 million kilometers from the comet during its closest approach in early October.</li>
    <li>The comet passed no closer than about 270 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
    <li>This tracking represents the first astrometric measurements submitted to the Minor Planet Center database from a spacecraft orbiting another planet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered, making its way through the solar system. In early October 2025, ESA’s ExoMars TGO captured data from a unique vantage point, allowing for a tenfold reduction in trajectory uncertainty. This data enables scientists to make precise predictions about the comet's path.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to exit the solar system soon, but monitoring will continue with ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), which will observe the comet in a more active phase post-solar approach in early 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The more accurately we can predict the trajectories of celestial objects, the better we can protect ourselves against any unknown,” said an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The successful tracking of comet 3I/ATLAS illustrates the potential of using resources not originally designed for asteroid detection to enhance planetary defense strategies. This advancement in tracking capabilities builds a foundation for future early-warning systems that could mitigate risks from extraterrestrial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS and analyze data from the JUICE mission, which is expected to provide insights in early 2026. This ongoing research is part of a broader effort to strengthen planetary defense initiatives.</p>
