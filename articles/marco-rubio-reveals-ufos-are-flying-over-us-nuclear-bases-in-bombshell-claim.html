      <h2>Marco Rubio reveals UFOs are flying over US nuclear bases in bombshell claim</h2>

<p>Unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been spotted over restricted US nuclear facilities, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He made the statement in a trailer for the upcoming documentary, <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, released on November 21, 2025.</p>

<p>This revelation raises concerns about national security and the potential implications of non-human intelligence operating near sensitive military sites. Rubio, a close ally of former President Donald Trump, emphasized that the information surrounding these sightings is so classified that even presidents are only briefed on a need-to-know basis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rubio stated sightings occurred over US nuclear facilities.</li>
<li>The documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> is set to stream on Prime Video.</li>
<li>The film includes claims of an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligence.</li>
<li>Rubio highlighted reports of unidentified objects in restricted airspace.</li>
<li>Past incidents include the 1947 Roswell incident and a 1967 event at Malmstrom Air Force Base.</li>
<li>Declassified Pentagon videos from 2004 and 2015 show Navy pilots encountering unidentified objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the mid-20th century, Allied pilots reported "foo fighters" during World War II, which were glowing spheres following aircraft. This phenomenon sparked early theories about advanced surveillance technology.</p>
<p>The 1947 Roswell incident occurred when an alleged "flying disc" reportedly crashed near a New Mexico Army Air Field. The military initially claimed the recovery of a "flying saucer" but later retracted it, stating it was a weather balloon.</p>
<p>In 1967, at Montana's Malmstrom Air Force Base, UFOs allegedly disabled US nuclear missiles. Then-Captain Robert Salas reported a glowing disc hovering overhead as all 10 Minuteman missiles shut down unexpectedly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There had been reports of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities that wasn’t American-made,” Rubio said. “The intelligence keeps me up at night.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s a crucial topic,” Rubio added, emphasizing the need to explore potential threats from sophisticated or extraterrestrial origins.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone,” said Luis Elizondo, former head of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This latest claim from Rubio builds on a long history of UFO encounters linked to nuclear facilities. The events at Malmstrom Air Force Base in 1967 have fueled speculation about extraterrestrial technology potentially interfering with nuclear capabilities.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has acknowledged the occurrence of "unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft" in military zones, leading to improved reporting procedures for the Navy. Declassified footage from Pentagon investigations supports claims of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations into these sightings continue, officials are expected to reassess the implications for national security and airspace protocols over sensitive military locations. Further inquiries into the nature of these unidentified objects may follow. </p>
