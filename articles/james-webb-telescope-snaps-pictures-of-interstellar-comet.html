      <h2>James Webb Telescope snaps pictures of interstellar comet</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has captured images of the interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on July 1, 2025. The comet is believed to be the third object found traveling through our solar system that originated from another star.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers, as studying comets like 3I/ATLAS can provide insights into the conditions present in other star systems during their formation. Researchers aim to compare these findings with what is known about the early solar system, which formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Origin: Interstellar space</li>
    <li>Image Captured: August 28, 2025</li>
    <li>Significant Findings: Highest ratio of carbon dioxide to water observed in a comet</li>
    <li>No risk to Earth, according to NASA</li>
    <li>James Webb Space Telescope launched: December 25, 2021</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered the comet 3I/ATLAS through the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The James Webb Space Telescope subsequently captured images of the comet on August 28, 2025. NASA confirmed that the comet poses no risk to Earth.</p>

<p>Researchers have identified that 3I/ATLAS contains carbon dioxide, water, water ice, carbon monoxide, and carbonyl sulfide. The comet's unique composition may offer clues about the environment in which it formed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Studying comets like this helps us learn about what conditions were like in those systems as they were forming,” said an astronomer studying 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS poses no risk to Earth,” confirmed NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope serves as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which will continue to operate until the 2030s. The ability to capture images of interstellar objects helps advance our understanding of the universe and the formation of solar systems.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of the few interstellar objects confirmed to have entered our solar system, providing a rare opportunity for research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to continue studying 3I/ATLAS before it exits the solar system later this year, aiming to gather as much data as possible about its composition and formation conditions.</p>
