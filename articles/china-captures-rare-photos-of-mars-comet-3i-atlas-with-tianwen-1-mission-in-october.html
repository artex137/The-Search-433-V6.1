      <h2>China captures rare photos of Mars comet 3I/ATLAS with Tianwen-1 mission in October</h2>

<p>The China National Space Administration has released images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS captured by the Tianwen-1 probe during its close approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. The comet was approximately 29 million kilometers from the spacecraft at the time of the observation.</p>

<p>This observation is significant for space exploration as it allows scientists to study an object from another star system from Martian orbit. The Tianwen-1 mission, operational since February 2021, utilized its high-resolution camera to track the fast-moving comet, marking a milestone in the understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet approached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of 3I/ATLAS measures approximately 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet's anti-solar tail reached 56,000 kilometers by August 2025.</li>
    <li>Tianwen-1 was launched in July 2020 and has been operational since February 2021.</li>
    <li>The probe travels at a speed of 86 km/s, while the comet moves at 58 km/s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet, following a hyperbolic trajectory, confirms its interstellar origin. By October 3, 2025, the Tianwen-1 probe captures images of the comet during its close approach to Mars, approximately 29 million kilometers away. The comet reaches perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This observation marks a breakthrough in space exploration, allowing the study of a visitor to another star system from Martian orbit,” said a spokesperson for the China National Space Administration.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object in the Solar System. Its distinct reddish color and chemical composition suggest it formed in another star system. The comet's activity has remained stable since its initial detection, differing from typical Solar System comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data from the Tianwen-1 mission to gain further insights into the composition and behavior of comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System.</p>
