      <h2>Elon Musk Claims UFOs Are US Military Technology, Not Aliens</h2>

<p>Elon Musk has stated that most UFO sightings are likely linked to classified US military technology rather than extraterrestrial life during an interview with Tucker Carlson. His comments, reported by the New York Post, have sparked renewed debate over unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) as they coincide with findings from US government assessments that favour terrestrial explanations.</p>

<p>Musk's remarks are significant as they align with the latest report from the US government's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which reviewed 757 UAP reports and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origins. His position adds to the ongoing discourse about the nature of UFOs and the potential for military involvement in unexplained sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Musk made the claims during an interview with Tucker Carlson.</li>
    <li>The interview was reported by the New York Post.</li>
    <li>AARO reviewed 757 UAP reports from May 2023 to June 2024.</li>
    <li>No evidence was found to suggest extraterrestrial origins for the UAPs.</li>
    <li>Musk's Starlink satellite network has approximately 6,000 satellites in orbit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between May 2023 and June 2024, the AARO conducted a comprehensive review of 757 reports related to UAPs. The agency concluded that many incidents could be attributed to balloons, drones, birds, or commercial satellites. Musk's interview with Carlson occurred after these findings were published, reinforcing his perspective on the issue.</p>

<p>Musk emphasized that the objects observed in the sky do not resemble alien spacecraft and suggested that they are likely tied to advanced US military projects. He also noted that his company, SpaceX, has not encountered any alien spacecraft despite operating a large number of satellites.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “There are a bunch of classified programmes that are underway,” Musk said, referencing US military technology.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If I ever came across credible evidence of alien life, I would publish it immediately,” he added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Musk's assertions reflect a growing trend among experts and officials who advocate for transparency regarding UAP investigations. Previous incidents involving UAPs have led to speculation about their origins, with some witnesses claiming to have seen crafts displaying extraordinary capabilities. However, agencies like AARO have consistently stated that no data supports claims of non-human technology.</p>

<p>The debate surrounding UFOs has intensified with various whistleblower claims, including those from David Grusch, who alleged that the US government is concealing information about recovered non-human crafts. Nonetheless, official investigations have not corroborated these statements.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>With increasing political pressure for transparency in UAP investigations, public interest remains high. Musk's comments are expected to keep the discussion alive, especially if further findings emerge from SpaceX or government agencies. The official stance continues to assert that while many sightings require additional study, there is no confirmed evidence of extraterrestrial life associated with UFO reports.</p>
