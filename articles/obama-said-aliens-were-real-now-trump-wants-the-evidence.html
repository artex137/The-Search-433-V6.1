      <h2>Obama said aliens were real. Now Trump wants the evidence</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has suggested that aliens exist, prompting President Donald Trump to direct the Department of Defense (DOD) to release all government files related to extraterrestrial life and unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Trump made the announcement on Thursday evening, following Obama’s comments during a podcast earlier that week.</p>

<p>The White House's directive reflects a growing interest in UFOs and alien life, which has captured the attention of lawmakers from both political parties. Congress has been investigating these phenomena for years, and some members have expressed support for Trump’s decision to release the files, indicating that more hearings and briefings may be forthcoming.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Announcement made by Trump on Thursday evening.</li>
    <li>Trump has directed the DOD and related agencies to release files on extraterrestrial life and UFOs.</li>
    <li>Congress has been investigating UFOs for years, uniting both Republicans and Democrats.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 20, 2026, former President Obama discussed the existence of aliens during a podcast, stating, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them and they’re not being kept in Area 51.” This comment quickly garnered media attention.</p>
<p>Hours later, Trump responded to Obama’s remarks during a press interaction on Air Force One, stating, “(Obama) made a big mistake.”</p>
<p>Later that evening, Trump issued a directive to the DOD to begin the process of releasing relevant government files on extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Now the (Defense Department) can’t hide from our docs request anymore!”</blockquote>
<p>— Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent discussion on extraterrestrial life follows a long-standing interest in UFOs among researchers and the public. Obama's comments reignited debates surrounding government transparency on this subject. The Trump administration has previously aimed to declassify documents related to various historical events, reflecting a broader trend of increasing scrutiny over government-held information.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The DOD is expected to begin the process of identifying and releasing files on extraterrestrial life and UFOs, with potential hearings and briefings in Congress anticipated in the coming weeks.</p>
