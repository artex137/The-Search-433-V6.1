      <h2>Mars missions image Comet 3I/ATLAS during red planet flyby</h2>

<p>ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express have captured images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed near Mars on October 3, 2025. The comet was approximately 30 million km away from the orbiters during its closest approach.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insights into the behavior of interstellar comets as they approach the sun. Scientists from ESA have utilized both spacecraft to study the comet's characteristics, despite the challenges posed by its faintness.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 30 million km (18.5 million miles)</li>
    <li>Spacecraft involved: ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express</li>
    <li>First spotted: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Comet's age: Possibly 3 billion years older than the solar system</li>
    <li>Next observation: Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) in November 2025</li>
    <li>Expected data from Juice: February 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first identified comet 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Between October 1 and 7, 2025, ESA’s Mars orbiters turned their cameras towards the comet, with the closest approach occurring on October 3. The imaging was conducted by both ExoMars TGO and Mars Express, allowing scientists to gather data on the comet as it passed.</p>

<p>Following the flyby, scientists began analyzing the collected data to learn more about the comet's composition and behavior. This analysis will continue over the coming weeks and months.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target,” said Nick Thomas, Principal Investigator of the CaSSIS camera.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one,” stated Colin Wilson, Mars Express and ExoMars project scientist at ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet observed, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These comets, originating from outside the solar system, offer unique insights into the formation of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>ESA is also preparing the Comet Interceptor mission, set to launch in 2029, which aims to study potential targets, including pristine comets from the Oort Cloud or other interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data from the October 3 observations. The next significant observation of comet 3I/ATLAS is scheduled for November 2025, when the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer will approach the comet, potentially providing further insights into its characteristics.</p>
