      <h2>US Government Navigates Challenges Surrounding Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS During Shutdown</h2>

<p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, federal agencies, including NASA, have continued to monitor the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile in July. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this celestial body.</p>

<p>This situation highlights the ongoing efforts of authorities to understand the unusual characteristics and trajectory of 3I/ATLAS. NASA plans to consult with at least one congressional representative to discuss the comet, while calls for the timely release of data and imagery have increased since the budget impasse began on October 1.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected in July 2023 by ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Federal budget impasse began on October 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA plans discussions with congressional representatives regarding 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Public data related to the comet has not been released since October 1.</li>
    <li>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has requested more information from NASA.</li>
    <li>International Asteroid Warning Network will gather more data on 3I/ATLAS from late November through late January.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, the ATLAS telescope in Chile detected the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Since the onset of the government shutdown on October 1, federal agencies have faced challenges in releasing data related to the comet. Recently, discussions have been scheduled between NASA and congressional representatives to further investigate the comet's nature.</p>

<p>As of late November 2023, the International Asteroid Warning Network plans to begin a dedicated campaign to gather additional data on 3I/ATLAS, extending through late January 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The urgency to access imaging and data reflects a broader recognition of the scientific significance of 3I/ATLAS,” said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna in her correspondence with NASA’s Acting Administrator Sean Duffy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA and the European Space Agency have dismissed claims that 3I/ATLAS may be an alien probe, asserting that it is a natural comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has sparked discussions among astronomers regarding its properties and origins. Harvard University professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet may have characteristics that align with an artificial construct. However, both NASA and the European Space Agency have stated that it remains a natural entity.</p>

<p>The Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is also monitoring the comet but has classified it as falling outside their primary mission of investigating unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers expect that as 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory, it may provide significant insights into interstellar objects. Continuous observation will be critical as the comet exhibits changes in brightness and movement characteristics.</p>
