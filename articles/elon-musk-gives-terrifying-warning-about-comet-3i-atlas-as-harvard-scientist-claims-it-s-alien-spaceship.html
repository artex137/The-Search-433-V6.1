      <h2>Elon Musk gives warning about comet 3I/ATLAS, Harvard scientist claims it’s ‘alien spaceship’</h2>

<p>A massive interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention as it made its closest approach to the Sun last week. Measuring approximately the size of Manhattan, the comet has sparked discussions among astronomers and the public due to its unusual trajectory, which brought it close to Jupiter, Venus, and Mars.</p>

<p>This event has raised questions about the comet's nature and potential risks. Authorities, including NASA, have been monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely to track its path and ensure it poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is roughly the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>It passed unusually close to Jupiter, Venus, and Mars.</li>
    <li>Nasa confirmed it will safely pass at a distance of approximately 170 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>Elon Musk discussed the comet's trajectory on The Joe Rogan Experience.</li>
    <li>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggested it may exhibit signs of an artificial origin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Last week, comet 3I/ATLAS reached its closest approach to the Sun. Following this event, discussions about its unusual trajectory and characteristics began to circulate in the media. Elon Musk provided insights during a recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, where he expressed concerns about the comet’s potential impact. NASA later confirmed that the comet poses no immediate threat to Earth, monitoring its trajectory closely.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It’s a real problem if it hits,” Musk told Rogan. “Depending on the total mass, the thing could obliterate a continent… maybe worse.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This acceleration might be the technological signature of an internal engine,” Loeb wrote in a blog post regarding 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS reflects a broader fascination with interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial life. While NASA has assured the public that there is no danger from the comet, its unusual path and physical characteristics continue to intrigue scientists and enthusiasts alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to learn more about its composition and behavior. As more advanced telescopes and observation methods are developed, scientists hope to uncover new insights about this and similar objects in the cosmos.</p>
