      <h2>3I/ATLAS Will Be Visible on November 11 — Here are Some Skywatching Tips</h2>

<p>Space enthusiasts can expect to see interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS starting on 11 November 2025. The comet will light up the pre-dawn sky in the east as it becomes visible from Earth after months of tracking by astronomers.</p>

<p>This event is significant because 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. Its appearance provides a rare opportunity for direct observation of an object from another star system. Scientists have also noted the comet's intriguing history, which included speculation about possible artificial origins that has since been dismissed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will be visible starting 11 November 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will rise around 4:34 AM, reaching about 32 degrees above the horizon.</li>
    <li>Its brightness is estimated at magnitude 9.8, requiring telescopes for observation.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on 19 December 2025, at about 168 million miles away.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently about 329 million kilometres from Earth in the constellation Virgo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS made its closest pass to the Sun on 30 October 2025, coming within 130 million miles. As it rounded the Sun, gases on its surface vaporised, creating a faint glow. This reappearance allows skywatchers to see the comet again as it moves away from the Sun.</p>
<p>As of early November 2025, the comet lies within the constellation Virgo, with specific coordinates of Right Ascension 13h 11m 01s and Declination –05° 30' 28".</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Seeing 3I/ATLAS will not be easy. Its brightness is much dimmer than what human eyes can detect unaided,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object detected near our solar system. Unlike comets that orbit the Sun, interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS move unpredictably, complicating observation efforts.</p>
<p>Its faint bluish glow may be attributed to its interstellar material, but researchers have not determined why it appears bluer than typical comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its appearance in November, 3I/ATLAS will pass near Jupiter by March 2026 before continuing its journey out of the solar system, potentially never to return.</p>
