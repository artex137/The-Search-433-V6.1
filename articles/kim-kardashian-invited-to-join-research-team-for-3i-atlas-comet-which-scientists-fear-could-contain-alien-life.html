      <h2>Kim Kardashian invited to join research team for 3I/ATLAS comet</h2>

<p>A Harvard astrophysicist has invited Kim Kardashian to join his research team to investigate comet 3I/ATLAS, which is approaching Earth and could potentially contain alien technology. This invitation follows Kardashian's inquiry to NASA’s acting administrator Sean Duffy regarding the comet's unusual characteristics. The invitation comes amid a government shutdown that has hindered access to critical scientific data.</p>

<p>The situation has raised concerns among scientists, including Avi Loeb, who believe that the ongoing government shutdown is impeding vital research on 3I/ATLAS. The comet is scheduled to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, and scientists are eager to analyze data that could clarify the object's nature and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet observed in our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest fly-by to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The government shutdown has lasted for 35 days, affecting access to scientific data.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has identified at least 10 anomalies related to 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>NASA's HiRISE camera captured images of the comet on October 2 and 3, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2 and 3, 2025, NASA's HiRISE camera captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS. These images are crucial for guiding future observations. On November 4, 2025, Kim Kardashian publicly sought information about the comet from NASA's Sean Duffy, who responded quickly. Following this, Avi Loeb invited Kardashian to join his research team due to the urgency of the situation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The dissemination of scientific information should not be held hostage to the politics of the government shutdown,” said Avi Loeb in a blog post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Great question! @NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” stated Sean Duffy in response to Kardashian's inquiry.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ongoing government shutdown has limited access to important scientific data, raising concerns among researchers and lawmakers. Previous incidents of government funding interruptions have similarly impacted scientific research and data dissemination.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are urging the government to release the necessary data about 3I/ATLAS as soon as possible to facilitate ongoing research. The outcome of this investigation could have significant implications for understanding the comet's nature and composition before its closest approach to Earth.</p>
