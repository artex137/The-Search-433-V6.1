      <h2>Military Whistleblowers Testify on UFOs and Alleged Government Cover-Up</h2>

<p>A group of military whistleblowers has testified under oath about their experiences with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and accused the government of participating in a cover-up. The testimony took place during a hearing on Tuesday, chaired by GOP Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, who leads the House Oversight and Government Reform's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it aims to address concerns about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and the implications for national security. Congress is seeking to understand the extent of government knowledge and the potential risks associated with these sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The hearing occurred on Tuesday, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Testimonies included Air Force veterans Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Dylan Borland, and Navy veteran Alexandro Wiggins.</li>
    <li>Rep. Eric Burlison presented footage of an unidentified object being struck by a Hellfire missile off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024.</li>
    <li>Nuccetelli reported five unexplained incidents at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California between 2003 and 2005.</li>
    <li>Borland claimed to have witnessed a “100ft equilateral triangle” take off from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in 2012.</li>
    <li>Wiggins described seeing a “self-luminous tic-tac-shaped object” while aboard the USS Jackson in February 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, Rep. Eric Burlison displayed video footage of an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen during the hearing. The object was reportedly struck by a Hellfire missile but continued on its trajectory.</p>
<p>Between 2003 and 2005, Jeffrey Nuccetelli experienced five unexplained incidents at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 2012, Dylan Borland witnessed a triangular object take off from Langley Air Force Base, claiming it derailed his career after he reported it. In February 2023, Alexandro Wiggins saw a tic-tac-shaped object while on the USS Jackson.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That’s a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bounce [sic] right off, and it kept going,” said journalist George Knapp during the hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The documents from military and intelligence personnel behind closed doors admit that these things are real. They’re not fictitious,” Knapp added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While some people think of flying saucers when they hear these terms, it is vital that we focus on the real-world impact of UAPs on critical infrastructure, civilian safety, and national security,” stated Rep. Jasmine Crockett.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing is part of a growing interest in UAPs and government transparency regarding unidentified phenomena. Previous incidents and testimonies have raised questions about the nature of these sightings and the government's response.</p>
<p>NASA has stated it has not found evidence that UAPs have an extraterrestrial origin, emphasizing the need to focus on their potential impacts on safety and national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue its investigation into UAPs, with further hearings planned to address the implications for national security and to evaluate the government's disclosure policies.</p>
