      <h2>Military Whistleblowers Testify on UFOs, Claim Government Cover-Up</h2>
<p>A group of military whistleblowers has testified under oath about their encounters with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and alleged government involvement in a cover-up. The hearing took place on Tuesday, chaired by GOP Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, who leads the House Oversight and Government Reform's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.</p>

<p>This testimony is significant as it raises questions about the government's transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). The military witnesses have shared their experiences, and lawmakers are now calling for further investigation into these claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing date: Tuesday, October 10, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Witnesses included: Air Force veterans Jeffrey Nuccetelli, Dylan Borland, Navy veteran Alexandro Wiggins, and journalist George Knapp</li>
    <li>Notable video shown: Footage of an unidentified object off Yemen, struck by a Hellfire missile on October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Nuccetelli reported five unexplained incidents at Vandenberg Air Force Base from 2003 to 2005</li>
    <li>Borland claimed to have seen a 100ft equilateral triangle take off from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in 2012</li>
    <li>Wiggins described a tic-tac-shaped object seen off southern California in February 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 10, 2023, the House Oversight Committee held a hearing on UAPs where military whistleblowers provided testimony. Air Force veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli shared his experiences from 2003 to 2005 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Dylan Borland described an incident from 2012 at Langley Air Force Base, while Alexandro Wiggins detailed a sighting from February 2023. During the hearing, Rep. Eric Burlison presented video evidence of an unidentified object struck by a missile.</p>
<p>Journalist George Knapp highlighted government documents suggesting that intelligence officials acknowledge the existence of UFOs, claiming they are real and capable of outperforming known aircraft. The hearing concluded with calls for further investigation into the claims made by the witnesses.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That’s a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bounce [sic] right off, and it kept going,” said George Knapp during the hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The documents from military and intelligence personnel behind closed doors admit that these things are real. They’re not fictitious,” Knapp added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While some people think of flying saucers when they hear these terms, it is vital that we focus on the real-world impact of UAPs on critical infrastructure, civilian safety, and national security,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing follows a series of public and private discussions regarding UAPs and the military's role in investigating these phenomena. Previous incidents have raised concerns about national security and the potential implications of unidentified objects in controlled airspace. The government has faced scrutiny for its handling of information related to UAPs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers have indicated that further investigations will be conducted to evaluate the claims made by military witnesses. The House Oversight Committee may pursue additional hearings to explore the implications of UAPs on national security and public safety.</p>
