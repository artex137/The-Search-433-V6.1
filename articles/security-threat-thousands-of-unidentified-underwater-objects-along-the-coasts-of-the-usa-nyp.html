      <h2>Security threat: thousands of unidentified underwater objects along the coasts of the USA</h2>

<p>Thousands of unidentified underwater objects have been recorded near the US coast, prompting senior US Navy officials to warn that these phenomena may pose a national security threat. This information was reported by The New York Post.</p>

<p>The tracking app Enigma has documented over 9,000 mysterious incidents within 16 kilometers of the US coastline or large bodies of water as of August. Authorities are concerned about the implications of these unidentified objects, particularly after more than 150 reports describe objects hovering or submerging in water. The most significant occurrences have been reported in California and Florida.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Over 9,000 unidentified underwater objects recorded near US coasts.</li>
    <li>More than 150 reports of objects hovering or submerging in water.</li>
    <li>California reported 389 incidents; Florida reported 306 incidents.</li>
    <li>Retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet has expressed concerns about national security implications.</li>
    <li>USS Omaha recorded a UFO in July 2019 that disappeared after flying over US Navy facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2019, the USS Omaha recorded a UFO that vanished without a trace in the ocean after flying over US Navy facilities off the coast of San Diego. Following this, the Pentagon analyzed video footage, which highlighted potential threats to maritime security.</p>

<p>As of August 2023, the Enigma app has tracked over 9,000 incidents of unidentified underwater objects, with clusters of reports concentrated along the east and west coasts of the United States.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact that unidentified objects with unexplained characteristics enter US waters, and the Department of Defense does not raise a giant red flag, is a sign that the government is not sharing everything it knows about anomalous phenomena in all domains,” said retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet in a March 2024 report.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>While much of the scientific community remains skeptical about UFOs, the increasing number of reports raises concerns about maritime security. The potential for unidentified objects to operate undetected poses risks that authorities have yet to fully address.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the unidentified underwater objects are ongoing, with authorities expected to continue monitoring incidents and analyzing data collected through tracking applications.</p>
