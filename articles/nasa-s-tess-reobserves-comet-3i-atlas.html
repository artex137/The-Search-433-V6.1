      <h2>NASA’s TESS Reobserves Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has reobserved the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a special observation run from January 15 to 22, 2026. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the observations.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as scientists will use the data to analyze the comet’s activity and rotation. The findings will contribute to our understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics. TESS has made all data from the observation period publicly available as of January 27, 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation dates: January 15 to 22, 2026</li>
    <li>Data availability: January 27, 2026</li>
    <li>Comet brightness: approximately 11.5 in apparent magnitude</li>
    <li>Observation interruptions: January 15 to 18 due to TESS entering safe mode</li>
    <li>Data compiled by: Daniel Muthukrishna from MIT</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 15, 2026, TESS began its observation run of comet 3I/ATLAS. The spacecraft entered a safe mode on January 15, which temporarily interrupted the observations until January 18. Following this, data collection resumed, and TESS completed its observation period on January 22. The initial calibrated measurements were made public on January 19, and all data from the observation run became accessible on January 27.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The TESS spacecraft scans a wide swath of the sky for about a month at a time, looking for variations in the light from distant stars to spot orbiting exoplanets,” said Jeanette Kazmierczak from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>TESS previously observed comet 3I/ATLAS in May 2025, nearly two months before it was officially discovered. Astronomers have utilized TESS data to identify and monitor comets and asteroids, leveraging the spacecraft's wide field of view to track objects at great distances.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will analyze the data from the recent observations to further understand the characteristics of comet 3I/ATLAS. Future studies may provide additional insights into the behavior of interstellar comets.</p>
