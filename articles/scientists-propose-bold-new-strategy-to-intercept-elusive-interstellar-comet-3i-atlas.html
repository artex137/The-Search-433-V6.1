      <h2>Scientists Propose Bold New Strategy to Intercept Elusive Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A team of researchers from the Initiative for Interstellar Studies (i4is) has proposed a new plan to intercept comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object ever detected. Their proposal, outlined in a paper accepted for publication in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society (JBIS), suggests using an indirect Solar Oberth maneuver for a mission launching in 2035. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this proposal.</p>

<p>This mission is significant as it presents a unique opportunity to study material from beyond our solar system. The arrival of 3I/ATLAS has sparked substantial scientific interest, prompting multiple proposals for missions aimed at studying this celestial visitor. The proposal highlights the challenges posed by the comet's high speed and late detection, which complicate traditional mission designs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Proposed launch date: 2035</li>
    <li>Comet speed: over 60 km/s</li>
    <li>Research team: i4is, including Adam Hibberd, T. Marshall Eubanks, and Andreas Hein</li>
    <li>Publication: Journal of the British Interplanetary Society (JBIS)</li>
    <li>Mission strategy: indirect Solar Oberth maneuver</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected after it had already traveled inside the orbit of Jupiter, which limited the possibility of a direct intercept mission. Adam Hibberd noted the critical timing issue, stating that the optimal launch date for direct missions had passed by the time of detection.</p>
<p>In response to the challenges of high heliocentric speeds and late detection, Hibberd and his colleagues developed a more sophisticated trajectory design that utilizes the Sun's gravitational pull. This approach aims to maximize thrust efficiency and enable the probe to catch up with the rapidly receding comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "For the direct mission, the object 3I/ATLAS was detected too late... This was after the optimal launch date for a direct mission to intercept it."

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous mission proposals, including NASA's Janus mission and the European Space Agency's Comet Interceptor, envisioned direct transfer missions launched from Earth. However, the detection of 3I/ATLAS occurred too late for these options to be viable. The innovative strategy proposed by i4is reflects a shift toward more complex trajectory designs that account for the unique challenges presented by interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community will monitor the development of this proposal and its potential implementation. Future advancements in propulsion technology will also be crucial for the success of this and similar missions aimed at exploring interstellar objects.</p>
