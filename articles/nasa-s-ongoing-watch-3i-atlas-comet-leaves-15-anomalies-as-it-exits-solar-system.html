      <h2>NASA's ongoing watch: 3I/ATLAS comet leaves 15 'anomalies' as it exits Solar System</h2>

<p>As of December 19, 2025, NASA continues to monitor the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) as it makes its closest approach to Earth before exiting the Solar System. The comet, discovered in early 2025 by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey, is the third confirmed interstellar comet and has generated significant interest among astronomers due to its unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>This close encounter is important for both scientific understanding and planetary defence. NASA has emphasized the need for continued observations, while Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has raised concerns about 15 anomalies observed in the comet's behaviour that challenge traditional comet theories.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Early 2025 by ATLAS survey</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Anomalies:</strong> 15 peculiar characteristics noted by Avi Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Orbit Type:</strong> Retrograde and highly inclined</li>
    <li><strong>Proximity to Earth:</strong> Maintained a safe distance during closest approach</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early 2025 by the ATLAS survey. The comet has since traversed the inner Solar System, passing close to multiple planets including Jupiter, Mars, and Venus. On December 19, 2025, it reached its closest point to Earth before continuing its outbound journey.</p>

<p>NASA has provided updates on its observations, while Loeb has compiled a list of anomalies that suggest the comet's behaviour is not typical of standard comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We're continuing to observe the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it heads out of our solar system,” NASA posted on X from December 18.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike typical comets, which are bound to the Sun, interstellar comets travel on hyperbolic trajectories that take them in from distant stellar systems.</p>

<p>The anomalies identified by Loeb include jets pointing toward the Sun, unusual brightness behaviour, and a lack of expected carbon-based volatiles. These characteristics have led to discussions about whether the comet may not fit into conventional natural categories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it exits the Solar System. Further analysis may be conducted to understand the implications of the anomalies identified by Loeb and their significance in the study of interstellar objects.</p>
