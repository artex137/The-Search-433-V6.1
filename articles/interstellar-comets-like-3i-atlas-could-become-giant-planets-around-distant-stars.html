      <h2>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS could become giant planets around distant stars</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could play a crucial role in planet formation around massive stars, according to a study presented at the EPSC-DPS Joint Meeting 2025 in Helsinki, Finland, from September 7 to 12, 2025. The research suggests that these deep-space objects may provide a solution to longstanding questions about how large planets form in chaotic environments.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it challenges current theories on planet formation and suggests that interstellar objects could help explain the conditions necessary for creating gas giants like Jupiter. Scientists are exploring how capturing such objects might influence the formation process around young stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently passing through our Solar System.</li>
    <li>This comet is one of only three observed interstellar objects, alongside 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The study was presented by Professor Susanne Pfalzner from Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany.</li>
    <li>The EPSC-DPS Joint Meeting took place in Helsinki, Finland, from September 7 to 12, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, 1I/ʻOumuamua became the first interstellar object discovered in our Solar System. Following this, astronomers identified 2I/Borisov and later 3I/ATLAS. Recent studies have focused on how these objects can influence planet formation around young stars.</p>
<p>Professor Pfalzner's research utilizes computer simulations to propose that interstellar objects could be captured by the gravitational pull of young stars, potentially acting as seeds for the formation of giant planets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects may be able to jump start planet formation, in particular around higher-mass stars,” said Professor Susanne Pfalzner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Interstellar space would deliver ready-made seeds for the formation of the next generation of planets,” Pfalzner added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Current theories of planet formation struggle to explain how larger objects can form in the chaotic environments of dusty disks surrounding young stars. The traditional accretion process often leads to collisions that prevent larger bodies from forming. Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS may offer a new perspective on overcoming this barrier.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Professor Pfalzner plans to create further computer models to study how many captured interstellar objects could contribute to planet formation, advancing our understanding of the processes involved in creating giant planets around distant stars.</p>
