      <h2>3I/ATLAS reveals 7 jets and is it linked to Pyramids of Giza? Scientists study comet’s strange jet pattern</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has generated global interest after new images revealed seven distinct jets extending from its surface. The unusual alignment of these jets has sparked discussions about a potential connection to the layout of Egypt’s Pyramids of Giza. Scientists are currently analyzing data from observatories to determine the nature of 3I/ATLAS, its jets, and whether it is a natural comet or a technological object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has shown seven jets extending from its surface.</li>
    <li>Astronomer Frank Niebling captured new images of the jets on November 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The total mass of 3I/ATLAS may exceed 50 billion tons, with a diameter of at least 10 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The jets have been ejected for up to three months, with a gas outflow velocity of about 0.4 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Future observations with the Hubble and Webb telescopes are planned to study its structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 9, 2025, astronomers Frank Niebling and Michael Buchner used two telescopes to capture images of 3I/ATLAS, combining five exposures each lasting three minutes between 5:08 and 5:22 UT. These images revealed the distinct jets, including two directed towards the Sun and one extending away from it.</p>

<p>As social media discussions intensified, claims emerged that the jets' arrangement resembled the geometric alignment of the Pyramids of Giza. These claims remain unverified and lack scientific confirmation.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest proximity to Earth on December 19, 2025, drawing further scientific interest.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist, stated, “Science progresses through open investigation and evidence-based observation.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also noted that the probability of receiving such a large interstellar object in the solar system is less than one in a hundred million if it is purely natural.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object and its unique characteristics have prompted comparisons to other celestial phenomena. The scientific community is focused on assessing whether its features are the result of natural processes or technological origins.</p>

<p>Discussions linking 3I/ATLAS to historical structures like the Pyramids of Giza are based on social media speculation rather than scientific evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Upcoming spectroscopic observations will further investigate the jets' velocity, mass flux, and composition. These studies aim to clarify whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural or artificial object. Astronomers continue to prioritize measurable data amidst ongoing public interest in the comet's potential connections to ancient civilizations.</p>
