      <h2>Trump 'Fully Briefed' On Alien Hybrids Living Among Humans, Crashed UFOs, Claims Whistleblower</h2>

<p>Former US Air Force Major David Grusch has claimed that President Donald Trump has been “fully briefed” on the US government's alleged concealment of UFO retrievals and the existence of alien life. Grusch made the assertion during a recent interview, stating that Trump was shown classified intelligence regarding recovered crashed spacecraft and non-human biological remains.</p>

<p>This revelation raises significant questions about governmental transparency on extraterrestrial matters. Grusch, currently advising Congress’s UAP Task Force, suggested that declassifying this information could make Trump a pivotal figure in history. He indicated that members of the current administration are aware of these extraterrestrial realities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>David Grusch is a former US Air Force Major and intelligence officer.</li>
    <li>Grusch claims Trump was briefed on alien existence during his first term.</li>
    <li>Grusch has alleged the US military retrieved alien spacecraft and bodies.</li>
    <li>He served 14 years in the Air Force and worked with the National Reconnaissance Office.</li>
    <li>Grusch reported threats and intimidation for exposing information on extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison supports Grusch's claims about multiple alien species.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>David Grusch has reported on UFOs and extraterrestrial life since becoming a whistleblower in 2023. He alleges that secret government factions have operated UFO retrieval and reverse-engineering programs for decades. During his tenure between 2019 and 2021, Grusch represented the National Reconnaissance Office on the UAP Task Force.</p>

<p>In 2024, Trump indicated a willingness to declassify alien files during an interview on the Lex Fridman Podcast. Grusch has also stated that he informed members of Congress about multiple alien species, including the “Nordics” and the “Greys.”</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Members of this current administration are very well aware of this reality. Certainly, the current president is very knowledgeable on this subject,” said Grusch in an interview with Fox News.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“He [Grusch] said that the Nordic aliens are like a few hundred years more advanced than we are, but they're not super advanced,” stated Congressman Eric Burlison during an interview.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I was physically threatened even before I sent in my intelligence community inspector general report… I was literally in fear both professionally and in my personal life,” Grusch claimed.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>For decades, the Pentagon and previous administrations have denied any encounters with extraterrestrial beings despite numerous testimonies from civilians and military personnel. Grusch's allegations come amid heightened public and congressional interest in UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Grusch's claims of government concealment add to a growing discourse surrounding the potential existence of alien life and the nature of UFO sightings, often attributed to advanced technology or extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue investigating the claims made by Grusch and others regarding extraterrestrial life and government programs. The pressure on the White House to act on whistleblower revelations may lead to further disclosures regarding UFOs and related technologies.</p>
