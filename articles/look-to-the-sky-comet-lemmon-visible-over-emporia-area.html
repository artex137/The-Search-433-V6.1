      <h2>Look to the Sky: Comet 3I ATLAS Brightens the Night</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has captured the attention of astronomers and the public alike as it journeys through our solar system, with its closest approach to the Sun expected around October 30, 2025. The comet, which is currently not visible from Earth, poses no threat to our planet, according to NASA and local experts.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever detected, providing a unique opportunity for scientific study. NASA and astronomers are eager to learn more about its origins and characteristics as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass approximately 130 million miles from the Sun, just inside Mars' orbit.</li>
    <li>It is moving at a speed of 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>The diameter of its nucleus is estimated to be between 1,400 feet and 3.5 miles.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently too close to the Sun to be observed from Earth.</li>
    <li>It should reappear on the opposite side of the Sun by early December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected earlier this year, entering our solar system from beyond its boundaries. As it approaches the Sun, its speed increases, and it is expected to reach its closest point around October 30, 2025. Currently, it remains hidden from view due to its proximity to the Sun.</p>

<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth,” said Mark Brown, Director of Peterson Planetarium at Emporia State University.</blockquote>

<p>Brown added that the public's curiosity about the comet is understandable, especially since it is a new and unknown object.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet detected, following a growing interest in celestial phenomena and their origins. Previous interstellar comets have provided valuable insights into the formation of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS and expect to gain more observations and data once it reappears in December 2025. Scientists aim to learn as much as possible about this rare interstellar visitor.</p>
