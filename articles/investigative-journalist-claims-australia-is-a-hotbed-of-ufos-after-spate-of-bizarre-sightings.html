      <h2>Investigative journalist claims Australia is a 'hotbed' of UFOs after spate of bizarre sightings</h2>

<p>Investigative journalist Ross Coulthart has stated that Australia is a "hotbed" of UFO sightings following reports of unidentified objects over military bases, particularly RAAF Base Tindal in northern Australia. Coulthart made these claims during a podcast interview with businessman Mark Bouris, highlighting a recent increase in sightings and the involvement of military personnel.</p>

<p>Coulthart's assertions raise concerns about security and airspace breaches over sensitive military facilities. He noted that there are ongoing investigations into these sightings, with various authorities being alerted but unable to provide explanations for the objects observed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ross Coulthart has reported increased UFO sightings over military bases in Australia.</li>
    <li>Recent sightings include an object hovering over RAAF Base Tindal and another over Richmond in Sydney.</li>
    <li>Six workers at Fortescue Metals Group's Solomon mine site reported seeing a UFO at approximately 5 a.m. on December 7.</li>
    <li>Police coordinated a response to a mysterious object found on fire near a mining site in Newman in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Witness Harry Turner, a former head of the Defence Department's Joint Intelligence Organisation Nuclear Branch, has a history of UFO sightings dating back to the 1950s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, six workers at Fortescue Metals Group's Solomon mine site reported seeing an unidentified object while traveling at around 5 a.m. On October 2025, a large black object was discovered on fire near a mining site close to Newman, prompting a multi-agency police response. Prior to these incidents, there were reports of strange lights in the sky near Point Moore in Geraldton, which were investigated by Perth Observatory.</p>

<p>Coulthart has noted that these events are part of a larger pattern of unexplained phenomena observed over military installations in Australia.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These people are telling me that they're seeing UFOs. They're seeing anomalous objects. Nobody's been able to explain to them what they are.”</blockquote> — Ross Coulthart

<blockquote>“We’ve allowed ourselves to become Fortress Australia for America, and we’ve got, I suspect, nuclear weapons on northern soil in Australia. Nobody's talking about this.”</blockquote> — Ross Coulthart

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Australia has a history of UFO sightings, with reports dating back several decades. Former Defence Department scientist Harry Turner has advocated for the establishment of a dedicated team to investigate UFO incidents, citing his own experiences during nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s. The Department of Defence has been approached regarding its policies on the reporting of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), but a response has not been disclosed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the recent sightings are ongoing. Authorities are expected to continue monitoring airspace breaches and evaluating the security implications of these unidentified objects.</p>
