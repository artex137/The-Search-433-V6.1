      <h2>What is 3I/Atlas? Here's what to know about interstellar comets</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/Atlas, discovered by scientists in July 2025, is moving closer to Earth and is expected to reach its closest distance to the sun at the end of October. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system. Experts from NASA have stated that 3I/Atlas appears to be a natural comet, despite speculation from some astronomers, including Harvard's Avi Loeb, who suggest it could be an artificial object. The debate surrounding the object's origin and nature has generated significant online discourse.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object confirmed to enter our solar system.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb estimates a 30% to 40% chance that it is an artificial alien object.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is expected to reach its closest distance of 267 million kilometers from Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently approaching the sun, with its closest distance occurring at the end of October.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first detected in July 2025, marking its entry into the solar system. Since that time, scientists have observed its movement and noted unusual chemical patterns as it approaches the sun. The object has sparked debates about its nature, with various theories circulating online.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb has publicly discussed his theories regarding 3I/Atlas, including an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast on October 28, 2025. He speculated about the possibility of the comet being an artificial object sent to observe the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "For a spacecraft, perihelion is the optimal time for either acceleration or deceleration by an impulse from an engine, thanks to the gravitational assist from the sun," said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "This is also true of a mothership releasing mini-probes that maneuver towards the planets," Loeb added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Loeb's theories lack evidence,” noted NASA astronomers, who assert that 3I/Atlas seems to be a natural interstellar comet.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects are celestial bodies that originate from outside our solar system and travel through it. 3I/Atlas is part of a rare category of phenomena that has drawn attention from both scientists and the public. The debates surrounding its nature reflect broader discussions about the existence of extraterrestrial life and the potential for advanced technology beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its approach, astronomers will closely monitor its trajectory and chemical patterns. Further observations may clarify its nature, while discussions about its potential implications for humanity are expected to continue.</p>
