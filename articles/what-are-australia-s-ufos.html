      <h2>What are Australia’s ‘UFOs’?</h2>

<p>Strange lights in the sky have been reported across a large part of Western Australia, particularly in late September 2025. Witnesses have described various flashing formations, prompting speculation about the presence of UFOs. Authorities have not reported any injuries or fatalities related to these sightings.</p>

<p>The reports of unusual lights have sparked interest among the public and prompted inquiries into their origins. Local authorities are investigating potential explanations, including atmospheric phenomena and satellite activity. The Australian government has not confirmed any extraterrestrial involvement.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Locations: Various areas across Western Australia</li>
    <li>Reported Date: Late September 2025</li>
    <li>Confirmed Explanation: Starlink satellites</li>
    <li>Starlink Satellites in Orbit: Approximately 8,475</li>
    <li>Potential Future Starlink Satellites: Up to 42,000</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late September 2025, residents across Western Australia began reporting strange lights in the night sky. These sightings occurred shortly after a new batch of Starlink satellites was launched by SpaceX. Authorities conducted checks on aircraft flight patterns and military training activities but found no unusual activity.</p>

<p>As speculation grew, experts suggested that atmospheric phenomena, such as mirages, could be responsible for the sightings. However, the most convincing explanation has been identified as a formation of Starlink satellites, which can appear as strings of bright lights in the sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The lights are likely a train of Starlink satellites, which can create dramatic visual effects when they are in low Earth orbit,” said an unnamed expert in satellite technology.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior incidents of unexplained aerial phenomena have often led to public interest and speculation about UFOs. The rise in Starlink satellite launches has increased the frequency of similar sightings, as these satellites become more common in the night sky. Astronomers have raised concerns about the impact of these satellites on astronomical observations, as they can interfere with the visibility of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor reports of unusual lights in the sky and investigate any future sightings. Public awareness campaigns may be initiated to inform residents about the Starlink satellites and their visibility patterns.</p>
