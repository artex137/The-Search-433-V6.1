      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS becomes a fully active comet after perihelion</h2>

<p>NASA’s SPHEREx space telescope has observed interstellar object 3I/ATLAS transitioning into a fully active comet following its perihelion on October 30, 2025. The telescope detected a significant increase in activity in December 2025, including strong water outgassing and the emergence of new gas species.</p>

<p>This transformation is significant as it provides the clearest evidence that interstellar comet material can rapidly change when exposed to solar heating. NASA's observations indicate that 3I/ATLAS has shifted from being dominated by icy grains to exhibiting characteristics typical of active comets, which may enhance our understanding of cometary processes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Location during observations: 2.0–2.2 AU from the Sun (about 300–330 million km)</li>
    <li>Gas production rate: approximately 6 × 10<sup>27</sup> molecules per second</li>
    <li>Temperature of dust grain surfaces: approximately −3°C (27°F)</li>
    <li>Next observation scheduled for: April 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.35 AU from the Sun. Initial observations indicated it was primarily composed of icy grains. In December 2025, NASA’s SPHEREx conducted follow-up observations revealing increased activity, including water vapor emissions and the presence of new gas species.</p>
<p>The observations showed a transition in the comet's structure, with water ice fully sublimating and a shift from icy grains to refractory dust. These changes suggest a more active state for the comet as it moves away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The December observations indicate that solar heating has penetrated well below the surface layers that dominated pre-perihelion behavior,” said C.M. Lisse, lead author of the study. “This behavior mirrors what is inferred for Solar System Oort Cloud comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The findings from 3I/ATLAS are consistent with the behavior of other long-period comets in the Solar System. These comets often undergo similar transformations as they approach the Sun, becoming more active as they lose icy material and release gases. The study of 3I/ATLAS enhances our understanding of how interstellar material behaves in our solar neighborhood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of 3I/ATLAS's activity before its next scheduled observation in April 2026. This will allow scientists to track the comet's evolution as it moves away from the Sun.</p>
