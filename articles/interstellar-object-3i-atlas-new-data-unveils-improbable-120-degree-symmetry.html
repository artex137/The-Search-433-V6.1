      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS: New Data Unveils 'Improbable' 120-Degree Symmetry</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported new findings about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which was first discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile on July 1, 2025. The object made its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025, and is proving to be more complex than initially thought, according to data from NASA and other space agencies.</p>

<p>The implications of these findings are significant for our understanding of cometary physics. Researchers have observed that 3I/ATLAS exhibits a level of symmetry and activity that challenges existing models of comet behavior. The new data indicates that the object may possess unique internal structures and mechanisms that influence its behavior as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest flyby of Earth: December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars during observations: 29 million kilometres on October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size: 440 metres to 5.6 kilometres in diameter</li>
    <li>Velocity in early models: up to 120 kilometres per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile. Early images from NASA indicated a simple comet-like structure, with hydrogen gas sublimating from a frozen nucleus. However, as the object approached the sun on October 29, 2025, new data revealed organized jet systems and a high degree of geometric symmetry.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2025, observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter provided high-resolution images of the object, revealing more about its inner coma and nucleus. By December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest flyby of Earth, remaining observable until it exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The geometric precision of the features we’ve observed in 3I/ATLAS is statistically improbable for a natural, irregular icy body,” said Avi Loeb from Harvard University. “This configuration is hard to explain via standard cometary physics.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 1I/&#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The previous objects also challenged existing theories of cometary behavior, prompting scientists to reconsider their understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey back into interstellar space, researchers will analyze the data collected during its flybys. This research may lead to revised models of cometary behavior and a deeper understanding of the physical processes at play in such objects.</p>
