      <h2>As 3I/ATLAS passes by, Harvard astronomer asks "is it alien tech?"</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomer Abraham “Avi” Loeb has raised questions about the nature of the comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, with its closest proximity occurring on October 29, 2025. Loeb, a professor at Harvard University, has suggested that the interstellar object could potentially be alien technology, despite NASA classifying it strictly as a comet.</p>

<p>This inquiry into the origins of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it challenges conventional understanding of interstellar objects. NASA has reported that the comet holds the record for the highest velocity ever recorded for an interstellar object, traveling at 130,000 miles per hour. Loeb's comments have attracted attention from both the scientific community and the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> 130,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>NASA Classification:</strong> Comet</li>
    <li><strong>Loeb's Position:</strong> Suggests potential alien technology</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has since been tracked as it moves through the solar system. On October 29, 2025, it is expected to reach its closest point to the sun. Loeb has commented regularly on the object, exploring its implications for the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What I’m doing as an astrophysicist is looking at nature on the biggest stage, which is the universe,” said Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We have the duty to consider a low probability event, just because the implications are huge,” he added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What I write there is what I believe in,” said Loeb regarding his online commentary.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb has long been an advocate for exploring the possibility of alien life. His theories about interstellar objects, including 3I/ATLAS, have drawn both interest and skepticism from peers. Social media discussions about his work have been mixed, with some critics labeling him a fraud.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb plans to continue exploring the topic of 3I/ATLAS through his writings and public commentary, encouraging curiosity about the universe and the potential for alien technology.</p>
