      <h2>UFO Survives Direct Missile Strike Off Yemen Coast</h2>
<p>A video released during a congressional hearing on Tuesday appears to show a UFO surviving a direct missile strike off the coast of Yemen. The footage reportedly depicts the object regaining its balance after being hit by a Hellfire missile, which is designed for total destruction. No injuries or fatalities have been reported as a result of the incident.</p>

<p>This video has sparked renewed interest in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) among the public and authorities. The U.S. government has faced scrutiny regarding its transparency on such matters, with many questioning the extent of what is known about UFOs. This incident may lead to further investigations into military capabilities and the nature of the object captured in the footage.</p>
