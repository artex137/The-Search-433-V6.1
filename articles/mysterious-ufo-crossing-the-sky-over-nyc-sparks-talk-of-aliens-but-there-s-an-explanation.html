      <h2>Mysterious ‘UFO’ crossing the sky over NYC sparks talk of aliens — but there’s an explanation</h2>

<p>A mysterious orb of light with a glowing tail was spotted soaring across New York City’s skies early Tuesday morning, leading some to speculate about extraterrestrial life. No injuries or fatalities have been reported. The object was later identified as part of the Polaris Dawn mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Station in Florida at 5:23 a.m. and is carrying NASA scientists and a civilian crew.</p>

<p>This sighting matters as it highlights the public's fascination with space exploration and the potential for human activities in orbit to be misinterpreted. Authorities have clarified that the orb is not an alien spacecraft but part of a commercial space mission.</p>
