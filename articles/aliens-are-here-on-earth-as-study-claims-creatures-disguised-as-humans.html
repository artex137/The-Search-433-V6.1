      <h2>Aliens 'Are Here On Earth' As Study Claims Creatures Disguised As Humans</h2>

<p>Extraterrestrials are reportedly already on Earth, disguised as humans or residing in secret bases, according to a new scientific paper from Harvard University. The study suggests that these beings might be remnants of an ancient civilization or even time-travelers from the future. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to these claims.</p>

<p>This research has garnered attention as the Pentagon investigates approximately 1,650 UFO sightings, with a significant number reported between May 2023 and June 2024. Experts argue that understanding these claims could provide insights into the ongoing investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study co-authored by Michael Masters, Tim Lomas, and Brendan Case from Harvard University.</li>
    <li>Published in mid-July 2023 and subsequently removed from ResearchGate.</li>
    <li>Pentagon currently investigating around 1,650 UFO sightings.</li>
    <li>Approximately half of these sightings occurred between May 2023 and June 2024.</li>
    <li>Military officials deny that any UFOs are of alien origin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In mid-July 2023, a scholarly paper theorizing the presence of aliens on Earth was published by Harvard researchers. The paper suggested that extraterrestrials may be living among humans or in hidden locations. Shortly after its publication, the paper was removed from ResearchGate, prompting speculation about a potential cover-up.</p>

<p>As of now, the Pentagon continues to examine numerous UFO sightings reported by both military personnel and civilians, with an emphasis on those reported in the past year.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re not saying this is right, we’re not saying that this is absolutely 100 percent the case,” said Michael Masters, a professor at Montana Technological University. “We’re saying these are some potentialities that would explain the many UFO sightings that have been logged over the decades.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Bill Birnes, author of *UFOs and the White House*, stated, “I believe they have infiltrated the highest reaches of governments across the globe.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Reports of UFO sightings have increased in recent years, leading to heightened scrutiny from government agencies. The Pentagon’s investigation into UFOs has been ongoing, with officials consistently denying any connection to extraterrestrial life, despite the unexplained nature of many sightings.</p>

<p>Claims of extraterrestrial life have circulated for decades, with various authors and researchers asserting that aliens might be living among humans. Dr. Birnes has stated that these beings have existed on Earth for millions of years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Pentagon will continue its investigation into UFO sightings while researchers explore the implications of the recent study. Further developments regarding the paper and its claims are expected as the scientific community and authorities respond to the ongoing discourse surrounding UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</p>
