      <h2>Analysis of comet 3I/ATLAS by JAXA and NAOJ details its high speed and extrasolar origin</h2>

<p>Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) have released a detailed analysis of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing its high speed and extrasolar origin. The findings were published on February 6, 2026.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances the understanding of comets that originate outside our solar system. Authorities have stated that the data may provide insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies in different star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2020.</li>
    <li>It has a speed of approximately 100,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The comet is believed to have originated from the Oort Cloud, located beyond the solar system.</li>
    <li>JAXA and NAOJ have collaborated on this analysis.</li>
    <li>The findings were published on February 6, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in 2020. It was identified as an extrasolar object, prompting further study by JAXA and NAOJ. The agencies have conducted extensive analysis over the past years.</p>

<p>The recent publication of findings on February 6, 2026, marks a significant milestone in understanding the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The high speed of comet 3I/ATLAS is unprecedented for an object of its kind, and its extrasolar origin opens new avenues for research,” said Dr. Tanaka from JAXA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of the few known comets that have originated from beyond the solar system. Previous studies have focused on comets from within our solar system, making this discovery particularly valuable.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>JAXA and NAOJ plan to continue their observations of comet 3I/ATLAS to gather more data and improve understanding of its trajectory and composition.</p>
