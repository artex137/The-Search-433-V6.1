      <h2>Aliens to Reveal Themselves at 2026 FIFA World Cup</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee, a renowned UFO investigator and filmmaker, has predicted that aliens will disclose their existence during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which is set to take place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The announcement was made on December 23, 2025, as Lee cited prophecies from historical figures such as Nostradamus and Baba Vanga.</p>

<p>This prediction is significant as it suggests a potential global event that could reshape humanity's understanding of extraterrestrial life. Lee urges world leaders and the public to prepare for what he describes as a paradigm-shattering occurrence, emphasizing the need for international dialogue on UFO preparedness and transparency in investigations.</p>
