      <h2>Judge rules Salina violated First Amendment in ordering Cozy Inn to stop UFO-themed mural</h2>

<p>A federal judge has ruled that the City of Salina, Kansas, violated the First Amendment by ordering the Cozy Inn to cease painting a UFO-themed mural. The ruling was issued on Wednesday, November 19, 2025, after the restaurant owner, Steve Howard, filed a lawsuit in early 2024 with assistance from the Kansas Justice Institute.</p>

<p>This ruling is significant as it addresses the balance between municipal regulations and constitutional rights. The City of Salina had previously classified the mural as a regulated sign, arguing that the flying UFOs closely resembled hamburgers, which are the restaurant's signature item. Following the ruling, the City stated it is evaluating the implications of the court’s decision and considering potential next steps.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of ruling: November 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Salina, Kansas</li>
    <li>Plaintiff: Steve Howard, owner of Cozy Inn</li>
    <li>Assistance: Kansas Justice Institute</li>
    <li>Cozy Inn established: 1922</li>
    <li>Judge: Toby Crouse</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The dispute began in November 2023 when Salina officials instructed Howard to stop painting the mural. In early 2024, Howard filed a lawsuit challenging the City’s sign code. The case progressed through the courts, leading to the recent judgment by Judge Crouse.</p>

<p>In his opinion, Judge Crouse stated that Salina's definition of a sign was unlawful, asserting that the city cannot determine if a display is a mural or a sign without infringing on First Amendment rights. The ruling is detailed in a 35-page order released by the court.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Salina is my hometown, I love it here. I’m incredibly excited I get to finish my mural. The reason I love this community, this town, is because of all of the support everyone has given me. Thank you for standing behind me and supporting me through this,” said Howard.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The Court agreed with the City and held that the challenged provisions of the City’s Sign Code are not unconstitutionally vague. On the other hand, it also agreed with the Plaintiffs and held that the City’s definition of the term ‘sign’ violates the First Amendment,” the City of Salina stated in response to the ruling.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This ruling comes amid a broader discussion on the limits of municipal authority regarding artistic expression and signage. The Cozy Inn has been a staple in the Salina community for over a century, and this case highlights ongoing tensions between local regulations and individual rights.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The City of Salina is currently working with its attorneys to assess the broader implications of the court’s ruling and to determine potential next steps toward resolution of the matter.</p>
