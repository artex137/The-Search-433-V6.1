      <h2>New Image of 3I/ATLAS Shows Mysterious Sunward Jet Pointing the Wrong Way</h2>

<p>A new image of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has revealed a long, narrow sunward jet extending from its nucleus, raising questions about cometary behavior. The image was released on December 31, 2025, at 14:03.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges conventional understanding of comet physics. Scientists are currently investigating the forces and processes that could produce such an unusual feature, which is described as an anti-tail. The persistent nature of this structure highlights the complexity of interstellar objects and the need for ongoing observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image release: December 31, 2025</li>
    <li>Time of image release: 14:03</li>
    <li>Object in question: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Feature observed: sunward jet or anti-tail</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 31, 2025, astronomers released a new image of 3I/ATLAS, showcasing a peculiar sunward jet extending from the comet's nucleus. This jet has been noted for its unusual length and alignment with previous observations from the Hubble and Webb telescopes.</p>
<p>The discovery has prompted scientists to separate observed phenomena from expected cometary behavior, leading to further investigations into this anomaly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The structure is elongated, sharply defined, and directionally coherent,” scientists have stated, emphasizing the need for closer scrutiny of this feature.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS contributes to a growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects. Previous studies have indicated that such objects can display unexpected behaviors, necessitating continuous observation and research to understand their characteristics fully.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to investigate the sunward jet of 3I/ATLAS to uncover the underlying physics and processes responsible for this unusual feature. Further observations and analyses are expected in the coming months.</p>
