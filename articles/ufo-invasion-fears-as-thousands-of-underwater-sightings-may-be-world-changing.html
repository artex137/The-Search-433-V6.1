      <h2>UFO invasion fears as thousands of underwater sightings may be 'world-changing'</h2>

<p>Thousands of sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) have raised concerns about potential threats to national security, according to senior US Navy officials. The sightings, recorded by Enigma, a UFO-reporting app, have occurred within 10 miles of US coastlines and major bodies of water, reflecting a growing unease about unidentified phenomena in the ocean.</p>

<p>As of August, Enigma has logged over 9,000 unexplained sightings, with more than 150 reports detailing objects hovering above or entering the water. Authorities are now investigating these reports as they could indicate significant national security implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enigma has recorded over 9,000 USO sightings within 10 miles of US coastlines.</li>
    <li>More than 500 sightings occurred within just five miles of shore.</li>
    <li>California and Florida reported 389 and 306 USO sightings, respectively.</li>
    <li>Enigma has collected over 30,000 reports of UFOs and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) since late 2022.</li>
    <li>Notable incidents include a UFO documented by the USS Omaha in July 2019 that disappeared into the ocean.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2019, the USS Omaha reported a UFO that vanished into the ocean after flying near a Navy fleet off San Diego. This incident was part of a series of unexplained encounters, with reports indicating that US Navy vessels were surrounded by up to 100 UFOs over a month. Investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell shared radar footage showing nine unidentified objects on the USS Omaha’s radar on July 15, 2019.</p>

<p>Corbell also released footage of pyramid-shaped UFOs swarming the USS Russell during the same period. Reports of these sightings have led to increased scrutiny and concern regarding unidentified objects in US waters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena.”</blockquote>
<p>- Retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have been a topic of debate, often dismissed by the scientific community. However, the recent surge in USO sightings has prompted renewed interest. The Pentagon's UFO report and subsequent investigations have indicated that many sightings may not be easily explained by conventional means.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the reported sightings are ongoing, with authorities working to determine the nature and implications of these phenomena. No specific deadlines or charges have been disclosed at this time.</p>
