      <h2>'Major anomaly' comet weighing more than expected pictured hurtling past Mars</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/ATLAS, weighing more than 33 billion tons, has been observed passing close to Mars earlier this week. The European Space Agency (ESA) captured images of the comet as it came within 1.67 million miles of Mars' orbit between October 1 and October 7.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the size and composition of interstellar objects. Scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not on a collision course with Earth, but its characteristics have intrigued researchers. The comet, likely composed of carbon dioxide with a solid core of water and ice, presents a unique opportunity for study as it marks only the third time an interstellar object has entered Earth's solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Weight: Over 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: 1.67 million miles</li>
    <li>Observation period: October 1 to October 7, 2023</li>
    <li>Diameter of nucleus: Likely more than 3.1 miles</li>
    <li>First detected: July 2023</li>
    <li>Detection system: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS has unfolded over several months:</p>
<ul>
    <li>July 2023: 3I/ATLAS is first detected by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>August 6, 2023: Data collected by the Webb Space Telescope contributes to estimating the comet's size.</li>
    <li>October 1-7, 2023: ESA captures images of the comet as it passes near Mars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target,” said Nick Thomas, Principal Investigator of the CaSSIS camera.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is an anomalously massive object,” stated Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, discussing the new size data in a blog post.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event is notable as it represents only the third instance of an interstellar object entering Earth's solar system. The first was the cigar-shaped object "Oumuamua" discovered in 2017, followed by the comet "21/Borisov" in 2019. These discoveries have sparked interest in the study of objects from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from the observations of 3I/ATLAS to gain further insights into its composition and trajectory. No further missions are currently planned specifically for this comet.</p>
