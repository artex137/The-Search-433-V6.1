      <h2>'Dorito' shaped aircraft seen over Area 51 as mysterious transmission plays coded message</h2>

<p>A backpacker has reported capturing a "Dorito" shaped unidentified flying object (UFO) on camera near Area 51 at approximately 3 a.m. on January 14. Anders Otteson, who was camping in the Tikaboo Valley in the Nevada desert, claims that the aircraft flew at a low altitude directly overhead.</p>

<p>This sighting raises questions about the type of aircraft being tested at the highly secretive military facility. Otteson has linked his observation to previous reports of triangle-shaped objects in the region, which have drawn interest from UFO enthusiasts and researchers. The National UFO Reporting Center has noted an increase in sightings of similar aircraft across the United States.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred at approximately 3 a.m. on January 14, 2023.</li>
    <li>Location: Tikaboo Valley, Nevada, near Area 51.</li>
    <li>Prior sighting of a B-2 Spirit bomber occurred around 1 a.m. on the same day.</li>
    <li>National UFO Reporting Center recorded 10 sightings of triangle-shaped objects in January 2023.</li>
    <li>Otteson runs a YouTube channel documenting his experiences.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 14, 2023, Anders Otteson spotted a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber around 1 a.m. while camping near Groom Lake Road. He later observed the "Dorito" shaped aircraft at approximately 3 a.m. Otteson reported the aircraft flying from the northwest and noted its flight path resembled military training sorties.</p>

<p>During his observation, Otteson also captured a transmission on his radio scanner, which included phrases he believes to be coded messages. This transmission included terms such as "pretzel snack" and "Imperial with garlic."</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Are we looking at a classified test flight or run-of-the-mill training sortie?” Otteson asked. “I certainly think we have something interesting here.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has long been a focal point for UFO sightings and speculation, primarily due to its history of developing and testing advanced military aircraft, including the F-117 Nighthawk during the late 1970s and 1980s. The recent increase in reported sightings of triangle-shaped objects has reignited public interest and debate over the facility's activities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for investigating the recent sightings. Otteson's video and claims may prompt further scrutiny from UFO researchers and agencies monitoring aerial phenomena.</p>
