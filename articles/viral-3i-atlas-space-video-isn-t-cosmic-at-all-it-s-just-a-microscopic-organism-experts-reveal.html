      <h2>Viral '3I/ATLAS' Space Video Isn't Cosmic at All — It's Just a Microscopic Organism, Experts Reveal</h2>

<p>A time-lapse video that circulated widely on X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram, claiming to show the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, has been debunked as footage of a paramecium, a single-celled organism. Fact-checkers confirmed the video does not depict the comet, which was first detected on 1 July 2023 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile.</p>

<p>This incident highlights the challenges of distinguishing between genuine scientific imagery and misleading content on social media. Experts caution that not everything that appears cosmic is actually from space, and the mix-up serves as a reminder of the importance of verifying information before sharing.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video went viral on X and Instagram with claims it showed 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Confirmed by fact-checkers as microscopy footage of a paramecium.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected on 1 July 2023 by ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Comet has an unusual carbon dioxide to water ratio.</li>
    <li>Estimated age of 3I/ATLAS is possibly up to 10 billion years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2023, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following this discovery, a time-lapse video claiming to depict the comet surfaced on social media. The video quickly gained traction, attracting thousands of views and likes.</p>
<p>Subsequent analysis by experts revealed that the video was actually footage of a paramecium, debunking the claims that it showed the comet. The side-by-side comparison with authentic images of 3I/ATLAS confirmed the misinformation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The footage does not show the comet,” said a spokesperson for the fact-checking organization involved in the analysis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This serves as a sharp lesson about how scientific imagery can be misinterpreted in the age of social media,” noted a microscopy expert.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is a part of a growing trend where misinformation spreads rapidly online, particularly regarding scientific topics. Media analysts emphasize the importance of verifying the source of scientific imagery and claims before sharing them. The viral nature of the video underscores the potential for confusion when scientific information is taken out of context.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts continue to stress the need for public education on verifying scientific claims online. They recommend that viewers check the credibility of sources and use fact-checking resources to combat misinformation. The scientific community will likely continue monitoring the discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS as it remains a significant interstellar comet.</p>
