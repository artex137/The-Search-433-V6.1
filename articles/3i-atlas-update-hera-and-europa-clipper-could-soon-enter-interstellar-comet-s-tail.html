      <h2>3I/ATLAS update: Hera and Europa Clipper could soon enter interstellar comet's tail</h2>

<p>NASA's Hera and Europa Clipper missions are poised to enter the tail of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, according to agency reports. The two spacecraft, launched to study asteroids and moons, may soon encounter this unique celestial phenomenon.</p>

<p>This development is significant for scientists studying the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. NASA has indicated that the data collected during this encounter could provide insights into the early solar system and the materials that formed it. The agency continues to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS as the missions approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently on a trajectory that allows for close encounters with spacecraft.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hera and Europa Clipper missions are equipped to study celestial phenomena.</li>
    <li>The precise timing of the spacecraft's entry into the comet's tail is not disclosed.</li>
    <li>This encounter could yield valuable scientific data regarding interstellar materials.</li>
    <li>NASA's ongoing monitoring efforts ensure the safety and success of the missions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2019 and has since been tracked as it moves through the solar system. NASA launched the Hera and Europa Clipper missions to study various aspects of asteroids and moons, respectively, and now both spacecraft are on a path toward the comet's tail.</p>
<p>As the missions approach, NASA continues to update the public on their progress and any potential scientific findings resulting from this unique encounter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The data collected during this encounter could provide insights into the early solar system,” a NASA spokesperson said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of the few interstellar comets observed in our solar system. Previous studies of such objects have helped scientists understand the origins of our solar system and the materials present during its formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and prepare for the imminent encounter, with updates expected as the spacecraft draw closer to the comet's tail.</p>
