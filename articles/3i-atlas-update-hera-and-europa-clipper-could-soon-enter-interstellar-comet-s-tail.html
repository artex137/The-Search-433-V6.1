      <h2>3I/ATLAS update: Hera and Europa Clipper could soon enter interstellar comet's tail</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper and the European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft are set to approach interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, with opportunities to enter its tail between October 25 and November 6, 2023. The comet, which flew by Mars earlier this month, is expected to reach perihelion on October 29.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it will provide scientists with a chance to gather data on 3I/ATLAS, which has shown several anomalies since its discovery on July 1, 2023. The upcoming observations could help unravel some of the mysteries surrounding this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Hera will enter the comet's ion tail between October 25 and November 1.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper is scheduled to encounter the comet between October 30 and November 6.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's JUICE will also monitor the comet in November.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS flew by Mars in early October 2023.</li>
    <li>Data from Hera and Europa Clipper could be published in Research Notes of the AAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023. It made a close flyby of Mars in early October, providing an opportunity for observation from orbiters around the planet. As it approaches the Sun, it is expected to be at peak activity on October 29.</p>
<p>Starting from October 25, Hera will begin its approach to the comet's tail, followed closely by Europa Clipper, which will reach the comet between October 30 and November 6.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Europa Clipper has a rare opportunity to sample an interstellar object’s tail,” the authors noted in their paper.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the first interstellar comet observed since its discovery. Prior observations have raised questions about its composition and behaviour. The upcoming encounters with Hera and Europa Clipper are expected to provide critical data that has eluded telescopes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Hera and Europa Clipper will collect data on 3I/ATLAS, with findings anticipated in the months following their encounters. The European Space Agency's JUICE will also begin monitoring the comet in November, relaying information by February 2024.</p>
