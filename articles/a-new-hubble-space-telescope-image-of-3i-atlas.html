      <h2>A New Hubble Space Telescope Image of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured a new image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from a distance of 286 million kilometers on November 30, 2025. The image reveals a teardrop-shaped halo around the comet, which was taken after its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>This image is significant as it provides new insights into the comet's behavior and composition. Scientists are particularly interested in the glowing halo and the anti-tail extension that appears to point toward the Sun. This observation may help researchers understand the physical processes affecting interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: November 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 286 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Radius of the glow: approximately 40,000 kilometers</li>
    <li>Length of the anti-tail extension: about 60,000 kilometers</li>
    <li>Previous image taken: July 21, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, Hubble captured a pre-perihelion image of 3I/ATLAS, showing its approach to the Sun. The comet was at a distance 56% larger than its position on November 30. Following its closest approach, the latest image was taken to observe changes in its structure.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb, in a recent paper, suggested that the teardrop shape of the coma is linked to non-volatile objects that separated from 3I/ATLAS due to its non-gravitational acceleration away from the Sun. This theory aligns with the observations made in the new Hubble image.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The swarm of objects would be closer to the Sun than 3I/ATLAS by about 60,000 kilometers if the objects overlapped with 3I/ATLAS at perihelion,” said Avi Loeb, regarding the implications of the new observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This recent imaging of 3I/ATLAS follows a growing interest in interstellar objects since the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. The study of such comets can provide valuable information about the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers await the release of the full Hubble data set, which will include ultraviolet spectroscopy aimed at determining the composition of the gas plume surrounding 3I/ATLAS. Meanwhile, amateur astronomers continue to document the comet with large-scale images.</p>
