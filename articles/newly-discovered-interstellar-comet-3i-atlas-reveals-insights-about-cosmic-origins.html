      <h2>Newly Discovered Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Reveals Insights About Cosmic Origins</h2>

<p>On July 1, 2025, the Deep Random Survey remote telescope in Chile detected a new comet named 3I/ATLAS, the largest and brightest known interstellar object to enter our solar system. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar comets, and researchers worldwide are studying its composition. NASA's SPHEREx space observatory is among the instruments being used, revealing large amounts of carbon dioxide gas and water ice surrounding the comet. These results enhance scientists' understanding of how interstellar comets compare to those formed within our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date detected: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of detection: Deep Random Survey telescope, Chile</li>
    <li>Significance: Largest and brightest known interstellar object</li>
    <li>Instruments used: NASA's SPHEREx space observatory</li>
    <li>Notable findings: Presence of carbon dioxide and water ice</li>
    <li>Upcoming event: Perihelion in late October 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the Deep Random Survey telescope in Chile first detected 3I/ATLAS. Following this discovery, researchers began employing various instruments, including NASA's SPHEREx, to analyze the comet's composition. Initial findings indicated the presence of carbon dioxide gas and water ice.</p>

<p>As SPHEREx continues observations, it will monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion in late October, where it will be at a distance from the sun similar to that of Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of substantial carbon dioxide vapor around 3I/ATLAS suggests that the comet could resemble typical comets found in our solar system,” said Carey Lisse, an astronomer from Johns Hopkins University and a member of the SPHEREx science team.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“By mapping the universe in 102 colors, SPHEREx can assist in studying a wide array of objects, from distant galaxies to nearby stars and interstellar comets,” stated Olivier Doré, the SPHEREx project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins a select group of interstellar comets, with only two others previously identified. The study of such celestial bodies offers insights into the formation and evolution of the Milky Way, as well as the conditions that lead to comet formation in different solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As SPHEREx continues its observations, scientists plan to release a more comprehensive analysis of 3I/ATLAS in the near future, further enhancing the understanding of this interstellar visitor.</p>
