      <h2>'Mad UFO-lunatic' Vice President JD Vance says aliens could be 'angels or demons'</h2>

<p>Vice President JD Vance has stated that he considers the possibility that aliens could be "angels or demons" during an appearance on the Pod Force One podcast. The remarks, made on an unspecified date, highlight Vance's fascination with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and the existence of otherworldly phenomena.</p>

<p>Vance's comments reflect a growing interest in UFOs among some government officials. He noted that he has discussed the topic with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, indicating that the intrigue surrounding UFOs is shared among certain members of the U.S. government. Authorities continue to investigate claims regarding unidentified aerial phenomena, although the U.S. Government maintains that there is no direct evidence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>JD Vance is 41 years old.</li>
    <li>Vance has expressed his fascination with UFOs multiple times, including on another podcast in August.</li>
    <li>Claims of whistleblowers include the U.S. Government retrieving crashed UFOs and alien remains.</li>
    <li>The U.S. Government denies having direct evidence of extraterrestrial life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2023, JD Vance revealed on a podcast that he was "obsessed with the whole UFO thing" and questioned the nature of recent UFO sightings. Since then, he has continued to discuss the subject, including his views on the spiritual implications of aliens.</p>
<p>Vance has indicated that he has not yet had time to fully explore the topic due to his busy schedule as Vice President.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’m a big believer that there are things out there that we can’t explain. And so if another person sees an alien maybe I see an angel or a demon,” Vance said on the podcast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What I try to do is I try to say my prayers. I try to be as good of a person as I can be and I try to do a good job. And, hopefully that’s all I need to do,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Vance's remarks are part of a broader conversation about UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena, which have gained attention in recent years. Whistleblowers have alleged that the U.S. Government has engaged in reverse-engineering technology from crashed UFOs. However, these claims remain unverified, and officials have consistently stated that there is no conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena continue, as authorities seek to address claims made by whistleblowers and gather more information on the subject. Vance has indicated a desire to further explore the topic when his schedule allows.</p>
