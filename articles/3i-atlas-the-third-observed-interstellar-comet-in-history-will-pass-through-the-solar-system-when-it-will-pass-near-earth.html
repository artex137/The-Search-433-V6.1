      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-01 10:49 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS, the third observed interstellar comet in history, will pass through the Solar System</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has become the third interstellar comet recorded, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. It reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023, at 1.35 astronomical units (approximately 202 million kilometers), as it began its transit through perihelion, where it experiences extreme temperature changes that cause ice to sublimate and form a tail of dust and gas.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS travels at 60 km per second (210,000 km/h), the highest speed recorded for an object passing through the Solar System. The comet's unique trajectory means it will not return to the Solar System, making this passage a one-time opportunity for scientific observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS Telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Reached perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Travels at 60 km/s (210,000 km/h), the highest speed recorded for a Solar System object.</li>
    <li>Will approach Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometers in early December 2023.</li>
    <li>Estimated age of 3I/ATLAS is 7 billion years, twice the age of Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are collaborating on the research.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers at the ATLAS Telescope in Chile detected the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023, experiencing significant temperature changes as it passed through perihelion. The perihelion event will conclude on October 31, 2023, before the comet continues its journey through interstellar space. In early December 2023, 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS represents an astronomical milestone that allows science to explore the limits of the Solar System,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “Each comet that visits us from other stars is a time capsule, and its study brings us a little closer to understanding our place in the cosmos.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the previous interstellar comets, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have contributed to the understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics. The collaboration between NASA and ESA for this research highlights the importance of international cooperation in advancing scientific knowledge about celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its perihelion passage, researchers will continue to collect data from ground-based telescopes in December 2023 as 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth. This research aims to further explore its composition and behavior, enhancing understanding of interstellar matter and the origins of water and life in the universe.</p>
