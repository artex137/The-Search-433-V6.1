      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS Heading Toward Earth? UN Launches Planetary Defence Campaign Amid Global Alarm</h2>

<p>The arrival of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) has prompted the United Nations to mobilise a global planetary-defence initiative, despite NASA confirming it poses no danger to Earth. The comet is set to pass at a distance of about 270 million kilometres from Earth on 30 October 2025, sparking public interest in near-Earth threats and testing global preparedness for such cosmic events.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it marks the first UN-backed observational campaign for an interstellar object, led by the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) under the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA). Authorities aim to improve worldwide preparedness and data-sharing in response to potential cosmic threats, especially as many countries lack robust monitoring infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> 30 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometres (1.8 astronomical units)</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Beyond the Solar System</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Activity:</strong> Dust and gas-filled coma with a faint tail</li>
    <li><strong>International Campaign:</strong> Led by the IAWN and UNOOSA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Subsequent tracking confirmed its hyperbolic orbit and high velocity, indicating its interstellar origin. NASA reported that the comet will reach its perihelion on 30 October 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have confirmed comet-like activity, including a gas coma dominated by carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We shouldn't wait for a dangerous object to learn how we'll respond—that would be too late,” said an official at the Planetary Defence Coordination Office.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The collection and analysis of near-Earth object data is a matter of global common interest,” stated the European Space Agency during a briefing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS is notable as it highlights the need for international cooperation in planetary defence. Many nations, particularly in the Global South, lack the necessary infrastructure to monitor and respond to cosmic threats. The planned International Year of Asteroid Awareness and Planetary Defence in 2029 aims to engage various stakeholders, including amateur astronomers and national emergency agencies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories worldwide are preparing to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and continues on its exit path. Key milestones include the perihelion date in October 2025, with further monitoring expected in December 2025 and early 2026. Scientists will remain vigilant for any unusual activity that could challenge current models of comet dynamics.</p>
