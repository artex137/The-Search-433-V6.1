      <h2>American Airlines Pilot Confirms UFO Sightings Threatening Planes</h2>

<p>Captain Steve, an American Airlines pilot with 426,000 TikTok followers, has revealed unsettling details about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and drones that pose risks to aviation safety. In a recent Q&A session, he discussed these threats while flying over various regions, particularly mentioning the Canadian Maritimes. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these incidents.</p>

<p>This information is significant as it highlights growing concerns about the safety of commercial air travel. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reported a rise in near-midair collisions involving drones, prompting regulatory agencies to implement strict penalties for violations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>64% of near-midair collisions in 2024 involved unmanned aerial systems.</li>
    <li>The FAA receives approximately 100 safety reports monthly regarding drones near commercial aircraft.</li>
    <li>A flight crew in November 2024 spotted a drone 300 feet from their cockpit.</li>
    <li>A Newark pilot reported a drone within 50 feet of their aircraft earlier in 2024.</li>
    <li>Fines for reckless drone use can reach £60,000 ($75,000) per violation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2024, a flight crew approaching San Francisco encountered a drone just 300 feet from their cockpit. Earlier that year, a Newark pilot reported a similar close call with a drone flying within 50 feet of their wing. Captain Steve's revelations have surfaced amid increasing reports of drone-related incidents affecting aviation safety.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’ve seen drones go by before. That’s disturbing,” Captain Steve said during his TikTok session. “The threat of drones is not merely hypothetical.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It causes them to light up and not light up. So sometimes it can look they’re moving around but they’re not. They’re actually stationary,” he explained, referring to Starlink satellites.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) sightings have become common, with many reports attributed to low-orbit satellite constellations like Starlink. These satellites can create visual phenomena that confuse pilots. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has confirmed that many recent sightings are misidentified satellites.</p>

<p>The challenges posed by drones and satellite phenomena underscore the complexities pilots face in maintaining safety in increasingly crowded airspace.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Regulatory agencies continue to monitor drone activity closely and enforce strict penalties for violations. Investigations into specific incidents are ongoing, and further measures may be implemented to enhance aviation safety.</p>
