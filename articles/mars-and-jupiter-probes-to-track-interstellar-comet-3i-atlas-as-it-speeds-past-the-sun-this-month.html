      <h2>Mars and Jupiter Probes to Track Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS as it Speeds Past the Sun This Month</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA have mobilized their Mars and Jupiter mission spacecraft to observe interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun in October 2025. The comet, which was first detected in July 2025 by an ATLAS telescope in Chile, is the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system and is traveling at a velocity of approximately 130,000 mph (219,000 km/h).</p>

<p>This collaboration is significant as it allows scientists to gather real-time data on the comet's behavior and composition. The unique trajectory of 3I/ATLAS, which does not conform to a closed orbit around the sun, provides a rare opportunity to study the properties of interstellar comets as they interact with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2025 by an ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at approximately 130,000 mph (219,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will observe the comet on October 3, 2025, when it is 30 million km from Mars.</li>
    <li>NASA's Psyche mission will also capture observations of the comet during its journey.</li>
    <li>ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will focus on 3I/ATLAS from November 2 to 25, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. Since then, preparations have been underway for various spacecraft to observe its passage through the solar system. On October 3, 2025, ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will conduct observations as the comet approaches Mars at a distance of 30 million km. Following this, from November 2 to 25, 2025, ESA's Juice mission will focus its instruments on the comet after it reaches perihelion, its closest point to the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>T. Marshall Eubanks, Chief Scientist at Space Initiatives Inc, stated, "Juice’s data during this phase is expected to be highly significant."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS is rare and provides a unique opportunity for the astronomy community. Previous studies of such comets have contributed to understanding the building blocks of planetary systems and the potential for universal components across different star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, ESA and NASA will continue to monitor the comet closely. The data collected during this period is expected to yield valuable insights into its chemical composition and activity, furthering the understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
