      <h2>Two green comets shine bright in Northern Hemisphere skies</h2>

<p>Two bright green comets, Comet Lemmon and Comet SWAN, are currently visible to skygazers in the Northern Hemisphere. Comet Lemmon is expected to have its closest approach to Earth on or around Tuesday, while Comet SWAN will fly by on Monday, although it is moving away from the sun and may become dimmer in the coming days.</p>

<p>This rare event allows for the simultaneous visibility of two comets without special equipment, a phenomenon that is “rare, but not unprecedented,” according to Carson Fuls, director of the University of Arizona-based sky survey that discovered Comet Lemmon. Observers can look for Comet Lemmon just after sunset in the northern sky, while Comet SWAN will be located to the southwest.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Lemmon</strong> (C/2025 A6) closest approach: Tuesday</li>
    <li><strong>Comet SWAN</strong> (C/2025 R2) closest approach: Monday</li>
    <li>Visibility: Both comets may be seen with binoculars through the end of the month</li>
    <li>Comet Lemmon discovered: January 2025</li>
    <li>Comet SWAN discovered: September 2025</li>
    <li>Current location: Comet Lemmon in northern sky; Comet SWAN in southwestern sky</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon was discovered in January 2025 by a telescope searching for near-Earth asteroids. Comet SWAN, on the other hand, was spotted in September 2025 by an amateur astronomer using images from a NASA and European Space Agency spacecraft.</p>

<p>Both comets are now approaching Earth and are expected to provide a viewing opportunity for astronomy enthusiasts in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Spotting two comets simultaneously without special equipment is rare, but not unprecedented,” said Carson Fuls, director of the University of Arizona-based sky survey.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The double comets could be visible with binoculars through the end of the month, but experts aren't yet sure how bright they'll remain,” stated Valerie Rapson, astronomer at the State University of New York at Oneonta.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are remnants from the solar system’s formation billions of years ago. They become visible as they approach the sun, releasing gases that create their characteristic tails. Earlier this year, a different green comet broke apart near the sun, disappointing skygazers hoping for a spectacular display.</p>

<p>Notable recent comets include Tsuchinshan-Atlas in 2024 and Neowise in 2020, with historic comets such as Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake capturing public interest in the 1990s.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers are encouraged to look for the comets in the night sky as they approach Earth. Further observations will determine how bright they remain as they continue their paths away from the sun.</p>
