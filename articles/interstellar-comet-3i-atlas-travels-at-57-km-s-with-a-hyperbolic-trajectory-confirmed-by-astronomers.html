      <p class="byline">Published 2026-01-06 04:33 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas travels at 57 km/s with a hyperbolic trajectory confirmed by astronomers</h2>

<p>The astronomical community has confirmed the passage of comet 3I/Atlas, the third interstellar object detected in our Solar System, traveling at a speed of 57 kilometers per second. This hyperbolic trajectory ensures that the comet will not be captured by the Sun's gravity and will return to deep space after its close approach.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it places 3I/Atlas among previous interstellar visitors, including ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet Borisov in 2019. It offers scientists a rare opportunity to study primordial material from another star system without launching a space probe. Detailed observations have confirmed its external origin, as its trajectory is incompatible with any point of origin within the Sun’s gravitational influence, which extends up to 3.8 light-years.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas travels at 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>Detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>It will follow a single-pass route before returning to deep space.</li>
    <li>Its trajectory confirms it does not originate from the Oort Cloud or Kuiper Belt.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object detected, alongside ‘Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was detected recently by the ATLAS program in Hawaii. This detection has allowed astronomers to observe its hyperbolic trajectory as it approaches the Solar System. The comet’s speed and trajectory have been analyzed through ongoing observations, which will continue as it travels back into interstellar space.</p>

<p>Initial observations indicate that 3I/Atlas has enough kinetic energy to escape the Sun’s gravitational pull, maintaining a trajectory that suggests it has traveled from a distant star system. Its approach marks a significant moment for astronomers studying interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The speed of 57 km/s recorded for 3I/Atlas reinforces its extrasolar origin and provides clues about the star system from which it was ejected,” said an astronomer involved in the observations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/Atlas, ‘Oumuamua and comet Borisov were the only confirmed interstellar objects to have passed through our Solar System. The detection of these objects has opened new avenues for research into the composition and dynamics of other planetary systems. Astronomers continue to study these visitors to understand their origins and the conditions of their home star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing analysis of comet 3I/Atlas will focus on its composition through spectroscopic studies, which will help confirm its classification as an interstellar object. Observations will continue to refine its trajectory and provide insight into the characteristics of the star system from which it originated.</p>
