      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Japan’s XRISM Probe Captures X-ray Emission From Exocomet Ahead Of Earth Flyby</h2>

<p>Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)’s X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) has captured X-ray emissions from the comet 3I/ATLAS during observations conducted from November 26 to November 28, 2025. The findings reveal a faint X-ray glow around the comet, located approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insights into the comet's composition and behavior. XRISM has identified X-ray emissions likely associated with carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, suggesting interactions between the comet's gas and the solar wind. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, is the third interstellar visitor to enter the solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observations conducted by XRISM from November 26, 2025, at 23:20 to November 28, 2025, at 20:38.</li>
    <li>Total effective exposure time was 17 hours.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is located approximately 270 million kilometers (1.78 astronomical units) from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet's perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>First observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors include 1I/Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Observations by XRISM took place from November 26 to November 28, 2025. The comet's perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, marking a significant event in its trajectory through the solar system.</p>

<p>The preliminary analysis of the data collected during the XRISM observations revealed a faint X-ray glow extending around the comet, indicating interactions between the comet's gas and solar wind.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“XRISM describes further in the study X-ray components likely associated with carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen appear in ways that cannot be explained by ordinary background emission,” JAXA stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Our early data hint at a faint X-ray glow spreading hundreds of thousands of kilometers across its coma—a first glimpse of this rare visitor from beyond the Solar System,” XRISM tweeted on December 6, 2025.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest among scientists and space agencies, including NASA, ESA, and ISRO. This comet is noted for its anomalous behavior, with at least 13 identified anomalies reported by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. These peculiarities have sparked various theories, including speculation regarding the comet being an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>Despite these theories, the comet has displayed typical cometary behavior, further emphasizing the need for continued observation and study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Space agencies will continue to monitor the comet, analyzing data to better understand its characteristics and the implications of its interactions with the solar wind.</p>
