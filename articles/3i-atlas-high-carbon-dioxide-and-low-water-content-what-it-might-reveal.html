      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Reveals High Carbon Dioxide and Low Water Content</h2>

<p>Researchers have discovered that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS possesses a high carbon-dioxide-to-water ratio as it travels through the solar system. The comet was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Observations have been conducted using the James Webb Space Telescope, with results indicating unique chemical properties that could shed light on its origins.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may provide insights into the formation of comets and their composition. Researchers from NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and various universities are studying the comet before it exits the solar system in a matter of months. The findings could help explain the conditions under which 3I/ATLAS formed in its protoplanetary disk.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Interstellar, from outside our solar system</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 130,000 mph (209,215 km/h)</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Tools:</strong> James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble, SPHEREx</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Deadline:</strong> September 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, during a survey by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its identification, researchers began using advanced telescopes to study its composition and trajectory. The comet's high speed and unique properties prompted immediate scientific interest, leading to ongoing observations using the James Webb Space Telescope and other instruments.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches the Sun, it is expected to undergo significant changes, which will limit the time researchers have to analyze its characteristics. Observations will continue until September 2025, after which the comet will be too close to the Sun for effective study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The high carbon-dioxide-to-water ratio is the highest ever recorded in a comet, which could tell us more about 3I/ATLAS's formation and its journey through the solar system,” said a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following previous discoveries that have sparked interest in the composition and origins of such objects. The study of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS could inform scientists about the conditions in other solar systems and the processes that lead to the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS until September 2025, aiming to gather as much data as possible before the comet exits the solar system. Future studies may focus on analyzing the collected data to better understand the comet's origins and the implications for planetary formation.</p>
