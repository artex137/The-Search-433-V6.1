      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS of interstellar origin is monitored by the UN warning network without risk to Earth</h2>

<p>The Rede Internacional de Alerta de Asteroides (IAWN) has been monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile. The comet, which follows a hyperbolic trajectory, will reach its closest proximity to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers. There are no reported risks of collision, according to experts from NASA and the IAWN network.</p>

<p>This monitoring is significant as it marks the first time the IAWN has tracked an interstellar object since its establishment in 2017. The ongoing campaign, which began on November 27, 2025, and will continue until January 27, 2026, aims to enhance astrometry techniques for tracking diffuse celestial bodies like comets. The data collected will contribute to future studies and improve the accuracy of trajectory predictions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Period:</strong> November 27, 2025 - January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Age Estimate:</strong> More than 7 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Eight times more carbon dioxide than water</li>
    <li><strong>Number of Participating Observatories:</strong> Over 80</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, with signs of cometary activity detected as early as May. The comet reached perihelion in October 2025, coming within 210 million kilometers of the Sun. Observations from various telescopes, including Gemini North in Hawaii, have documented changes in brightness and cryovolcanic activity. The monitoring campaign by IAWN commenced on November 27, 2025, halfway through its planned duration, and will conclude on January 27, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This exercise is unprecedented as it involves an interstellar object,” said James Bauer, principal investigator. “The campaign allows us to refine our techniques for measuring the positions of comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to be tracked, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit and high velocity indicate it was ejected from another star system billions of years ago. The ongoing monitoring of such comets enhances the ability of astronomers to predict the paths of future interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Data collected during the campaign will be analyzed for publication in scientific journals in 2026. This research will improve methods for tracking near-Earth objects (NEOs) and long-period comets, contributing to future space missions targeting similar celestial bodies.</p>
