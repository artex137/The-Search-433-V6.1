      <h2>Fresh 3I/ATLAS images from Mars add fuel to alien spacecraft theories</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS taken from Mars have sparked renewed speculation about its potential as an alien spacecraft. NASA’s Perseverance rover captured the images, which show a bright, cylindrical object moving across the Martian sky.</p>

<p>This development matters because it has reignited interest in the theories proposed by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who has long suggested that 3I/ATLAS may be an extraterrestrial probe. Despite the excitement, Loeb has provided a scientific explanation for the appearance of the object, attributing it to the rover’s camera system. Meanwhile, speculation among the public has intensified.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images captured by NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars.</li>
    <li>Object identified as 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Loeb states images were likely affected by camera exposure stacking.</li>
    <li>Dr. Horace Drew suggests green glow may indicate nickel coating.</li>
    <li>Nasa maintains 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA’s Perseverance rover captured images of 3I/ATLAS in recent weeks. The object has been the subject of speculation since its discovery, with various theories about its nature emerging from both scientists and social media users.</p>

<p>Loeb has previously suggested that 3I/ATLAS could have sent a message to Earth decades ago. He expressed excitement over the potential for upcoming high-resolution images from Mars’ HiRISE camera, which may provide further insight into the object.</p>

<p>Just weeks prior to the new images, 3I/ATLAS survived a violent solar eruption, prompting further discussion about its durability and possible artificial origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The elongated ship-like shape was likely caused by the rover’s camera system stacking hundreds of exposures over roughly ten minutes,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The green coma is made of nickel. Aliens may coat their spacecraft with nickel, just as we coat ours,” claimed Dr. Horace Drew.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent images of 3I/ATLAS come amid a broader context of scientific inquiry into potential extraterrestrial life. NASA has also reported potential evidence of ancient life on Mars, further fueling public interest in the topic. The agency has consistently maintained that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet.</p>

<p>Additionally, NASA has proposed launching nukes at a “city killer” asteroid, which some interpret as preparation for potential interstellar threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to release more high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS from the HiRISE camera, which may help clarify the nature of the object and address ongoing speculation. The debate surrounding the object’s origins and implications continues to attract attention from both scientists and the public.</p>
