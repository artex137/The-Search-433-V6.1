      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth this Friday. Here’s what to know.</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on Friday, March 15, 2024. The comet is currently traveling through the solar system and is expected to come within approximately 0.5 astronomical units (AU) of Earth, equating to about 74 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers and space enthusiasts, as it provides a rare opportunity to observe an interstellar object up close. NASA and other space agencies have mobilized resources to monitor and study the comet's trajectory and characteristics as it approaches.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> March 15, 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 0.5 AU (74 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> 2019</li>
    <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Monitored by NASA and other space agencies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2019, marking it as an interstellar comet. Since then, it has traveled through the solar system, gaining attention from astronomers worldwide.</p>
<p>As it approaches Earth, NASA and other agencies have increased their observational efforts to gather data on its composition and path.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a unique opportunity to study an interstellar object,” said Dr. Jane Smith, an astronomer at NASA. “We are excited to see what data we can collect.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, with only a few identified since the first confirmed interstellar object, 'Oumuamua', was detected in 2017. The study of such comets can provide insights into the formation of solar systems and the materials that exist outside our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, astronomers will continue to track its trajectory and gather data, with additional observations planned for the days surrounding its closest approach.</p>
