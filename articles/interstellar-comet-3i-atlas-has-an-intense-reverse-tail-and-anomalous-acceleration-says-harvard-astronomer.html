      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has an intense reverse tail and anomalous acceleration, says Harvard astronomer</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, an astronomer from Universidade of Essa, has reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits intense activity, including a notable antitail directed toward Sol. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units from Sol.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS may not conform to traditional models of comet behavior. Authorities, including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), are closely monitoring the comet's unusual characteristics, which include significant non-gravitational acceleration and high rates of mass loss.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Sol at perihelion: 1.36 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration: 135 km/day² radially and 60 km/day² transversally</li>
    <li>Estimated mass loss: 50 billion tons per month</li>
    <li>Diameter of coma: 5 arc minutes</li>
    <li>Length of main tail: up to 900 arc seconds</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Terra: December 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, prompting studies into its unique features. Observations on November 22 revealed a coma diameter of 5 arc minutes. By November 23, images showed the main tail extending to 500 arc seconds, indicating multiple jets with varying ejection directions. Further analysis on November 24 confirmed the presence of an antitail directed solarward, suggesting significant ejection of material.</p>

<p>Throughout November, astronomers utilized the MeerKAT network to detect radio signals from 3I/ATLAS, confirming its natural origin. Observations continued to reveal anomalies, including persistent sunward jets and deviations from expected orbital paths.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The combination of features sets 3I/ATLAS apart from previous visitors,” Loeb stated, emphasizing the comet's unique characteristics compared to 1I/’Oumuamua, which lacked a visible coma.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The intensity indicates a volume of ejected material that defies traditional comet simulations,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects like 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have shown different behaviors. 1I/’Oumuamua exhibited acceleration without a detectable coma or tail, while 2I/Borisov behaved like a classic comet. The unusual properties of 3I/ATLAS challenge existing models of cometary behavior and suggest new avenues for research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations are planned, including analyses by the Webb Telescope in December 2025, to study the chemical composition of the jets. Ground-based telescopes, such as the Rubin Observatory, will also focus on 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>
