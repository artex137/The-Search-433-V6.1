      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery: CIA Refuses to Confirm Existence of Records on Interstellar 'Alien Tech' Candidate</h2>

<p>The CIA has issued a 'Glomar' response regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, stating it can "neither confirm nor deny" the existence of related records. The announcement followed a Freedom of Information Act request by John Greenewald Jr. of The Black Vault. Spotted last year by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the solar system.</p>

<p>This situation has sparked significant debate about national security and the implications of potential extraterrestrial technology. The object has arrived during a time of international instability, prompting authorities to reconsider how global defense strategies are structured. NASA and the European Space Agency have stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no physical threat to Earth, but its discovery has initiated a planetary defense exercise involving over 170 participants from 80 observatories worldwide, scheduled to run through late January 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object travels at 58 kilometers per second on a hyperbolic path.</li>
    <li>It is estimated to be an 11-billion-year-old remnant from the Milky Way's early days.</li>
    <li>The CIA's response to a FOIA request was issued on January 5, 2026.</li>
    <li>The planetary defense exercise involves 170 participants from 80 observatories.</li>
    <li>The exercise is under the United Nations and the International Asteroid Warning Network.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is scheduled for a final planetary assist in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was spotted by NASA's ATLAS in Chile on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, a significant mobilization of scientific resources occurred, reflecting the urgency of the situation. On January 5, 2026, the CIA responded to a FOIA request with a statement that it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of records related to the object, a response typically reserved for classified military assets.</p>
<p>As of January 2026, a planetary defense exercise has been initiated, involving collaboration among global observatories to refine the object's orbit and study its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object is a reminder that security is not just terrestrial,” a senior official noted during a recent briefing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the earlier observations of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which have raised questions about the origins of interstellar objects. The ongoing debate includes concerns about the potential for militarization of astronomical research as nations seek to understand and respond to these cosmic visitors.</p>
<p>Critics have expressed worries about a technology race that could arise if 3I/ATLAS is indeed a remnant of advanced extraterrestrial technology. Meanwhile, proponents argue that the object could foster international collaboration, as space agencies continue to share real-time data amid geopolitical tensions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The planetary defense exercise is set to continue through late January 2026. The scientific community will monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, with a final assist scheduled for March 2026 before it disappears into space. Authorities will likely remain vigilant regarding the implications of this interstellar visitor.</p>
