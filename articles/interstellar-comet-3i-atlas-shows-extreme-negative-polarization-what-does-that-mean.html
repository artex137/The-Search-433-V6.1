      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Shows “Extreme Negative Polarization”</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which entered the Solar System on July 1, 2025. This comet has exhibited extreme negative polarization characteristics, which challenge existing comet classification systems. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it raises fundamental questions about the composition and origin of the comet. Research teams have observed that 3I/ATLAS does not fit into any known category of comets, prompting scientists to consider the implications for our understanding of cometary bodies. Astronomers are conducting further observations to confirm these findings and explore the comet's unique properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The nucleus measures approximately 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>Estimated mass exceeds 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Measurements revealed Pmin values of −2.77 ± 0.11%.</li>
    <li>Current observations are limited; the comet will not be visible again until later in 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS appeared in the Solar System, exhibiting polarimetric characteristics that were unprecedented among known comets. Initial measurements indicated a significant negative polarization pattern. As the comet approached the Sun, its outgassing behavior confirmed its classification as a comet rather than an asteroid.</p>
<p>Research teams have since conducted extensive polarimetric observations, identifying parameters that distinguish 3I/ATLAS from previously observed comets. These findings have been documented in a paper submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters, which is currently under peer review.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The unique polarimetric behavior of 3I/ATLAS suggests that our understanding of cometary composition and structure requires revision,” said Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, providing context for the research findings.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, interstellar comets such as ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov had been observed, but none exhibited the extreme negative polarization observed in 3I/ATLAS. This finding highlights the diversity of interstellar bodies and suggests that more complex structures may exist within our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue observations of 3I/ATLAS when it becomes visible again later in 2025. These future observations will be crucial for validating the extreme negative polarization measurements and understanding the implications of this comet's unique characteristics.</p>
