      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS grows more active in new NASA, ESA images ahead of close Earth encounter</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is gaining attention as it heads away from our solar system, with its closest approach to Earth set for December 19, when it will be approximately 170 million miles away. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have released new images showing increased activity in the comet following its recent solar encounter.</p>

<p>This comet, discovered in late June and confirmed as the third known interstellar object in July, has been travelling through the inner solar system at about 209,000 km/h. The increased brightness observed in recent images is attributed to the warming of internal ice, which sublimates as the comet nears the sun, creating a visible coma and tail.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in late June 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured an image on December 4 from approximately 287 million km away.</li>
    <li>Earlier images estimated the comet's size between 427 meters and 1.1 km.</li>
    <li>ESA's Juice mission observed the comet from 66 million km away on November 2.</li>
    <li>More than a dozen spacecraft have tracked 3I/ATLAS, including rovers and solar orbiters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in late June 2023. It was confirmed as an interstellar object in July. The comet made close passes of Mars and the sun in October 2023. On November 2, ESA's Juice mission observed the comet, and NASA's Hubble captured an image of it on December 4. The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every measurement helps answer new questions about its size, behaviour and composition,” NASA and ESA stated regarding the importance of observing 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following the detection of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The interest in these objects stems from their potential to provide insights into the conditions of other solar systems and the origins of our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with the final observations expected to yield valuable data before the comet disappears back into deep space.</p>
