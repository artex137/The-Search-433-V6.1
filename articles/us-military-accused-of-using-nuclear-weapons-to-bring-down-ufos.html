      <h2>US military accused of using nuclear weapons to bring down UFOs</h2>

<p>The US military has been accused of using nuclear weapons to shoot down unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and retrieve their technology, according to filmmaker Dan Farah. Farah made these claims during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast on November 24, 2025. He stated that he spent four years interviewing high-ranking members of the US government and military regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This matter raises significant questions about the military's actions in relation to unidentified aerial phenomena. Authorities are now facing scrutiny over these allegations, which suggest a covert history of nuclear testing linked to UFO incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Accusations made by filmmaker Dan Farah.</li>
    <li>Claims involve the use of nuclear weapons to disable UFOs.</li>
    <li>Farah conducted interviews over four years with unnamed military sources.</li>
    <li>Statements made during the Joe Rogan Experience podcast on November 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Claims relate to nuclear testing conducted in the 1950s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the 1950s, the US conducted nuclear tests, which Farah claims were sometimes aimed at disabling alien crafts. On November 24, 2025, Farah shared these allegations during his podcast appearance, detailing his four-year investigation into the matter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I learned from sources responsible for the retrieval of these UFOs that nuclear testing was often done to secretly disable alien craft,” said Farah during the podcast.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time allegations have surfaced regarding government involvement with UFOs. Past incidents have raised concerns about transparency and the military's handling of unidentified aerial phenomena. The claims made by Farah add to a growing body of evidence that suggests a long-standing interest in extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities may need to address these allegations as public interest grows. Investigations into the claims have not been disclosed, and it remains unclear what steps, if any, will be taken in response to Farah's statements.</p>
