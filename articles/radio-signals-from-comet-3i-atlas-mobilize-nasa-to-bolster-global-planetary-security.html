      <h2>Radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS mobilize NASA to bolster global planetary security</h2>

<p>The international scientific community has mobilized following the detection of unusual radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object identified crossing Earth's solar system. The signals were detected on October 24, 2023, by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</p>

<p>This discovery has prompted NASA to intensify its planetary defense protocols. The agency is investigating the origins and nature of the comet, which is traveling at over 100,000 kilometers per hour. The signals, captured at a frequency of 1.6 GHz, differ from known natural emissions, raising questions about the potential for artificial origins. NASA has activated specialized teams from its Planetary Defense Coordination Office to closely monitor the object and prepare for potential contingency missions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 24, 2023</li>
    <li>Location of detection: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li>Comet speed: over 100,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023, at approximately 27 million kilometers</li>
    <li>NASA's response: Activation of specialized teams from the Planetary Defense Coordination Office</li>
    <li>Observation frequency of signals: 1.6 GHz</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 24, 2023, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS. The signals exhibited a frequency and pattern unlike typical natural emissions. Following this, NASA activated its Planetary Defense Coordination Office to investigate further.</p>
<p>In the days following the detection, global collaboration began as various space agencies, including the European Space Agency (ESA), joined efforts to cross-reference data and monitor the comet's trajectory. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The intensity and periodicity of emissions are being carefully monitored to determine whether there is any form of modulation or coding of information,” said a NASA representative.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This discovery has mobilized the scientific community to utilize the most advanced observational instruments to decipher the secrets this cosmic messenger carries,” noted an astrophysics expert.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notably different from previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. While ‘Oumuamua exhibited unusual acceleration and 2I/Borisov behaved like a conventional comet, 3I/ATLAS presents evidence of radio emissions that suggest a potentially artificial origin. This discovery underscores the need for improved detection systems to identify interstellar visitors earlier.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and international partners will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS leading up to its closest approach in December. The focus remains on confirming the nature of the radio signals and analyzing the comet's composition, which may provide insights into its origins and the technology behind the emissions.</p>
