      <h2>NASA Set to Release New Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA will unveil new images of comet 3I/ATLAS on Wednesday, November 19, at 3 PM EST (8 PM UT). The event will showcase imagery collected from various ground-based telescopes and spacecraft supported by the agency.</p>

<p>This release is significant as 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known ultra-rare objects to have entered the Solar System from interstellar space. The images are expected to provide insights into the comet’s behavior, especially following its perihelion, the closest approach to the Sun, which occurred on October 29.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date and time: November 19 at 3 PM EST (8 PM UT)</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, approximately 270 million kilometers (170 million miles) away</li>
    <li>Instruments involved: Hubble, JWST, Mars orbiters, ATLAS survey telescope, and Gemini observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its initial appearance in July 2025. It became invisible from Earth’s perspective on October 21 when it passed behind the Sun. The comet’s perihelion occurred on October 29, and it re-emerged in early November.</p>
<p>During perihelion, 3I/ATLAS was close to Mars, leading to expectations that Mars orbiters captured observations of the comet. The European Space Agency has confirmed some observations from Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Assets within NASA's science missions give the United States the unique capability to observe 3I/ATLAS almost the entire time it passes through our celestial neighborhood, and study – with complementary scientific instruments and from different directions – how the comet behaves," NASA stated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is classified as a 'dirty snowball,' consisting of rock and ice. As it approaches the Sun, the ice sublimates, creating a coma and tails of vapor and ions. Observations during perihelion are crucial for understanding the comet's activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the image release on November 19, the focus will shift to December 19 when 3I/ATLAS makes its closest approach to Earth, providing further opportunities for ground-based observations.</p>
