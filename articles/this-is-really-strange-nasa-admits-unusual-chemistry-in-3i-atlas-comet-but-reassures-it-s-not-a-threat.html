      <h2>This is really strange — NASA admits unusual chemistry in 3I/ATLAS comet but reassures it's not a threat</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that the 3I/ATLAS comet, which will pass Earth on December 19, 2025, exhibits unusual chemical properties but poses no threat to the planet. The comet, currently attracting global attention, has been described by NASA and international observatories as having a unique composition not previously observed in comets.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges current understanding of cometary chemistry. NASA, in collaboration with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, has stated that the comet emits a high concentration of gases, including methanol and hydrogen cyanide, which offers insights into the formation of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The 3I/ATLAS comet will pass Earth at a distance of approximately <strong>170 million miles (270 million km)</strong> on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA has reported that about <strong>8%</strong> of the comet's emitted vapor is methanol.</li>
    <li>The comet has been identified as the most chemically active comet ever measured.</li>
    <li>The James Webb Space Telescope has provided data indicating high levels of carbon dioxide compared to other solar comets.</li>
    <li>The comet's bright green glow is caused by diatomic carbon fluorescing in sunlight.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet has garnered attention since its discovery, with NASA and other observatories conducting ongoing observations. The comet's unusual chemical composition has been studied using advanced telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA has consistently emphasized that despite its strange characteristics, the comet does not exhibit any signs of artificial propulsion or non-natural origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The unusual chemistry of the comet does not make it a threat to the Earth,” NASA stated in its public briefings.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Avi Loeb, an astronomer from Harvard, described the comet's chemical richness as a reason for its perceived strangeness, noting it has been labeled a “serial killer” by some due to its active emissions.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects and their implications for understanding the universe. Previous studies of comets have provided insights into the building blocks of planetary systems. The unique properties of 3I/ATLAS highlight the diversity of cosmic objects and the challenges scientists face in interpreting data from such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to study the 3I/ATLAS comet as it approaches Earth, utilizing data from instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope and Juice to further understand its formation and survival in space.</p>
