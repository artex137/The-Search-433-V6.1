      <h2>Sun-facing tail of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals odd jet behaviour</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, currently on its outward journey back to interstellar space, has exhibited unusual jet behaviour as it passed Earth. Observations have revealed that the comet has produced strange, wobbling jets within a rare Sun-facing tail, according to researchers from the Two-meter Twin Telescope (TTT) at Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Spain.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insight into the behaviour of interstellar objects. The research team has noted that the comet is only the third known object confirmed to have entered our solar system from outside the galaxy, following Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. This observation may enhance understanding of how such bodies behave as they interact with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached the Sun on October 30, 2025, within about 130 million miles (210 million km).</li>
    <li>The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 168 million miles (270 million km).</li>
    <li>Observations occurred over 37 nights from July 2 to September 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Sun-facing tail of the comet extended about 620,000 miles (1 million km).</li>
    <li>Active jets were observed intermittently on seven nights between August 3 and August 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of 3I/ATLAS completes one full rotation roughly every 15 hours and 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 2, 2025, researchers began observing comet 3I/ATLAS at the Teide Observatory. Over the following weeks, the comet's appearance changed as it neared the Sun, transitioning from a fan-shaped distribution of dust to a more defined tail. By October 30, 2025, the comet reached its closest point to the Sun.</p>

<p>Throughout this period, the team noted the presence of jet-like structures that exhibited a regular wobble, suggesting an active and dynamic nucleus. After its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, the comet began its departure towards the outer solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Characterising jets in 3I thus represents a rare opportunity to investigate the physical behaviour of a pristine body formed in another planetary system,” the research team stated in their findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its interstellar origin but also for its unique jet behaviour. Previous comets within the solar system have shown similar features, but this is the first instance of such activity observed in an interstellar visitor. The findings could provide valuable data for future studies of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, researchers will analyze the data collected during its observations to further understand the dynamics of interstellar comets and their characteristics.</p>
