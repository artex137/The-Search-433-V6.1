      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits strong reverse tail and above-normal mass loss, says Loeb</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shown unusual behavior between November 22 and 24, 2025, according to astronomer Avi Loeb from Harvard University. Observations during this period recorded a bright coma, a long tail, and a significant antitail directed toward the Sun.</p>

<p>This behavior is noteworthy as it indicates that 3I/ATLAS is experiencing a mass loss that exceeds what is typically expected from natural comets. Experts are monitoring the comet closely to understand the implications of its acceleration and mass loss, which could challenge existing models of cometary behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation Dates: November 22-24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of Observations: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Key Observers: Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li>Characteristics: Bright coma, long tail, and a well-defined antitail</li>
    <li>Significant Findings: Non-gravitational acceleration detected</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between November 22 and 24, astronomers captured images of 3I/ATLAS. These images revealed the formation of a coma around the nucleus of the comet, as well as the development of a long tail extending opposite the Sun. The antitail appeared in the solar direction, indicating a unique alignment with the comet's orbital plane.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb noted that the antitail is larger than usual, suggesting significant material ejection and a high sublimation rate. This behavior raises questions about the underlying processes driving the comet's activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The amount of material required to generate the observed structure exceeds traditional models. If it were just natural, the object would become unstable in a short time."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unprecedented among known interstellar objects. Previous interstellar comets, such as 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, exhibited different characteristics. While 1I/’Oumuamua showed non-gravitational acceleration without a visible coma or tail, 2I/Borisov behaved like a typical comet.</p>

<p>The combination of a developed coma, high acceleration, and a strong antitail in 3I/ATLAS has not been recorded in extrasolar objects before, prompting further investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Large telescopes are scheduled to conduct additional observations in December 2025. These observations aim to achieve greater resolution of the comet's structure, perform detailed spectral analysis, and measure the chemical composition of the jets. Results will help determine whether the comet's characteristics have a natural origin or require alternative explanations.</p>
