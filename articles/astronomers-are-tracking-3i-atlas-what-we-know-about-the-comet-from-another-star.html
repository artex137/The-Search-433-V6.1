      <h2>Astronomers are tracking 3I/ATLAS: What we know about the comet from another star</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar visitor, was discovered in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. It passed closest to the Sun on 29 October 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.36 astronomical units (AU), or 203 million km.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System. Astronomers are studying 3I/ATLAS to learn more about ancient cosmic materials and the formation of planetary systems beyond our own. Observations from both the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes are ongoing, as scientists track its unique characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Discovered: July 2025 by ATLAS in Chile</li>
  <li>Closest approach to the Sun: 29 October 2025</li>
  <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: 1.36 AU (203 million km)</li>
  <li>Speed at perihelion: 68 km/s (about 42 miles per second)</li>
  <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 1.8 AU (270 million km)</li>
  <li>Size of nucleus: less than 1 km wide</li>
  <li>Brightness: between magnitude 12 and 14</li>
  <li>Tail length: about 100,000 km (around 60,000 miles)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. It passed near Mars in early October 2025 and made its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025. The comet temporarily became hidden near the Sun due to solar conjunction but is expected to become visible again in November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS offers scientists a unique chance to study material formed around other stars, helping understand planetary system formation beyond our Solar System,” said an astronomer involved in the tracking of the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System, following previous notable comets. Its unique trajectory and characteristics provide valuable data about interstellar materials, which is essential for understanding the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations will continue as ground-based and space telescopes track 3I/ATLAS for changes in brightness, composition, and activity. This ongoing research may inspire future scientific missions focused on interstellar exploration.</p>
