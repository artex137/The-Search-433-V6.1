      <h2>How NASA’s Observations of 3I/ATLAS Could Help Unlock Secrets of Planet Formation</h2>

<p>NASA has observed comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through the inner solar system. These observations began in late 2023 and aim to enhance understanding of the processes involved in planet formation.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it may provide insights into the early solar system and the origins of planetary bodies. NASA scientists are analyzing the data collected from various instruments aboard their spacecraft to unlock the secrets of how planets form from cometary material.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently in the inner solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA has been observing the comet since late 2023.</li>
    <li>The observations are part of ongoing research into planet formation.</li>
    <li>Data is being collected using various instruments on NASA spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Insights from this research could impact our understanding of the early solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late 2023, NASA began its observations of comet 3I/ATLAS as it moved closer to the Sun. Over the following weeks, scientists have utilized multiple instruments to gather data regarding the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<p>The research team has reported preliminary findings, indicating that the comet may contain materials that date back to the formation of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is an exciting opportunity to learn more about the building blocks of planets,” said a NASA scientist involved in the project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Cometary studies have historically provided valuable information about the early solar system. Previous missions, such as the Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, have yielded significant discoveries about the composition of comets and their role in planetary formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS and will release further findings as they analyze the collected data. The ongoing research may lead to new theories regarding the origins of planetary bodies in the solar system.</p>
