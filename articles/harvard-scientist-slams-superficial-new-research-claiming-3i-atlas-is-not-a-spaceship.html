      <h2>Harvard scientist slams ‘superficial’ new research claiming 3I/ATLAS is not a spaceship</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has criticized a new study regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, asserting that it behaves like a typical comet. The study, published on October 30 in the Research Notes of the AAS, comes as 3I/ATLAS is set to fly by Earth tomorrow, November 1.</p>

<p>This debate is significant as it highlights differing interpretations of the object’s behavior, which could have implications for our understanding of interstellar objects. Loeb has called on researchers to address what he describes as “anomalies” in 3I/ATLAS’ characteristics instead of dismissing them.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is scheduled to fly by Earth on November 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The study was led by Thomas Marshall Eubanks from Space Initiatives.</li>
    <li>Loeb has identified 13 non-cometary traits of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS exhibited unusual maneuvering during its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The research utilized data from NASA’s Psyche spacecraft and ESA’s Mars Trace Gas Orbiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor, has sparked considerable debate among scientists regarding its classification. On October 29, 2023, it made its closest approach to the Sun, during which it exhibited unusual movement. Following this event, a new study was published on October 30, 2023, claiming that the object's behavior aligns with that of typical comets.</p>
<p>Loeb has publicly critiqued this study, asserting that it fails to account for several anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Claiming that it, too, is a spacecraft does not fit the data,” said the research team led by Eubanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb stated, “What they need to do... is explain the anomalies.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate over 3I/ATLAS follows previous discussions in the scientific community regarding the classification of interstellar objects. Loeb has previously raised concerns about the object’s unusual characteristics, suggesting potential technological origins.</p>
<p>These discussions have implications for our understanding of celestial phenomena and the potential for extraterrestrial technologies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into 3I/ATLAS are expected as it approaches Earth. Researchers will continue to analyze data from ongoing observations to better understand its behavior and characteristics.</p>
