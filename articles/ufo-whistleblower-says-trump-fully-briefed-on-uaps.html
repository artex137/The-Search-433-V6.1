      <h2>UFO whistleblower says Trump fully briefed on UAPs</h2>

<p>David Grusch, a former representative on the Defense Department’s Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, has stated that former President Donald Trump was fully briefed on secret UFO programs and information regarding extraterrestrial life. Grusch made these claims during a recent interview, highlighting the ongoing debate about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and government transparency.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it adds to the growing discourse around UAPs, which many believe warrant further investigation. Grusch's claims have prompted additional whistleblowers to come forward and have led some lawmakers in Congress to advocate for increased transparency regarding UAP investigations and government operations related to these phenomena.</p>
