      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Back in View: Images Show Its Tail is Getting Longer</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has re-emerged in the morning sky as of mid-November 2025 after being obscured by the Sun since October 2025. New images reveal that the comet's tail is growing longer, attracting the attention of stargazers and astronomers.</p>

<p>This reappearance is significant as it allows scientists to observe the comet's tail and movements more closely. The comet has been monitored by Mars orbiters during its period of invisibility, and it is now positioned to be visible from Earth once more.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS re-emerged on November 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images taken by Gianluca Masi show the tail stretching to at least 0.7 degrees.</li>
    <li>The comet was previously hidden behind the Sun since October 2025.</li>
    <li>It is currently visible about 12 degrees above the eastern horizon.</li>
    <li>A live stream of the comet will occur on November 17, 2025, hosted by the Virtual Telescope Project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 6, 2025, renowned astrophotographer Gianluca Masi captured the first image of Comet 3I/ATLAS since its re-emergence. Despite interference from the near-full Moon, the comet was visible just above the eastern horizon.</p>
<p>By November 10, improved conditions allowed Masi to capture more detailed images, revealing the ion tail more clearly as the comet moved further into the morning sky. On November 11, Masi documented the tail extending to at least 0.7 degrees in the northeast direction.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Masi noted that although the Moon was setting and its glare was strong, the comet was still clearly visible just above the eastern horizon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Masi explained that the tail, which had been largely obscured at perihelion, was now more visible as the comet moved further into the morning sky.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2017 and has been noted for its unpredictable movements and striking appearance. Its presence in the morning sky is a significant event for astronomy enthusiasts, as it offers an opportunity for observation and study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Virtual Telescope Project plans to host a live stream on November 17, 2025, allowing viewers to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS in real-time. The comet is expected to continue its journey through the solar system, providing further opportunities for observation.</p>
