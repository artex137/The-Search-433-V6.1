      <h2>UFO sighting: At 87, Ed Hug shares his out-of-this-world experience</h2>

<p>Greenfield resident Ed Hug, 87, has recounted his passion for flying and his journey to becoming a member of the United Flying Octogenarians (UFO), a nationwide organization for pilots aged 80 or older. His story has garnered attention as it highlights the adventures and experiences of older individuals in aviation.</p>

<p>Hug's experiences matter as they illustrate the potential for lifelong learning and adventure, regardless of age. His journey has inspired others to pursue their passions and explore new horizons, even later in life. Authorities have not disclosed any formal investigations regarding his claims of UFO encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ed Hug is 87 years old.</li>
    <li>He began flying gliders in his early 30s after seeing a film in a movie theater.</li>
    <li>Hug has a total of 26 hours of training to regain solo flight certification.</li>
    <li>He was inspired to return to flying at age 73.</li>
    <li>Hug has not flown since one year before the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
    <li>He is a member of the United Flying Octogenarians.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Ed Hug's journey into aviation began in his early 30s when he watched "The Thomas Crown Affair," which sparked his interest in flying gliders. After 13 hours of practice in 1968, he achieved a student license. He transitioned to flying gas-powered airplanes after a break from gliding.</p>

<p>At age 73, Hug was inspired by conversations with fellow aviators at a luncheon and decided to return to flying. He trained for 26 hours to regain his solo flight certification before becoming a member of the UFO. Although he has not flown since before the COVID-19 pandemic, he remains open to flying again in the future.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I hadn’t flown in 40 years, but when they all started talking about flying, I was inspired to get back into it,” Hug said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It took 26 hours before I went solo. It’s not enough to know what to do. It has to be ingrained in your motor memory,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Hug's story reflects a growing trend among older adults who are pursuing aviation as a hobby. Organizations like the United Flying Octogenarians promote flying among seniors, encouraging them to remain active and engaged. This movement highlights the importance of lifelong learning and the pursuit of passions at any age.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Hug plans to obtain a current medical certificate and reconnect with a flight instructor, which is required every two years for recertification. He remains active in other pursuits, including traveling and maintaining his health through yoga and strength training.</p>
