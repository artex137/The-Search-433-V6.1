      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas registers record speed and remains on its way out of the solar system</h2>

<p>The astronomical community has confirmed that comet 3I/Atlas has reached a speed of 57 km/s as it travels through the solar system, with its closest approach to Earth expected on December 19, 2025. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this celestial event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the formation of planets beyond our solar system. Authorities, including astronomers from the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) in Chile, have been closely monitoring the comet's trajectory since its discovery in July 2025. Scientists have determined that 3I/Atlas poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 57 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> 1.8 Astronomical Units (AU) on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 30, 2025, at 1.4 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> July 2025, by ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Speeds:</strong> Oumuamua at 26 km/s; Borisov at 33 km/s</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: Comet 3I/Atlas is discovered through the ATLAS system in Chile.</p>
<p>October 30, 2025: The comet crosses its perihelion at a distance of 1.4 AU from the Sun.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: 3I/Atlas is expected to make its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 1.8 AU.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The hyperbolic trajectory of 3I/Atlas indicates that its speed exceeds the escape velocity during its passage through the solar system,” said an astronomer involved in the study. “This means that the comet is only deflected by solar gravity and will not be captured in a permanent orbit.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object detected in the solar system. Previous interstellar comets, like Oumuamua and Borisov, have provided valuable data on the dynamics of celestial bodies from outside our solar system. The unique speed and composition of 3I/Atlas suggest it formed in a markedly different environment compared to comets originating from within the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its perihelion, 3I/Atlas will continue its journey back to interstellar space, with a significant encounter with Jupiter expected in 2026. Scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition as it approaches this gas giant.</p>
