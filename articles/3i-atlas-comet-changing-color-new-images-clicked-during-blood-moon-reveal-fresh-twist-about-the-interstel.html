      <h2>3I/ATLAS comet changing color? New images clicked during Blood Moon reveal fresh twist about the interstellar visitor</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, believed to be an interstellar object, is likely changing color to bright green as it approaches the halfway point in its journey through the solar system. This observation emerged from new images taken on September 7, 2025, during a total lunar eclipse in Namibia, according to reports from Science.com.</p>

<p>This potential color change is significant as it may indicate the comet's increasing proximity to the sun, which could alter its chemical composition. Experts are analyzing the new photographs to understand the comet's behavior better, while no other observatories have confirmed this transformation yet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is likely turning bright green.</li>
    <li>New images were taken on September 7, 2025, during a blood moon total lunar eclipse.</li>
    <li>The photographs were captured by astrophotographers Michael Jäger and Gerald Rhemann in Namibia.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>It is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. It has since been observed as it travels through the solar system. The latest images were captured on September 7, 2025, during a total lunar eclipse, providing a unique opportunity to study the comet's characteristics in darker skies.</p>

<p>Reports indicate that the comet's coma has shifted in color from red to green, possibly due to chemical changes as it nears the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This could be due to a steep rise in the production of cyanide,” said Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb in a recent blog post regarding the comet's color change.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further explained that the object's evolution is shifting from sunlight scattering by dust to the production of bright icy grains, altering the opacity of the materials shed by 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. The ATLAS survey telescope, which first detected the comet, has been instrumental in monitoring its trajectory and behavior.</p>

<p>Previous observations of comets have shown changes in color and composition as they approach the sun, but the specific mechanisms can vary widely.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun. Further observations are expected to confirm the color change and provide more insight into the comet's chemical processes.</p>
