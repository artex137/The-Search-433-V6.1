      <h2>10 of the biggest conspiracy theories in space and astronomy, and how to defeat them</h2>

<p>Humans have embraced conspiracy theories for decades, ranging from the JFK assassination to claims about UFOs. This phenomenon persists as people continue to question established narratives. Various conspiracy theories related to space and astronomy have emerged, particularly regarding the existence of UFOs and the Moon landing.</p>

<p>This matters because these beliefs can influence public opinion and scientific literacy. Authorities, including NASA, have worked to debunk these theories through education and scientific evidence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA has addressed claims regarding the Moon landing and alien life.</li>
    <li>The Apollo program employed approximately 400,000 people over a decade.</li>
    <li>The cost of the Apollo program was about £19.1 billion ($25.8 billion), equivalent to more than £180 billion ($250 billion) today.</li>
    <li>NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has imaged Apollo landing sites.</li>
    <li>Claims of alien contact and suppression by governments remain unproven.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1969, NASA successfully landed astronauts on the Moon as part of the Apollo 11 mission. The event sparked numerous conspiracy theories, including claims that the landings were faked. In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 orbiter captured an image that appeared to show a human face on Mars, later debunked as a natural formation.</p>

<p>The term "UFO" gained popularity in the mid-20th century as reports of unidentified flying objects increased. The Roswell incident in 1947 further fueled speculation about alien encounters. In recent years, the narrative has expanded to include alleged alien abductions and the myth of Area 51.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The evidence for a faked Moon landing is easily refuted,” a NASA spokesperson said. “The agency has provided ample proof of its missions, including images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the Moon landing, skepticism about government transparency was less prevalent. Following the Apollo missions, distrust in government agencies like NASA grew, often fueled by pop culture, such as the film Capricorn One, which depicted a faked space mission.</p>

<p>Modern science recognizes the vastness of the universe and the potential for extraterrestrial life. However, the lack of direct evidence has led to the rise of various alien conspiracy theories, which often lack scientific support.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to investigate claims of alien life and UFO sightings. NASA remains committed to educating the public on these issues and debunking unfounded conspiracy theories through scientific evidence.</p>
