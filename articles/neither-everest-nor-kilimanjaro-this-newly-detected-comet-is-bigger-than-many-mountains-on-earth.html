      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Detected, Larger than Earth’s Tallest Mountains</h2>

<p>A newly discovered comet, named 3I/ATLAS, has been confirmed to be larger than many of Earth's highest mountains, according to NASA. The comet was officially detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. This discovery has generated significant interest within the scientific community.</p>

<p>The significance of this finding lies in its implications for understanding celestial bodies in our solar system. NASA reports that 3I/ATLAS is the largest interstellar object ever detected, measuring approximately 11 kilometers in diameter. Researchers believe studying this comet can provide insights into materials from distant star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Diameter: Approximately 11 kilometers</li>
    <li>Detection date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Telescope: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: Chile</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 240 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed: 209,000 km/h</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS began with initial observations made by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. On July 1, 2025, the comet was officially identified, prompting further analysis of previous images to reconstruct its trajectory. The comet's hyperbolic orbit indicates it is not bound by the Sun’s gravity and is traveling from outside the solar system.</p>

<p>Subsequent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope confirmed the comet's dimensions and captured detailed images of its dust trail. The latest photos were published by NASA and the European Space Agency on Thursday.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Any suggestion that it is artificial is absolute nonsense. These ideas are an insult to the exciting scientific work we are doing,” said astronomer Chris Lintott of Oxford University in response to conspiracy theories surrounding the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified by modern astronomy, following Oumuamua and Borisov. Its discovery underscores the presence of wandering objects from other stars that cross the solar system, providing opportunities for research into the origins of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars, ensuring it maintains a safe distance from both Mars and Earth. Further studies will focus on analyzing the comet's materials to enhance understanding of the evolution of the universe.</p>
