      <h2>NASA's Silence on 3I/ATLAS Sparks Wild Theories of Alien-Controlled Comet After Sudden Path Change</h2>

<p>NASA's ongoing silence about interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has prompted speculation among astronomers and the public regarding its unusual trajectory and chemical profile. The agency has not issued any public updates since early September 2025, leading to theories that the comet may be under 'artificial influence.'</p>

<p>This matter is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our Solar System, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The absence of information from NASA raises questions about the comet's behavior and its implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is on a hyperbolic path, indicating it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet's tail initially pointed toward the Sun before shifting direction.</li>
    <li>The James Webb Space Telescope study found a CO<sub>2</sub>-to-water ratio eight times higher than typical Solar-System comets.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to reach perihelion in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency expects the comet to re-emerge from behind the Sun in December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025 by ATLAS in Chile. Since then, astronomers have observed its unusual behavior, including the shifting of its tail. The James Webb Space Telescope conducted a study that revealed its unusual chemical composition. NASA has not provided updates since early September 2025, leading to speculation about the comet's trajectory and possible alien influence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa told The Guardian that the comet 'behaves like a natural body in all observable ways,' rejecting claims of alien control.</blockquote>
<blockquote>'It's a unique window into material born around another star,' said one astronomer quoted by Live Science.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its anomalies, which have led some scientists, like Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, to suggest comparisons with 'Oumuamua. While Loeb has raised questions about the comet’s composition and trajectory, most scientists remain skeptical and caution against jumping to conclusions about extraterrestrial influences. They argue that interstellar comets can exhibit unfamiliar dynamics due to their formation under different physical conditions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The European Space Agency expects to observe 3I/ATLAS again in December 2025 when it becomes visible after solar conjunction. This upcoming observation may clarify whether the comet's tail and trajectory anomalies persist, potentially expanding knowledge of interstellar chemistry and comet physics.</p>
