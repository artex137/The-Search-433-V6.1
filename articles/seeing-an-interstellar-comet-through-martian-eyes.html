      <h2>Seeing an Interstellar Comet Through Martian Eyes</h2>

<p>European Space Agency (ESA) scientists have successfully tracked the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 1 July 2025, as it passed within 29 million kilometres of Mars from 1 to 7 October 2025. This marks a significant achievement in celestial observation, as no injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</p>

<p>The tracking of 3I/ATLAS is crucial because it provides insights into other stellar systems and demonstrates innovative techniques for planetary defence. The ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) repurposed its CaSSIS camera to capture images of the comet, significantly improving the accuracy of its predicted position. This observation represents a first in planetary science, with data being the first astrometric measurements submitted to the Minor Planet Center from a spacecraft orbiting another planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars occurred on 3 October 2025, at 29 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Observation period lasted from 1 to 7 October 2025.</li>
    <li>ESA’s ExoMars TGO provided critical data for trajectory calculations.</li>
    <li>First astrometric measurements from a non-Earth orbiting spacecraft accepted by the Minor Planet Center.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on 1 July 2025. As it approached Mars, ESA scientists identified a unique opportunity to track the comet using the ExoMars TGO, which was in a suitable position to observe the comet from a different angle than Earth-based telescopes.</p>

<p>From 1 to 7 October 2025, the TGO captured images of 3I/ATLAS, allowing for improved trajectory calculations due to its proximity to the comet. The data collected during this time was later submitted to the Minor Planet Center, marking a notable achievement in planetary science.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The data on 3I/ATLAS represent a significant advancement in our ability to track celestial objects from beyond Earth,” said a spokesperson from ESA. “This demonstrates the potential of using spacecraft in orbit around other planets for precise measurements.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects are rare, with 3I/ATLAS being only the third such object detected since 'Oumuamua in 2017 and comet Borisov in 2019. These comets provide valuable insights into the formation of material in distant stellar systems, and tracking them is essential for future planetary defence efforts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA plans to use the techniques developed during the tracking of 3I/ATLAS for future observations of potentially hazardous objects. The success of this mission highlights the importance of multi-platform observations for accurate trajectory calculations in planetary defence scenarios.</p>
