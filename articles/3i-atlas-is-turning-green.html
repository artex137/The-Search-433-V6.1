      <h2>3I/ATLAS is Turning Green</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has transitioned from a reddish hue to a green glow, as observed in the latest image taken on September 7, 2025, according to reports from astronomers Michael Jäger and Gerald Rhemann. This change in color may be linked to a significant increase in cyanide production, which was noted by the Very Large Telescope on August 25, 2025.</p>

<p>The shift in color is important as it suggests changes in the composition of the comet as it approaches the Sun. The ATLAS telescope team has released data indicating that the characteristics of the comet have evolved, which may provide insights into its behavior and composition as it nears Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Latest image of 3I/ATLAS taken on September 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>Cyanide production reported to have increased significantly on August 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>Data from the ATLAS telescope dates back to March 28, 2025.</li>
    <li>Hubble Space Telescope image captured on July 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>Webb Space Telescope data collected on August 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>Plume of gas around 3I/ATLAS consists mainly of carbon dioxide (87% by mass).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On March 28, 2025, the ATLAS telescope team began collecting data on comet 3I/ATLAS. By July 21, 2025, a Hubble Space Telescope image revealed unusual scattering of light towards the Sun. On August 6, 2025, data from the Webb Space Telescope indicated the composition of the comet's gas plume. Finally, on August 25, 2025, the Very Large Telescope reported a dramatic increase in cyanide production, and on September 7, 2025, the comet was observed glowing green.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The growth of the cross section of scattered light around 3I/ATLAS suggests a shift in the production of small, optically bright icy grains.” — ATLAS telescope team
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This discussion is not a matter of public relations in a popularity contest, but instead a topic of great relevance for national security and science.” — Avi Loeb, Galileo Project leader
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike these predecessors, 3I/ATLAS displays signs of evaporation and an unusual composition, raising questions about its origin and behavior. Previous interstellar objects have not shown similar features, making 3I/ATLAS a subject of interest in ongoing astronomical studies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ATLAS telescope team will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Further observations may provide additional insights into the comet's behavior and composition, which could enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
