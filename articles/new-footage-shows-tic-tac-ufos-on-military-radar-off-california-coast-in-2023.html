      <h2>New footage shows ‘tic tac’ UFOs on military radar off California coast in 2023</h2>

<p>New footage recorded by a military combat ship’s radar has captured one of four “tic-tac”-shaped unidentified objects flying off the coast of California on February 15, 2023. The radar footage was recorded by active duty Naval officers stationed on the USS Jackson, who also witnessed one of the objects firsthand, according to ufologist Jeremy Corbell, who released the clip on April 8, 2025.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as it adds to the ongoing investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) encountered by the U.S. Navy. Authorities are now examining the footage and the events surrounding it, as it raises questions about the nature of these objects and their implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date of sightings: February 13 and February 15, 2023</li>
<li>Location: Off the coast of San Diego, California</li>
<li>Involved vessel: USS Jackson</li>
<li>Number of UAPs observed: Four</li>
<li>Witnesses: Active duty Naval officers</li>
<li>Notable comments from personnel: Navy operators discussed the objects on radar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the night of February 13, 2023, an active duty Naval officer observed the first “self-illuminated” tic-tac-shaped object emerging from the Pacific Ocean and transitioning into flight without visible propulsion. The officer then rushed to the radar room to track the object using forward-looking infrared radar (FLIR).</p>

<p>On February 15, 2023, the USS Jackson crew filmed the radar footage of the four unidentified objects. Witnesses reported that the objects executed synchronized maneuvers before departing rapidly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You have trained observers, people that are taking a risk by going to journalists or putting it out,” said Corbell on his podcast Weaponized, referring to the Naval officers involved.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident recalls previous encounters with UAPs, including a series of sightings reported in July 2019, where a fleet of unidentified objects harassed U.S. warships off the California coast. Those sightings involved objects that avoided radar detection.</p>

<p>In 2022, former NASA Astronaut Leroy Chiao reported a close encounter with two metallic-looking orbs while flying a private plane in Texas, which came within 10 feet of his aircraft and exhibited no visible means of propulsion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the footage and the incidents are ongoing, with authorities expected to analyze the data for further insights into the nature of the observed UAPs.</p>
