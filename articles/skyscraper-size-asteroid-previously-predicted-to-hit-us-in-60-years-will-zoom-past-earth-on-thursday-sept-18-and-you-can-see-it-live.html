      <h2>Skyscraper-size asteroid to fly past Earth on September 18</h2>
<p>The asteroid 2025 FA22 will make a close approach to Earth on Thursday, September 18, traveling at more than 24,000 mph (38,600 km/h) and coming within 520,000 miles (835,000 kilometers) of our planet, according to the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

<p>This flyby is significant because 2025 FA22 was previously listed as a potential threat to Earth, with a slim 0.01% chance of impacting the planet during its next close approach in 2089. However, recent observations have confirmed it poses no imminent danger, and it was removed from ESA’s Risk List in May.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Asteroid Name:</strong> 2025 FA22</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Flyby:</strong> September 18, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 24,000 mph (38,600 km/h)</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum Distance:</strong> 520,000 miles (835,000 kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Between 427 and 951 feet (130 and 290 meters) in diameter</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Discovery:</strong> March 2023 by Pan-STARRS 2 telescope in Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream Start Time:</strong> 23:00 EDT on September 17, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>2025 FA22 was discovered in March 2023. Shortly after, it was identified as having a 0.01% chance of hitting Earth during a close approach in 2089, placing it at the top of ESA’s impact risk list. Following high-priority observations, astronomers refined its trajectory, leading to its removal from the risk list in May 2023.</p>
<p>The asteroid will reach its closest point to Earth in the early hours of September 18, 2023. It will be visible via a livestream and with telescopes and binoculars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“However, high-priority follow-up observations soon allowed astronomers to refine the asteroid’s trajectory and rule out any impact risk,” ESA representatives stated regarding 2025 FA22.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While 2025 FA22 poses no danger, practicing our ability to measure these properties is important, as they influence how an asteroid will react to any attempt to deflect it off of a collision course with Earth,” ESA representatives added about the ongoing practice scenario.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>2025 FA22's brief listing as a potential threat reflects the ongoing efforts of space agencies to monitor near-Earth objects. The European Space Agency and NASA continually track such asteroids to ensure public safety and preparedness for any future threats.</p>
<p>Following the recent removal from the risk list, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) is using this flyby to practice emergency protocols and measure the asteroid's characteristics for future deflection missions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the flyby on September 18, 2023, 2025 FA22 will return for another close approach in 2173, when it will come within approximately 200,000 miles (320,000 kilometers) of Earth. Researchers will continue to monitor the asteroid during future encounters.</p>
