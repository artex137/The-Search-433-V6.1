      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaches peak visibility in pre-dawn sky in January 2026</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System, is currently visible in the pre-dawn sky as of January 2026. The comet, which was detected on July 1, 2025, using the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, has an apparent magnitude of approximately 15.6, making it visible only with optical equipment.</p>

<p>The visibility of comet 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity for astronomers and enthusiasts alike. Observations have indicated its current position in the constellation Cancer, favoring viewing on the eastern horizon before dawn. The comet poses no risk of collision with Earth, according to scientists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Detection date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Current position:</strong> Constellation Cancer</li>
    <li><strong>Apparent magnitude:</strong> Approximately 15.6</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum distance from Jupiter:</strong> 53.61 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Relative speed at closest approach:</strong> Approximately 66 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> Estimated between 600 and 800 meters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. Initial analyses revealed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originated from interstellar space. Observations continued through late 2025 as astronomers across the globe recorded images of the comet.</p>

<p>As of early January 2026, the comet remains visible, particularly in the southern hemisphere, where conditions favor observation. The object is expected to reach its minimum distance from Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The high speed makes the encounter unique for studies of orbital dynamics,” said a spokesperson from the scientific community involved in monitoring the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Its detection and observation contribute to the understanding of primordial material from other star systems and the dynamics of the interstellar medium.</p>

<p>Prior studies of similar objects have underscored the importance of early warning systems for tracking interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026. Data collected during this period is expected to enhance models of interstellar body evolution and gravitational interactions.</p>
