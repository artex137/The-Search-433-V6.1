      <h2>Avi Loeb discusses how the anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS appears to flip without responding to solar radiation</h2>

<p>Harvard physicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has examined the unusual characteristics of interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> in recent discussions, noting the object's anti-tail flipped orientation relative to its direction of motion at perihelion. Loeb made these observations public in a Medium post on December 9, 2025, and during an interview on The Hannibal TV, uploaded to YouTube on December 10, 2025.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it challenges conventional understanding of comet behavior. Loeb argues that the anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS does not behave as expected under solar radiation and wind, suggesting it may contain materials that resist these forces. His claims call for a reevaluation of the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which NASA has categorized as a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb's Medium post was published on December 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope observed 3I/ATLAS on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was approximately 287 million kilometres (178 million miles) from Earth during the latest observations.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first reported in July 2025, capturing the attention of astronomers due to its interstellar origin. The Hubble Space Telescope conducted its first observations of the comet on July 21, 2025, when it was approaching the sun.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest approach to the sun. Following this, Hubble revisited the object on November 30, 2025, revealing the peculiar behavior of its anti-tail.</p>
<p>Loeb's Medium post discussing these findings was published on December 9, 2025, and he further elaborated on the topic in a YouTube interview on December 10, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It still shows the anti-tail. In other words, the glow, the halo around the 3I/ATLAS, the halo of light is extended in the direction of the Sun,” said Loeb during his interview.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb criticized NASA for releasing blurry images and dismissing the anomalies as insignificant, stating, “NASA lacks scientific enthusiasm and acts with a bureaucratic attitude.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>He praised the Japanese Space Agency for utilizing an X-ray satellite to observe 3I/ATLAS, noting it was the first time X-ray emissions from an interstellar object were reported.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS’s anti-tail has raised questions since its discovery. Previous studies of comets have shown that anti-tails typically orient away from the sun due to solar forces. Loeb’s claims challenge this understanding, suggesting the presence of materials that behave differently.</p>
<p>NASA has maintained that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, despite Loeb's suggestion that it may be a technological entity. The contrasting views have sparked ongoing debate within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS are expected as researchers analyze more data from various space agencies. Loeb has called for experts to remain open to alternative explanations regarding the object’s nature.</p>
