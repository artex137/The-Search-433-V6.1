      <h2>Comet From Another Solar System Approaching Sun—What We Know</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS is approaching its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2025, according to NASA and planetary scientists. The comet was first discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, and is located approximately 670 million kilometers from Earth at that time. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, maintaining a distance of at least 240 million kilometers from the planet.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks only the third known interstellar comet, drawing attention from scientists eager to study its characteristics. Jason Wright, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University, noted, “This is only the third such interstellar comet we’ve ever been able to study, and planetary scientists are super excited to learn about what comets in other solar systems are like.” NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured images of the comet, which shows a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust emanating from its icy nucleus.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Located about 670 million kilometers from Earth at the time of discovery.</li>
    <li>Will reach its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed it poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar comets include 1I/`Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 1, 2025: 3I/ATLAS is discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</p>
<p>July 21, 2025: NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captures an image of 3I/ATLAS from a distance of 277 million miles (approximately 446 million kilometers) from Earth.</p>
<p>October 29, 2025: The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is only the third such interstellar comet we’ve ever been able to study.” – Jason Wright, Penn State University</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We know these objects are from elsewhere in the galaxy because they have hyperbolic orbits, unbound from the solar system.” – Darryl Seligman, Michigan State University</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Before the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects had been identified: 1I/`Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The rarity of interstellar comets makes each discovery significant for understanding the formation of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the sun, scientists will continue to monitor its behavior and characteristics, gathering data that may provide insights into the nature of comets from other solar systems.</p>
