      <h2>Gayley weighs in on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Dr. Ken Gayley, an astronomy professor at the University of Iowa, discussed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during an interview with LiveNOW’s Austin Westfall on November 10, 2025. He addressed online conspiracies suggesting that the comet may be an artificial object or a probe from another civilization.</p>

<p>Gayley stated that such objects are likely natural, formed in different star systems under circumstances that remain unclear. He emphasized the importance of studying these objects as natural phenomena unless compelling evidence suggests otherwise.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was 277 million miles from Earth on July 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>Dr. Ken Gayley is a professor at the University of Iowa.</li>
    <li>Interview conducted on November 10, 2025.</li>
    <li>Image of the comet captured by Hubble; processed by Joseph DePasquale (STScI).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS at a distance of 277 million miles from Earth. Following this, on November 10, Dr. Ken Gayley provided insights regarding the comet during an interview.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We would always start off with the assumption that these are natural objects and we would study them in that way. And if there's really very powerful evidence that they're not, then we might be led toward another direction,” Dr. Gayley said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“But for now, there's still plenty of evidence that these are potentially just completely natural objects,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of several interstellar objects that have sparked interest and speculation regarding their origins. The scientific community generally approaches such discoveries with a focus on natural explanations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS and similar objects to gather more data and understand their origins. Further analysis may be conducted as new evidence emerges.</p>
