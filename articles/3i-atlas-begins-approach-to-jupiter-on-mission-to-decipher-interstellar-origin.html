      <h2>3I/ATLAS begins approach to Jupiter on mission to decipher interstellar origin</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has commenced a critical phase of its journey as it approaches Jupiter's gravitational field, according to astronomers and space agencies monitoring the celestial body. The object is expected to reach its closest proximity to Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<p>This mission is significant as scientists aim to gain insights into the object’s origin and properties. The interaction with Jupiter's immense mass will provide data that could validate or challenge existing astrophysical models, especially regarding the object's behavior in a region of intense radiation and magnetism.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter: March 2026</li>
    <li>Current trajectory involves passing through a region of intense radiation</li>
    <li>Expected observations include changes in surface structure and gas emissions</li>
    <li>Data will be compared with previous observations from the Hubble Space Telescope</li>
    <li>Diameter of 3I/ATLAS: approximately 1 km</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, 3I/ATLAS began its approach to Jupiter. Astronomers have used high-precision instruments to monitor its speed and rotation. The object is anticipated to pass through a radiation zone that may affect its structural integrity and gas emissions.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS nears Jupiter, scientists will analyze how the gravitational forces and magnetic environment influence the object. This includes observing whether the jets of dust and gas emitted by the object remain stable or are affected by the magnetospheric plasma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The interaction with Jupiter will act as a natural scanner, revealing data that conventional telescopes have not been able to capture so far,” said a spokesperson for the international astronomy community.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Continuous monitoring serves to improve planetary defense systems, using 3I/ATLAS as a case study on how external bodies react to large planetary masses,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS represents a rare opportunity for scientists to study an interstellar object in detail. Previous close encounters with celestial bodies have provided valuable data, and this event is expected to yield insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar materials.</p>

<p>The analysis of 3I/ATLAS is critical for understanding how such objects may affect planetary defense strategies in the future. The data collected will contribute to refining models used for tracking and intercepting potentially hazardous objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and emissions closely. The findings from this encounter will inform future studies and enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their dynamics in our solar system.</p>
