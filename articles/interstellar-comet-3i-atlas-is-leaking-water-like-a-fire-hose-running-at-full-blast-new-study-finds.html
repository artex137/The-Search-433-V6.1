      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS is Leaking Water Like a 'Fire Hose Running at Full Blast'</h2>

<p>A new study has found that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is leaking water at a rate of approximately 40 kilograms per second, equivalent to "a fire hose running at full blast." This observation was made using NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory during July and August 2025, when the comet was about 2.9 times farther from the sun than Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it allows scientists to compare 3I/ATLAS, an object from another star system, with comets that originate from our solar system. The study, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters on September 30, highlights the implications for understanding the chemistry of distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed in July and August 2025.</li>
    <li>It is leaking water at a rate of approximately 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>About 8% of the comet's surface is estimated to be active.</li>
    <li>Observations were made using NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</li>
    <li>The study was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters on September 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was about 30 million kilometers from Mars in early October 2025.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency plans to observe 3I/ATLAS with its Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) in November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July and August 2025, scientists at Auburn University used the Swift telescope to observe 3I/ATLAS. They detected the faint ultraviolet glow of hydroxyl (OH), indicating the presence of water molecules. The study revealed that the comet was losing water at a significant rate, prompting further investigation into its surface activity.</p>

<p>In early October 2025, the European Space Agency's Mars orbiters spotted 3I/ATLAS again as it passed about 30 million kilometers from Mars. The agency announced plans to continue monitoring the comet.</p>

<p>In November 2025, JUICE will observe 3I/ATLAS just after its closest approach to the sun, when it is expected to be most active. Data from these observations are anticipated in February 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “When we detect water — or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH — from an interstellar comet, we're reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, a professor of physics at Auburn University.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, a postdoctoral researcher at Auburn University. “Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object from another star system observed in our solar system. Previous interstellar comets, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have exhibited different characteristics, leading to ongoing research into their compositions and behaviors. Understanding these comets can shed light on the building blocks of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the observations from JUICE in November 2025, scientists expect to receive data about 3I/ATLAS in February 2026. This data may provide further insights into the comet's activity and its implications for interstellar chemistry.</p>
