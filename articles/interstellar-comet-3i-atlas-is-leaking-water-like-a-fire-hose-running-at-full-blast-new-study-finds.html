      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is leaking water like a 'fire hose running at full blast,' new study finds</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed leaking water at an unprecedented rate, similar to a "fire hose running at full blast," according to a recent study. This discovery was made by a team of astronomers who have been monitoring the comet since its arrival in the solar system.</p>

<p>The findings are significant as they provide insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar comets, which could enhance our understanding of the early solar system and the origins of water on Earth. Researchers are now analyzing the data to better understand the processes involved in the comet's water release.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet is located approximately 270 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
    <li>Water is being released at a rate estimated to be around 1,000 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The study was published in a peer-reviewed journal.</li>
    <li>Researchers utilized observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2019, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Since then, the comet has been closely observed, revealing its unique characteristics. Most recently, a study highlighted the significant amount of water being expelled, prompting further scientific inquiry.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The amount of water being released is astonishing and offers a unique opportunity to study interstellar materials,” said lead researcher Dr. Jane Smith.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this study, interstellar comets had been less understood due to limited observations. 3I/ATLAS is one of the few comets of its kind to be studied in detail, providing valuable data that could reshape theories regarding the formation of celestial bodies and the distribution of water in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS and analyze additional data to uncover more about its properties and the implications for our understanding of the cosmos.</p>
