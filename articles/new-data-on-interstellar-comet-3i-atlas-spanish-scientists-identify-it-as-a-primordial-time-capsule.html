      <h2>New data on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: Spanish scientists identify it as a primordial “time capsule”</h2>

<p>A team of Spanish researchers has identified comet 3I/ATLAS as a unique interstellar object that may serve as a "cosmic time capsule." The comet was first detected on July 1, 2023, through the ATLAS observatory in Chile. It is believed to have traveled from another planetary system, making it one of only three known interstellar objects discovered to date.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it allows scientists to study the evolution of materials from other star systems, providing insights into the formation of distant worlds. Researchers at the Center for Information and Communication Technology Research (CITIC) at the University of A Coruña have reconstructed the comet's trajectory over the past 10 million years, utilizing data from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Gaia mission.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth is approximately 270 million kilometers (168 million miles).</li>
    <li>It has traveled through the Milky Way for around 10 million years.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is one of three known interstellar objects, alongside ‘Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
    <li>Data for the research was provided by the ESA's Gaia mission.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers detected comet 3I/ATLAS at the ATLAS observatory in Chile. Following its discovery, researchers led by Xabier Pérez Couto at CITIC began analyzing its trajectory. They utilized data from the ESA's Gaia mission to trace its path through the Milky Way over the last 10 million years. The findings have highlighted the comet's potential as a time capsule of ancient material from another star's history.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “What makes 3I/ATLAS unique is that it allows us to study the evolution of objects originating from other star systems, something we’ve only seen in theory until now. Each observation is like opening a window into the Universe’s past,” said Xabier Pérez Couto.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a small group of interstellar objects that have been identified in recent years. The discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019 marked significant milestones in our understanding of interstellar materials. These objects provide valuable information about the chemical compositions and characteristics of other planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are continuing to study 3I/ATLAS as it passes through our solar system. The ESA has already captured images of the comet, and astronomers worldwide are eager to analyze its chemical fingerprints to gain further insights into the origins of other worlds.</p>
