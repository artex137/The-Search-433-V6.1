      <h2>Trump Briefed on Alien-Human Hybrids, Claims Whistleblower</h2>

<p>U.S. President Donald Trump was “fully briefed” on alien-human hybrids and other extraterrestrial matters, according to whistleblower David Grusch, a retired Air Force Major, during an interview on December 9, 2025. Grusch alleged that Trump received detailed reports on crashed UFOs and non-human bodies.</p>

<p>This disclosure raises significant questions about government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Grusch, who now advises Congress’s UAP Task Force, has urged that the U.S. disclose what it has reportedly kept hidden from the public. He stated that current administration officials, including Trump, are aware of the existence of alien species and their interactions with humanity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of claim: December 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Whistleblower: David Grusch, retired Air Force Major</li>
    <li>Alleged briefings include: crashed UFOs, non-human bodies, alien-human hybrids</li>
    <li>Grusch’s position: Advisor to Congress’s UAP Task Force</li>
    <li>Physical evidence: No public evidence has been presented</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 9, 2025, David Grusch appeared on Fox News and made claims about President Trump’s knowledge of alien-human hybrids. Grusch stated that he personally viewed classified materials related to these topics. He mentioned that Trump has been briefed on at least four alien races, including the Nordics and the Greys.</p>
<p>Grusch also noted that Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison corroborated parts of his account regarding the Nordics' advanced technology. The claims suggest a broader acknowledgment of extraterrestrial life within the U.S. government, although no physical evidence has been made public.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Members of this current administration are very well aware of this reality, including the President,” Grusch said. “Trump is very knowledgeable on this subject.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I was literally in fear both professionally and in my personal life for speaking out,” Grusch added, referring to alleged intimidation he faced.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Grusch's claims come amid heightened interest in UAPs and extraterrestrial life, particularly following recent congressional hearings on the subject. Historically, the U.S. government has been reticent to disclose information regarding UFOs, often denying the retrieval of alien technology.</p>
<p>Past promises from Trump to declassify UFO files have not materialized, and he has expressed skepticism about alien claims. However, Grusch posits that if Trump were to disclose this information, it could have significant implications for global leadership.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, there have been no official investigations launched in response to Grusch's claims. The White House has not commented on the allegations, and it remains unclear if any further actions will be taken regarding the disclosure of information on UAPs.</p>
