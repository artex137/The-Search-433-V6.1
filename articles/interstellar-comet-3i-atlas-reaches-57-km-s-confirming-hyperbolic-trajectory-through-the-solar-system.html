      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-05 21:25 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas reaches 57 km/s, confirming hyperbolic trajectory through the solar system</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is approaching our solar system at a speed of 57 kilometers per second, according to the global astronomical community. This remarkable speed confirms its hyperbolic trajectory, which prevents it from being captured by the Sun's gravity as it continues its journey through deep space.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/Atlas lies in its status as the third confirmed interstellar object, following Oumuamua and Borisov. Scientists view its passage as a valuable opportunity for research, enabling them to study materials from another star system without the need for extensive space missions. Continuous monitoring is essential for refining gravitational interaction models and accurately predicting the comet's path as it exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas travels at a speed of <strong>57 km/s</strong>.</li>
    <li>It has been confirmed as the third interstellar comet, joining <strong>Oumuamua</strong> and <strong>Borisov</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet's hyperbolic trajectory ensures it will not enter a permanent orbit around the Sun.</li>
    <li>Gravitational interactions with the Sun will last a few weeks.</li>
    <li>Advanced telescopes are currently used to analyze its composition, speed, and trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered recently, with confirmation of its interstellar origin achieved through detailed telescopic observations. It has been observed that the comet's initial speed exceeds the necessary velocity to escape solar attraction, leading to a deviation in its route due to the gravitational influence of the Sun.</p>

<p>Observatories worldwide are monitoring the comet's trajectory in real time, allowing scientists to refine their orbital data and track its movements closely.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/Atlas through the solar system provides an unprecedented opportunity to study materials from another star system,” said an astronomer involved in ongoing observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is part of a small group of confirmed interstellar objects. The first, Oumuamua, was detected in 2017 and displayed unexpected acceleration due to the release of gases. The study of interstellar comets is essential for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it moves away from the Sun, employing advanced spectroscopy to analyze its chemical composition and confirm its classification as an interstellar object.</p>
