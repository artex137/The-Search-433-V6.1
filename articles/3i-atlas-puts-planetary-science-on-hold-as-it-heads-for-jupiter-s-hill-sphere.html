      <h2>3I/ATLAS Puts Planetary Science on Hold as It Heads for Jupiter's Hill Sphere</h2>

<p>The scientific community is awaiting crucial data about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter's Hill radius, with a significant observation scheduled for 16 March 2026. Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University, an authority on classifying cosmic visitors, has decided to delay updates on his 'Loeb Classification Scale' until high-resolution observations are completed. This decision follows the discovery of anomalous features in the current data, which have complicated the analysis.</p>

<p>This pause in classification highlights the importance of rigorous scientific validation, as extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The upcoming encounter with Jupiter presents a unique opportunity to study the object’s behaviour under the influence of the gas giant's gravity, which could reveal new insights into its nature and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Next significant observation: 16 March 2026</li>
    <li>Location: Jupiter's Hill radius</li>
    <li>Key figure: Professor Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li>Current status: Awaiting high-resolution observations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, scientists have noted several anomalies in its data, including a persistent sunward anti-tail. This has led Professor Loeb to postpone updates to his classification scale until after the object's gravitational test at Jupiter.</p>

<p>The gravitational encounter with Jupiter presents an invaluable opportunity for scientists to observe how 3I/ATLAS responds to the planet’s dominant gravitational field.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I declined to update the scale until new data from the period bracketing its closest approach to Earth is publicly released and analysed,” Professor Loeb said, noting that the analysis process may extend into March 2026.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS has sparked renewed interest in planetary defence and the militarisation of space. The geopolitical implications of such encounters have increased concerns about transparency and verification in space science.</p>

<p>Recent comments from global leaders, including Vladimir Putin, have highlighted the sensitive nature of discussions surrounding interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, with the aim of gathering and analysing data that could reshape our understanding of interstellar objects. The next major updates are expected following the gravitational test in March 2026.</p>
