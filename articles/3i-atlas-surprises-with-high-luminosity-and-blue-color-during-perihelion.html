      <h2>3I/ATLAS surprises with high luminosity and blue color during perihelion</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed a sudden increase in luminosity and an intense blue hue during its perihelion, which occurred between September and October 2025. Satellite observations from STEREO-A, SOHO, and GOES-19 recorded these changes as the comet approached the Sun, challenging traditional models of cometary activity. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it may provide new insights into cometary behavior. Scientists are analyzing the data collected to refine existing models and understand the comet's unique characteristics. Continuous observations are underway to monitor the comet's activity and brightness after perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Increased luminosity and blue color of comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Period: September 15 to October 20, 2025</li>
    <li>Minimum distance to the Sun: approximately 0.5 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Brightness increased by 50% compared to initial projections</li>
    <li>Blue color predominated in analyzed spectra</li>
    <li>Satellites involved: STEREO-A, SOHO, GOES-19</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS exhibited progressive activity leading up to its perihelion in October 2025. Observations indicated peaks in brightness at short intervals, coinciding with solar warming. The comet's behavior deviated from typical models, which usually predict a gradual release of gases.</p>

<p>Between September 15 and October 20, satellites captured images showing the comet's unexpected blue hue, indicating a reflection of light at short wavelengths. This differs from the more common reddish tones observed in other comets, suggesting a unique composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is surprising. Interstellar comets rarely show such characteristics,” said Professor Avi Loeb from Harvard University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is not the first interstellar comet observed, but its unique features set it apart from others like 2I/Borisov, which did not exhibit a dominant blue color. The current observations challenge existing theories about cometary activity and composition, particularly regarding the presence of light elements and unusual emission lines.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research teams will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels out of the solar system. Future observations will aim to verify the stability of its brightness and further analyze the data to integrate findings into current models of interstellar comets.</p>
