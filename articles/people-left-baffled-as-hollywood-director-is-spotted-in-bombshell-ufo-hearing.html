    <li>Date: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: United States Congress</li>
    <li>Notable attendee: Hollywood director Colin Trevorrow</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Four individuals, including George Knapp and three US veterans</li>

<p>Hollywood director Colin Trevorrow has attended a UFO hearing in Congress on September 9, 2025, leaving fans surprised. The filmmaker, known for the Jurassic World franchise, was seen sitting behind journalist George Knapp during the hearing, which featured testimonies from four witnesses regarding their experiences with unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it marks the third of its kind in Congress, where witnesses have provided sworn testimonies about UFO sightings and questioned the transparency of the military regarding these incidents. The UAP term has replaced UFO in government discussions since 2023.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 9, 2025, the House Oversight Committee's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets convened to hear testimonies about UFOs. Colin Trevorrow was present, reportedly working on a film about George Knapp, who testified at the hearing. The witnesses included US Air Force veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli, Navy veteran and UAP witness Chief Alexandro Wiggins, and US Air Force veteran Dylan Borland.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Congressman Eric Burlison presented previously unseen footage from October 30, 2024, showing a UFO being struck by a Hellfire missile. Witness Nuccetelli described the footage as "exceptional evidence" of UFO existence. The witnesses shared their experiences with various unexplained craft, including giant triangles and glowing cubes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This video is exceptional evidence of the existence of UFOs,” said Jeffrey Nuccetelli, referring to the footage presented during the hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dylan Borland claimed that multiple government agencies blocked him from getting work after he reported a UFO sighting to his superiors.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing is part of a broader governmental effort to address and investigate UFO sightings. The UAP term has been adopted to encompass any unexplained object or anomaly in the air, sea, or space. Previous hearings have sought to increase transparency regarding military encounters with UFOs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims made during the hearing are expected to continue, particularly regarding the alleged government cover-ups mentioned by the witnesses. No specific deadlines or further hearings have been announced at this time.</p>
