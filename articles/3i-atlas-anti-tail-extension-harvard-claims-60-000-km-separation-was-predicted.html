      <h2>3I/ATLAS Anti-Tail Extension: Harvard Claims 60,000 Km Separation Was Predicted</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has made headlines as scientists claim its unique features, including a predicted 60,000 km separation, were anticipated by Harvard researchers. The comet was first detected by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025, and has since been the focus of extensive observation as it passes through our Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study an interstellar object. 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed object from outside our Solar System. Researchers are utilizing the Hubble Space Telescope to capture images and data, which could enhance our understanding of the building blocks of alien solar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected: July 1, 2025, in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2025, at a distance of 0.194 AU.</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest approach to the Sun): October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Hubble observations: Initial survey in July, follow-up on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet speed: Approximately 58 km/s (36 miles/s).</li>
    <li>Teardrop-shaped halo radius: About 40,000 km (24,855 miles).</li>
    <li>Anti-tail extension length: Approximately 60,000 km (37,282 miles).</li>
    <li>Next close approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026, at a distance of 0.357 AU.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, astronomers tracked its trajectory as it approached both Mars and the Sun. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, and reached perihelion on October 30, 2025. Hubble Space Telescope conducted an initial survey shortly after the comet's detection and returned for a follow-up observation on November 30, 2025, capturing its unique coma and anti-tail extension.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “As a result, background stars appear as streaks of light,” said scientists observing the comet through the Hubble Space Telescope.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The separation is in perfect agreement with the anti-tail extension of the teardrop shape in the new Hubble image,” noted Professor Avi Loeb from Harvard University.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous observations of interstellar comets have provided limited data, making 3I/ATLAS a unique subject for study. The current observations are significant for understanding the dynamics of such celestial bodies as they interact with our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue observing 3I/ATLAS as it moves out of the Solar System. The ongoing studies will focus on understanding the comet's disintegration process and the implications for the study of other interstellar objects.</p>
