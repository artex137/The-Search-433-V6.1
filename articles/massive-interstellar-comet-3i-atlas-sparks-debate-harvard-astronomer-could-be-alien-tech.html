      <h2>Massive Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Debate</h2>

<p>A newly discovered interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has entered the Solar System, having been first spotted on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. This marks the third known interstellar object, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unusual characteristics and the ongoing debate about its origins. Authorities, including astronomers and space agencies, are actively monitoring the comet, which is moving at high speed and is expected to provide insights into the formation of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS survey telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Estimated size: 5–20 km in diameter, mass over 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 60 km/s (over 210,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: ~240 million km (1.5 times the Earth-Sun distance)</li>
    <li>Active comet, venting gas and dust, shedding carbon dioxide and water vapor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope. Its trajectory indicated it originated from outside the Solar System, confirmed by observatories globally. The comet's high speed and large size have prompted extensive monitoring and analysis by astronomers worldwide.</p>

<p>As of now, 3I/ATLAS is on a path that will see it pass closest to Earth in late November 2025, when it will be positioned behind the Sun relative to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It poses no danger to our planet or any other planets in the Solar System,” confirmed the European Space Agency.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Beyond [its discovery] we do not know very much, and there are many efforts underway to observe this object with larger telescopes to determine composition,” said Larry Denneau, co-investigator of the ATLAS survey.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its size but also for its active venting of gases, which sets it apart from previous interstellar visitors. The discovery of interstellar objects has become more frequent, with three now catalogued in just a few years. Each provides a unique opportunity to study materials formed around distant stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories on Earth and space telescopes are preparing to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches, with multiple spacecraft set to track the comet, including NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA’s JUICE probe. Scientists are eager to gather data on its composition and activity during its closest approach to the Sun in late October 2025.</p>
