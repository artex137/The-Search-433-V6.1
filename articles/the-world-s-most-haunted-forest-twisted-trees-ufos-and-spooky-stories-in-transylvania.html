      <h2>‘The world’s most haunted forest’: twisted trees, UFOs and spooky stories in Transylvania</h2>

<p>The Hoia-Baciu Forest in Romania is often referred to as the world's most haunted forest, drawing visitors with its eerie reputation and claims of paranormal activity. Located on the outskirts of Cluj-Napoca, the forest has captured the imagination of many, with reports of strange occurrences dating back centuries. Tour guide Marius Lazin has led tours of the forest for over 12 years and describes it as the "Bermuda Triangle of Transylvania," where people have reportedly disappeared.</p>

<p>This forest has become a significant site for paranormal enthusiasts and researchers, particularly since a military technician photographed a UFO there in 1968. However, the forest faces threats from urban development as the city of Cluj-Napoca expands. Local advocates, including Lazin, hope to protect the area and promote it as a tourist destination through the Hoia-Baciu Project, which offers various activities to engage visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Hoia-Baciu Forest, near Cluj-Napoca, Romania</li>
    <li>Established as a tourist site: 1968, following UFO sightings</li>
    <li>Population of Cluj-Napoca: over 400,000</li>
    <li>Tour guide: Marius Lazin</li>
    <li>Activities offered: Night walks, yoga sessions, paranormal lectures, treasure hunts, escape games</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Reports of strange happenings in Hoia-Baciu date back centuries, tied to a local shepherd's mysterious disappearance along with 200 sheep.</p>
<p>In 1968, Emil Barnea, a military technician, captured photographs of what he described as a UFO hovering above a clearing in the forest, bringing international attention to the area.</p>
<p>In recent years, urban development pressures have increased as the city of Cluj-Napoca expands, prompting local advocates to push for the forest's protection.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Many came in here and never came out. But don’t worry, our tours have a 100% return rate,” said tour guide Marius Lazin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Many of the old researchers who investigated the forest ended up in psychiatric wards. Did the communist regime put them there? Or did something really happen to them, here in the forest?” Lazin added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Hoia-Baciu Forest has gained notoriety as a site for paranormal investigations, attracting yogis, shamans, and ufologists. Despite its popularity, the forest lacks official protection, apart from a few hectares of rare Mediterranean oak trees. The encroaching development in Cluj-Napoca poses a significant risk to the forest's unique ecosystem and cultural heritage.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Hoia-Baciu Project aims to raise awareness about the forest's value and encourage authorities to recognize its importance as a tourist attraction. Further initiatives may include promoting conservation efforts and increasing community engagement to protect the area from development threats.</p>
