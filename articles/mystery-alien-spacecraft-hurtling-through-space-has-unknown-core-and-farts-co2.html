      <h2>Mystery 'alien spacecraft' hurtling through space has unknown core and farts CO2</h2>

<p>A mystery object, designated 3I/ATLAS, is racing through space at speeds of 130,000 mph and emitting carbon dioxide, according to the James Webb Space Telescope. Discovered on July 1, 2023, by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, this interstellar object has sparked speculation about its origins and composition.</p>

<p>Experts have noted that 3I/ATLAS has an unusual core rich in carbon dioxide, which may indicate exposure to high levels of radiation. The findings have prompted calls for further observations to determine the object's properties. The object is currently heading towards the inner Solar System and is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun in October 2023.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: 130,000 mph</li>
    <li>First spotted: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Estimated size: 3.5 miles wide</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 2023</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 130 million miles</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 150 million miles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System on July 1, 2023. Subsequent analysis by the James Webb Space Telescope revealed its unique characteristics, including a high ratio of carbon dioxide emissions. The object is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun in October 2023, passing within the orbit of Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is difficult to imagine a natural process that would favour a plunge towards the inner solar system at 60 km per second. An alternative is that the object targets the inner solar system by some technological design,” said Avi Loeb, a theoretical physicist at Harvard University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“No-one knows where the comet came from. It's like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second. You can't project that back with any accuracy to figure out where it started on its path,” stated David Jewitt, an astronomer at UCLA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected by humanity, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Its unusual characteristics have led to debates about whether it could be more than a typical comet made of ice and dust.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts have called for further observations to determine the bulk nucleus composition of 3I/ATLAS. The results could have significant implications for our understanding of interstellar objects and their potential origins.</p>
