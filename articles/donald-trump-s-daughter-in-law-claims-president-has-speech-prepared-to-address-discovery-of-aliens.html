      <h2>Donald Trump's daughter-in-law claims president has speech prepared to address discovery of aliens</h2>

<p>During an appearance on the New York Post's Pod Force One podcast, Lara Trump, daughter-in-law of former President Donald Trump, claimed that he has a pre-written speech addressing the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life. The comments were made during an interview aired recently, but the exact date of the podcast is not disclosed.</p>

<p>This claim comes in the context of growing public interest in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and extraterrestrial life. Authorities and scientists have been investigating these topics, with recent discussions highlighting the lack of confirmed evidence of alien life despite ongoing speculation and conspiracy theories, particularly surrounding the Area 51 facility.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>

    <li>Former President Barack Obama has acknowledged the possibility of alien existence.</li>
    <li>The specific content and timing of Trump's purported speech remain unclear.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
