      <h2>Orionids 2025: Meteor shower caused by Halley's Comet peaks as two new comets cross the sky</h2>

<p>Skywatchers can expect a spectacular display as the annual Orionid meteor shower, produced by Halley's Comet, peaks from the night of Monday, October 20, to Tuesday, October 21, 2025. The Orionids coincide with the visibility of two newly discovered comets, Lemmon and SWAN, which will be at their brightest during this period.</p>

<p>The American Meteor Society has reported that the Orionid meteor shower runs annually from October 2 to November 7, with its peak occurring on October 20 and 21. This year, the new moon will provide a darker sky, enhancing visibility. Clear weather is necessary for optimal viewing of the meteors and the comets, which are expected to add to the celestial spectacle.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Orionid meteor shower peak: October 20-21, 2025</li>
    <li>Viewing window for comets: Best seen an hour and a half after sunset on October 20</li>
    <li>Meteor speed: 41 miles per second (66 kilometers per second)</li>
    <li>Expected meteors: Approximately 20 per hour</li>
    <li>Comet Lemmon (C/2025 A6) discovered in January 2025</li>
    <li>Comet SWAN (C/2025 R2) discovered in September 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Orionid meteor shower occurs annually, with this year's peak expected on the nights of October 20 and 21. The condition of the new moon will enhance the visibility of the meteors. Comet Lemmon was discovered in January 2025, while Comet SWAN was first observed in September 2025.</p>

<p>Both comets will be visible in the night sky shortly after sunset on October 20, before the peak of the meteor shower. Observers are encouraged to use stargazing binoculars for the best viewing experience.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA calls the Orionids one of the most beautiful showers of the year,” according to the American Meteor Society.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Orionid meteor shower is part of the fall "meteor season," which features several minor meteor showers. Halley's Comet, which produces the Orionids, was last seen in the inner solar system in 1986 and will next return in 2061. The other meteor shower associated with Halley's Comet is the Eta Aquariids, which peaks in April.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to prepare for optimal viewing conditions by finding dark locations away from city lights. As the date approaches, more detailed forecasts regarding weather conditions will become available.</p>
