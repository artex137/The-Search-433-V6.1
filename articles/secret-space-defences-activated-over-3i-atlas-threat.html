      <h2>Secret space defences activated over 3I/Atlas threat</h2>

<p>A series of large-scale planetary defence drills have taken place worldwide in response to the unpredictable behaviour of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The drills, which were conducted by various nations, have not resulted in any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>Governments have ramped up preparations due to the comet's erratic movements, prompting space analysts and defence experts to scrutinise the timing and scale of these exercises. The European Space Agency (ESA) initiated the drills, which involved multiple countries and a focus on advanced tracking technologies for potential threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Drills began on October 1, 2023, and involved multiple countries.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency conducted a three-day simulation.</li>
    <li>Japan coordinated an accelerated asteroid-impact drill.</li>
    <li>The US Space Force moved a high-altitude orbital tracking rehearsal from late 2026 to October 2023.</li>
    <li>Countries involved included Australia, South Korea, and Brazil.</li>
    <li>Drills focused on monitoring “high-velocity non-gravitationally accelerated objects.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 1, 2023, the European Space Agency commenced a three-day planetary defence simulation involving its complete defence system. Following this, Japan initiated its asteroid-impact drill on October 3, coordinating efforts among civilian, military, and commercial satellite operators. By October 5, the US Space Force conducted a high-altitude orbital tracking rehearsal, moving it forward from its original schedule.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, countries such as Australia, South Korea, and Brazil participated in joint exercises, focusing on data-sharing systems related to the monitoring of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The strange behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has prompted us to prepare more comprehensively than ever,” said an ESA spokesperson. “We must ensure our systems are equipped to handle unexpected scenarios.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The drills are unprecedented in scale and coordination among nations, prompted by the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. Scientists have observed non-gravitational accelerations and pulsations that defy natural models, raising concerns about the comet's potential to impact Earth.</p>

<p>Astrophysicist Avi Loeb has proposed that the comet may be accompanied by a swarm of compact objects, complicating global defence strategies. This hypothesis has led to a swift expansion of sensor networks and tracking platforms.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches on December 19, 2023, governments are expected to continue advancing their planetary defence capabilities. This may include further integration of classified sensor data and the development of new tracking technologies.</p>
