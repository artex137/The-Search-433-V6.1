      <h2>UFO interest proving a welcome distraction for Ryder Cup star Viktor Hovland</h2>

<p>Viktor Hovland has revealed that an interest in UFOs has helped him take his mind off golf as the Norwegian prepares for the Ryder Cup. The tournament is set to take place in Italy, where Hovland is part of Europe’s team aiming to retain their title following a successful victory in Rome two years ago.</p>

<p>This revelation highlights how athletes manage stress and maintain focus. Hovland's exploration of extra-terrestrial life has provided a mental diversion from the pressures of competitive golf. His remarks come as the Ryder Cup approaches, with players often seeking ways to cope with the intensity of the event.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, Viktor Hovland has developed an interest in UFOs, which he says has helped him cope with the pressures of professional golf. He has spent the last couple of years investigating the possibility of extra-terrestrial life.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Hovland reported that he had his best practice session in two years at the driving range, indicating a positive turn in his performance ahead of the Ryder Cup.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s just something that I’ve been into the last couple years,” Hovland said. “I think I’ve always been extremely into my golf and sometimes you just look at your golf swing and trying to practise hard and you don’t really get the results that you want, it can be quite frustrating.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I think it’s been one of those things that (has) kind of taken my mind off of golf a little bit,” he added. “And then the more you go into it, you just get more questions.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It looked definitely better than other swings that I’ve made lately. So really pleased with that,” Hovland noted about his recent practice session.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Hovland's interest in UFOs reflects a broader trend among athletes who seek alternative outlets to manage the mental strain of their sports. The pursuit of hobbies outside their primary focus can foster creativity and provide relief from performance pressure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
