      <h2>Anomalies of 3I/ATLAS, Organized by Likelihood</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has exhibited multiple anomalies as it approaches Jupiter, with significant implications for our understanding of such celestial bodies. These anomalies were detailed in a report published on November 23, 2025, by astronomer Avi Loeb.</p>

<p>This information matters because it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential origins. Authorities in the field of astronomy are currently analyzing these anomalies to determine if they suggest artificial technology or other unusual phenomena associated with the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of report:</strong> November 23, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Next major event:</strong> Encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Perijove distance:</strong> 53.445 million kilometers (± 0.06)</li>
    <li><strong>Mass comparison:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is approximately one million times more massive than 1I/‘Oumuamua</li>
    <li><strong>Gas plume composition:</strong> Contains more nickel than iron</li>
    <li><strong>Trajectory alignment:</strong> Aligned within 5 degrees of the ecliptic plane</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed to display a range of anomalies since its detection. Notably, the object showed a sunward jet during July and August, which continued through November 2025. This jet is not an optical illusion but rather a significant feature confirmed by imaging.</p>
<p>On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS is expected to encounter Jupiter, which will provide further opportunities for observation and analysis of its characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The forecasted perijove distance of 3I/ATLAS during its encounter with Jupiter is remarkable, particularly given its proximity to Jupiter’s Hills radius,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the significance of this match.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have been studied for their unique properties. However, 3I/ATLAS presents anomalies that suggest it may not merely be a random traveler from interstellar space but rather a targeted object. This raises questions about the frequency and nature of such objects entering the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, with a focus on gathering data that could clarify the nature of its anomalies. Further studies may lead to new insights into the origins of interstellar objects.</p>
