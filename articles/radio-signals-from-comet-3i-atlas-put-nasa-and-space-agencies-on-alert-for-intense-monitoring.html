      <h2>Radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS put NASA and space agencies on alert for intense monitoring</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has prompted a global scientific mobilization since its discovery on July 1, 2025. NASA has intensified its planetary surveillance and defense protocols following the comet's unusual radio signals and high-speed trajectory. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>The comet's journey through the solar system presents a significant scientific opportunity, according to NASA and international space agencies. They are collaborating to gather data on 3I/ATLAS to unlock mysteries about its composition and the star system from which it originated. This effort serves as a practical exercise for global detection and coordination networks to improve responses to future cosmic threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Speed exceeds 100,000 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2025, at approximately 27 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>Radio signals detected on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>Signals recorded at a frequency of 1.6 GHz, consistent with hydrogen emissions.</li>
    <li>NASA's planetary defense protocols activated for monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers identified comet 3I/ATLAS as the third confirmed interstellar object entering our solar system. Following its detection, NASA and other space agencies began preparing for extensive monitoring due to the comet's unique characteristics.</p>

<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected radio emissions from the comet, surprising researchers with their intensity and regularity. These findings prompted NASA to activate its planetary defense protocols.</p>

<p>The comet's closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, allowing scientists to gather further insights into its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activity is the result of natural processes,” said scientists analyzing the comet's signals. “The interaction between the comet’s material and the solar wind is generating the signals, but the strength detected suggests a composition or level of activity much more intense than that observed in other comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS differs from previous interstellar visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique composition and high speed present new opportunities for research in planetary science and radio astronomy.</p>

<p>This event serves as a real-time test for international planetary defense networks, enhancing collaboration between agencies like NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Continuous monitoring of 3I/ATLAS is essential for uncovering more about its internal structure and behavior. Data collected will inform future phases of the global observation campaign, with efforts to compare findings from this comet with previous interstellar objects.</p>
