      <h2>Report Claims 'Exotic Vehicle of Unknown Origin' Is Being Hidden in Secret Navy Hangar in Maryland</h2>

<p>The U.S. Navy has reportedly housed an “exotic vehicle of unknown origin” in a hangar at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, possibly since the 1950s. Anonymous sources linked to the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) have made these claims, which suggest ongoing analysis and reverse-engineering of technology from non-human crafts, or UFOs.</p>

<p>This matter has drawn attention due to the implications of military involvement with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities are now investigating the claims, which link surveillance activities at Pax River to both Chinese-operated drones and alleged extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland</li>
    <li>Sources: Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Liberation Times</li>
    <li>Timeframe: Allegations date back to the 1950s</li>
    <li>Key Figures: Luis Elizondo, Glenn Gaffney, Salvatore Pais</li>
    <li>Involvement: MITRE Corporation suggested as a defense contractor involved</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to sources, the CIA’s Directorate of Science and Technology may have recovered materials related to UFOs as early as the 1950s. The specific hangar at Pax River was designed for the transfer of this extraterrestrial technology, as stated by whistleblower Luis Elizondo.</p>
<p>Efforts to transfer the materials were reportedly blocked by Glenn Gaffney, the former CIA Director of Science and Technology. Surveillance activities have allegedly continued around the base, connecting these operations to testing of technology derived from the recovered materials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While employed at Pax River with NAVAIR, the aerospace engineer and inventor, Salvatore Pais, filed a series of patents describing unconventional propulsion and field effects – including a triangular or diamond-shaped craft that he claimed could produce anti-gravity – like behavior.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The Liberation Times learned that the CIA’s Directorate of Science and Technology originally controlled the materials.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to these allegations, there has been increasing public interest in UAPs, particularly following congressional hearings and reports from various military branches. The connection between military activities and unidentified aerial phenomena has prompted calls for greater transparency and investigation.</p>
<p>The claims surrounding Pax River add to a growing narrative of potential government secrecy regarding UFO-related technology and its implications for national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims regarding the hangar and the alleged UFO technology are ongoing. Authorities are expected to assess the validity of these allegations and determine the next steps in addressing the reported surveillance activities and technology testing at Pax River.</p>
