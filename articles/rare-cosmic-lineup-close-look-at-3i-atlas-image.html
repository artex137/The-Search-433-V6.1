      <h2>Rare cosmic lineup: Close look at 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On January 22, 2026, astronomers captured a rare alignment of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which reached a proximity of 0.69 degrees with the Earth-Sun axis. The images were taken at 13:40 UTC using Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument, providing a unique opportunity to study the comet's characteristics.</p>

<p>This alignment is significant because it allowed scientists to observe a brightness surge in 3I/ATLAS, which is influenced by the composition and structure of the particles released by the comet's jets. Harvard University’s Professor Abraham Loeb and Dr. Mauro Barbieri of the INAF-Padova Observatory highlighted the importance of studying interstellar objects for understanding materials from other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> January 22, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Time:</strong> 13:40 UTC</li>
    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> 0.69 degrees with Earth-Sun axis</li>
    <li><strong>Instrument:</strong> Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3</li>
    <li><strong>Observation by:</strong> Man-To Hui, Shanghai Astronomical Observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 22, 2026, Earth passed nearly directly between the Sun and the comet 3I/ATLAS. During this time, Hubble's WFC3 captured images of the comet, revealing a system of jets. The brightness surge observed was linked to the particles shed by the comet.</p>

<p>Professor Loeb noted that the images processed by his collaborator, Toni Scarmato, revealed a system of four jets, including a prominent anti-tail directed towards the Sun and Earth, along with three mini-jets positioned at angles of 120 degrees from each other.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This rare alignment resulted in a brightness surge whose magnitude and growth rate are dictated by the composition and structure of the particles shed by jets of 3I/ATLAS,” said Professor Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When the Hubble images from the January 22, 2026 alignment were processed by my collaborator Toni Scarmato, the residuals showed the system of 4 jets,” Professor Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this observation, interstellar objects like 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have been studied, but neither displayed significant traces of gas or dust. The unique conditions during the January 22 alignment may not repeat for decades, making this observation particularly valuable for astronomical research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the images and data collected from the Hubble observations is expected to continue, helping scientists understand the physical properties of 3I/ATLAS and its jets. This research may provide insights into the nature of interstellar comets and their origins.</p>
