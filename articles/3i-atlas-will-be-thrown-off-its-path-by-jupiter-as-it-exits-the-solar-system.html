      <h2>3I/ATLAS Will Be Thrown Off Its Path by Jupiter as It Exits the Solar System</h2>

<p>A new study has revealed that comet 3I/ATLAS will be significantly impacted by Jupiter's gravitational force as it exits the solar system. This encounter is expected to alter the comet's trajectory on March 16, 2026. The study highlights the comet's journey and its origins, but no injuries or fatalities are associated with this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it provides insights into the comet's path and its interaction with Jupiter. Researchers are preparing for the comet's close approach, which will offer a unique opportunity for observation. The Juno spacecraft will be positioned to study 3I/ATLAS during this period, potentially yielding valuable data about the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will encounter Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory will be altered due to Jupiter's gravitational pull.</li>
    <li>The close approach will occur within 0.355 astronomical units (au) of Jupiter's Hill radius.</li>
    <li>The best observation window for 3I/ATLAS is from March 9 to 22, 2026.</li>
    <li>The Juno spacecraft is set to study the comet during its close approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The study has analyzed the long-term orbital path of comet 3I/ATLAS, which is believed to originate from the Sagittarius constellation and head towards the Gemini constellation. Researchers utilized 500 statistical clones of the comet to forecast its trajectory over the next century.</p>

<p>On March 16, 2026, the comet will pass near Jupiter, which will exert a significant gravitational influence, possibly altering its course as it exits the solar system. The period from March 9 to 22, 2026, will be critical for observations, with the Juno spacecraft optimally positioned to gather data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The distance of the comet 3I from Jupiter is very close to the Hill radius (0.355 au) of Jupiter. Therefore, there could be a stronger perturbation from Jupiter compared to Mars,” the study authors wrote.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study builds on previous observations of 3I/ATLAS and its trajectory, which has already been influenced by Mars. However, the upcoming encounter with Jupiter is expected to have a more pronounced effect. The researchers noted that non-gravitational forces, such as outgassing and radiation pressure from the Sun, could also influence the comet's path as it approaches Jupiter.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet nears its encounter with Jupiter, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and prepare for the observation period in March 2026. The data collected by the Juno spacecraft may provide further insights into the comet's characteristics and origin.</p>
