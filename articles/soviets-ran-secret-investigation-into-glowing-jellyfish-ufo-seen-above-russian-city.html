      <h2>Soviets ran secret investigation into glowing 'jellyfish' UFO seen above Russian city</h2>

<p>A 'jellyfish' UFO, described as being crowned by shifting coloured lights, hovered over the city of Nalchik in southern Russia for over an hour on February 13, 1989, before disappearing, according to newly released Soviet-era documents. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to the sighting.</p>

<p>The newly shared documents, translated into English and published by journalist George Knapp, detail how officials in the former USSR recorded and assessed unidentified flying objects even as they publicly dismissed claims of alien craft. This archive, spanning around 70 pages, has become accessible to the public after being removed from Russia in the early 1990s.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: February 13, 1989</li>
    <li>Location: Nalchik, southern Russia</li>
    <li>Duration of sighting: More than one hour</li>
    <li>Witness descriptions: Jellyfish-like form, luminous streaks, humanoid figures</li>
    <li>Archive span: 1970s and 1980s</li>
    <li>Published by: Journalist George Knapp</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 13, 1989, witnesses in Nalchik reported seeing a large, jellyfish-like object in the sky. The UFO was said to remain visible for over an hour before vanishing. Other accounts from the same era include sightings in Kazakhstan where campers reported tall, dark figures near wooded areas.</p>

<p>The documents detail various sightings logged by civilians, soldiers, and technical specialists. They include procedures for taking testimony, filing reports, and exploring possible explanations for these phenomena. While no definitive proof of extraterrestrial activity is provided, the archive indicates a systematic approach to documenting cases that did not conform to established explanations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The files reference sightings logged by civilians, soldiers, and technical specialists, as well as the procedures for taking testimony, filing reports, and weighing possible explanations,” said Knapp.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This release follows a history of Russian UFO sightings, including a notorious incident in 1993 when state media claimed the military downed an extraterrestrial craft in Siberia. Reports indicated that this led to an encounter with humanoid entities, which resulted in the transformation of nearby soldiers into stone pillars.</p>

<p>During the Cold War, concerns about foreign technology and experimental aircraft contributed to the interest in these phenomena. Many entries in the archive suggest Earth-bound explanations, such as atmospheric effects or sensor malfunctions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The newly available documents are expected to prompt further investigation into the historical context of UFO sightings in the Soviet Union, as well as ongoing discussions about unexplained aerial phenomena around the world.</p>
