      <h2>3I/ATLAS Sparks Doomsday Fear: Physicist Warns 'Depart in Peace or in Pieces'</h2>

<p>A physicist has raised alarms about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may be changing its path to approach Earth. Dr. John Brandenburg posted a warning on X (formerly Twitter), stating, “Depart in Peace or Depart in Pieces.” His claims have sparked concern, but NASA has confirmed 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to the planet.</p>

<p>This situation has drawn attention due to the object's unique status as only the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system. NASA has stated that the comet will make a close approach, but it will remain far away from Earth, calming fears about a potential collision.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First spotted: 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 170 million miles (270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Projected closest point to the Sun: 30 October 2025</li>
    <li>Flyby of Mars: Early October 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size: Between 1,444 feet (440 metres) and 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometres)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Dr. John Brandenburg first posted his alarming message on X on an unspecified date, warning of a potential threat from 3I/ATLAS. NASA, in response, released a fact sheet confirming the comet's safe trajectory and distance from Earth. The object was first detected on 1 July 2025 and is currently being tracked by NASA's Hubble and Webb telescopes.</p>

<p>As of now, scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is an active comet with an icy nucleus, not an asteroid, and its trajectory does not indicate any change that would bring it closer to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away,” NASA stated. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Approach Earth & there will be War and God is with US,” Dr. Brandenburg warned in his post.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident highlights the ongoing public concern regarding interstellar objects and their potential impact on Earth. Previous reports of cometary threats have often led to widespread panic, despite reassurances from scientific communities. The stark contrast between sensational claims and official data underscores the importance of relying on established scientific findings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars and the Sun. The agency has committed to providing updates and reassurances to the public regarding the comet's trajectory and safety.</p>
