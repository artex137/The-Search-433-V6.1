      <h2>Running Late - Today the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Will Approach Earth at a Minimum Distance</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is set to approach Earth today at a minimum distance, according to specialists. The object, moving at approximately 240,000 kilometers per hour, is believed to be a large comet comparable in size to Manhattan. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>This flyby presents an opportunity for scientists to gather unique data on interstellar bodies. Official representatives from NASA and leading astronomical centers have noted that while the object is being closely monitored, it is currently classified as a natural comet. Meanwhile, some experts have raised questions about its trajectory and behavior, suggesting the need for further study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 240,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Size: Comparable to the area of Manhattan</li>
    <li>Approach: Minimum distance to Earth today</li>
    <li>Status: Under observation by NASA and astronomical centers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been tracked since its discovery, moving through the Solar System in transit. As it approaches Earth today, scientists continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior closely.</p>

<p>Harvard University professor Avi Loeb has expressed concerns about anomalies in the object's motion that standard models cannot fully explain. He has suggested the possibility of an artificial origin, which has ignited discussions regarding humanity's preparedness for potential extraterrestrial technologies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The probability of a dangerous scenario is extremely low; however, the absence of ready mechanisms for response makes the topic a subject of scientific discussion,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA representatives maintain that “all current observations indicate the natural, cometary nature of 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in 3I/ATLAS has been heightened by both scientific inquiry and speculation from public figures. However, scientists stress that the object remains an astronomical phenomenon, and its flyby may yield valuable information about the composition and properties of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and studies of 3I/ATLAS will continue as it passes Earth, with an emphasis on understanding its trajectory and behavior.</p>
