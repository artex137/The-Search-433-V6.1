      <h2>What’s happening to the ‘Close Encounters’ farmhouse in Fairhope?</h2>

<p>The fate of the farmhouse featured in the 1977 film “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” remains uncertain as its developer has until November 21, 2024, to provide updates on its relocation. The farmhouse, located on Alabama Highway 181 in Fairhope, was the site of the movie's alien abduction scene involving a young boy.</p>

<p>The situation has garnered public interest, with Fairhope City Council President Jack Burrell acknowledging the curiosity surrounding the farmhouse. The city has authorized the house to be moved nearly a year ago, but no progress has been reported. Hunter Simmons, the City of Fairhope’s Planning Director, stated that the developers must secure a building permit within one year of the council’s approval to commence the project. If they fail to do so, they may request an extension.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Alabama Highway 181, Fairhope, Alabama</li>
    <li>Developer: Jade Consultants and Encounters Development</li>
    <li>Deadline for updates: November 21, 2024</li>
    <li>Approval for relocation: Granted nearly one year ago</li>
    <li>Current status: No permit applications submitted</li>
    <li>Nearby construction: New Sherwin Williams paint shop and an office building</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2023, Fairhope City Council approved the relocation of the farmhouse. The developers have one year from that date to secure a building permit. As of now, no permit applications have been submitted, and the deadline for updates is set for November 21, 2024.</p>

<p>City officials have noted that communication has occurred between the development team and the city, although no specific details regarding the relocation have been disclosed. Meanwhile, construction projects are ongoing in the vicinity of the farmhouse.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I think people are interested to know what is going on,” said Fairhope City Council President Jack Burrell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I have not had anyone voice disappointment that it hasn’t been done. Any calls I have received were mainly just curiosity,” said Erik Cortinas, the city’s building official.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We do not want to rush such an endeavor,” said Hunter Simmons, Planning Director of Fairhope.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The farmhouse has become a point of interest due to its connection to a popular science-fiction film, which has led to discussions about preservation and potential tourism benefits. The film, directed by Stephen Spielberg, featured the farmhouse in a pivotal scene but is set in Muncie, Indiana. The building's preservation could draw attention from fans of the movie and contribute to local tourism.</p>

<p>Historically, the region has seen a significant increase in population and development since the film was shot in the 1970s. Baldwin County's population has more than doubled since that time.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The developers are expected to communicate their intentions regarding the farmhouse's relocation by the November 21 deadline. City officials hope for a successful preservation effort and potential future use of the site.</p>
