      <h2>Four orbiters over Mars and a Jupiter mission can intercept 3I/Atlas before it slips away</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/Atlas, which has sparked debate among scientists about its true nature, is set to pass near Mars in October 2023, with multiple spacecraft positioned to study it during its flyby. The object has exhibited unusual movement, speed, trajectory, and brightness, leading to speculation about whether it is a comet or something more exotic.</p>

<p>Authorities and scientists are focusing on this opportunity to gather data on 3I/Atlas as it approaches Mars. Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor, has proposed using existing missions, such as NASA's Juno and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, to intercept and study the object. He believes that analyzing 3I/Atlas could provide insights into its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas is approaching Mars, with a close encounter expected on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object will be 29 million kilometres from Mars on October 3 and 2.7 million kilometres within a few days.</li>
    <li>Nasa's Juno spacecraft, launched in 2011, could potentially intercept 3I/Atlas if it accelerates by 2.6 km/s on September 14, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and China's Tianwen-1 mission can use their high-resolution cameras to observe 3I/Atlas.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas has reportedly brightened five times in a few weeks, a phenomenon that challenges typical comet behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in 2019 and has since been observed exhibiting unusual characteristics. On October 3, 2023, it will pass within 29 million kilometres of Mars, with its distance decreasing rapidly over the following days. The next opportunity for Juno to intercept 3I/Atlas will occur on September 14, 2025, if it can adjust its trajectory appropriately.</p>

<p>Loeb has suggested that if Juno can make a minor adjustment, it may have a chance to rendezvous with 3I/Atlas on March 14, 2026. Meanwhile, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will be ready to capture images of the object as it approaches Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The close encounter of 3I/ATLAS to Jupiter provides a rare opportunity to shift Juno from its current orbit around Jupiter to intercept the path of 3I/ATLAS at its closest approach to Jupiter,” said Avi Loeb in a blog post.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Using Juno’s scientific instruments to probe the nature of 3I/ATLAS from a close distance could yield significant findings,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has raised questions since its discovery regarding its origins and nature. While most scientists believe it is a comet, some, including Loeb, have speculated about the possibility of it being an alien spacecraft. Its recent increase in brightness has further intrigued researchers, prompting efforts to study it closely.</p>

<p>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and other missions have been operational for several years, providing valuable data about Mars and its atmosphere. The ability to pivot these missions to observe 3I/Atlas represents a significant opportunity for enhanced understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the October flyby approaches, scientists will prepare their instruments for observations. Following the encounter, data collected may help clarify the nature of 3I/Atlas. Further adjustments to Juno’s orbit may be planned for its potential rendezvous in 2026.</p>
