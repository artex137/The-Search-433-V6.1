      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS: Martian Probe Captured It at an Unprecedented Moment</h2>

<p>The UAE spacecraft "Al-Amal" has captured unique images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approached the Sun in October 2025. This observation marks a significant event in astronomical research, as ground-based telescopes were unable to detect the comet due to its position behind the Sun.</p>

<p>The UAE Space Agency has reported that the data collected from the "Al-Amal" probe provides insights into the chemistry of another star system. The observations indicate that 3I/ATLAS was disintegrating under the Sun's influence, allowing scientists to study its chemical composition, which differs from that of comets within the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet approached the Sun at a speed of over 200,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>The "Al-Amal" spacecraft observed the comet in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Unique data were collected during the comet’s closest distance to the Sun.</li>
    <li>The probe detected hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide emissions from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. By October 2025, the comet approached the Sun, during which the "Al-Amal" spacecraft captured images of its disintegration. The probe utilized its EXI and EMUS instruments to collect data, which included the detection of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide.</p>

<p>This observation was significant as it provided a rare glimpse into the comet’s chemical makeup, reflecting the conditions of its origin in another star system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The uniqueness of this observation lies in the fact that we were able to see 3I/ATLAS at the moment of its actual disintegration near the Sun,” said a representative from the UAE Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, ground-based telescopes had limited visibility of interstellar comets, particularly when they are positioned behind the Sun. The "Al-Amal" probe, designed to study the Martian atmosphere, was fortuitously positioned to observe 3I/ATLAS, highlighting the potential for spacecraft designed for one purpose to contribute to other areas of scientific inquiry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are expected to conduct a more detailed analysis of the data collected from the observations. Further results will be published soon, contributing to the understanding of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>
