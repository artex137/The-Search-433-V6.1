      <h2>NASA debunks alien spacecraft rumours on interstellar "comet" 3I/ATLAS; shares images</h2>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has dismissed claims that interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft, confirming that it is a natural comet from beyond our solar system. NASA made the announcement in a blog post on November 20, stating that the comet will pass closest to Earth on December 19 at a distance of about 170 million miles.</p>

<p>This clarification matters as speculation about 3I/ATLAS has circulated widely on social media. NASA is monitoring the comet closely, with a record number of spacecraft and telescopes involved in its observation. The agency aims to study the object’s composition and trajectory, which may provide insights into interstellar objects compared to those formed within our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1 by NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, at approximately 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA is observing the comet with 12 spacecraft and space telescopes.</li>
    <li>Notable missions involved include Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, and Perseverance rover.</li>
    <li>Observations will continue as the comet travels past Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA discovered 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2023, using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, speculation about the comet's nature began to circulate among conspiracy theorists and enthusiasts. NASA confirmed its natural composition on November 20, 2023, and reported its closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2023.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to this announcement, NASA has engaged in a comprehensive observation campaign involving multiple spacecraft and telescopes to gather data on the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA confirms it is a natural celestial object, currently being observed by a record number of spacecraft and telescopes,” the agency stated in its blog post.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS marks it as the third interstellar object ever detected. Previous observations of interstellar objects have generated interest in their characteristics and origins, contributing to ongoing research in planetary science and astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to gather data on 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, aiming to maximize understanding of this rare visitor and its implications for interstellar research.</p>
