      <h2>Weird Wobbling Jets: Science Baffled by Comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual wobbling jets and a rare tail pointing toward the Sun, leaving scientists puzzled since it passed Earth. This phenomenon was captured in recent images, prompting further investigation into the comet's characteristics.</p>

<p>The strange behaviour of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it challenges existing knowledge of cometary behaviour and may indicate the presence of exotic materials from another star system. Authorities and researchers are now closely examining these findings to understand their implications for comet science.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed Earth; specific date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>New images reveal wobbling jets and a tail directed towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>Scientists suggest these features may indicate exotic materials.</li>
    <li>Current research efforts are ongoing to investigate these phenomena.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, first observed on its journey through the solar system, has raised questions among astronomers following its recent close pass of Earth. The comet's unique behaviour, including the wobbling jets and unusual tail orientation, has prompted scientists to analyse its composition and trajectory.</p>

<p>Images captured during this period have sparked discussions about the comet's origins and the materials involved. As research continues, experts aim to gain insights into the broader implications for cometary studies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These strange characteristics challenge what we know about comets,” a scientist involved in the research stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time a comet has shown unusual behaviour. Previous instances have prompted scientists to reevaluate their understanding of these celestial bodies. The study of comets like 3I/ATLAS is crucial for advancing knowledge about the solar system and potential materials from beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to investigate the characteristics of comet 3I/ATLAS, focusing on its composition and potential implications for understanding other celestial phenomena.</p>
