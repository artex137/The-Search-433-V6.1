      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS to make its closest approach to Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles. The comet, which was first spotted by Chile's ATLAS telescope in July 2025, is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system.</p>

<p>This event has garnered attention from both astronomers and the public, as it presents a rare opportunity to observe an object from beyond our solar system. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Minor Planet Center have confirmed the comet's trajectory, which comes from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Speed at discovery:</strong> Roughly 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus size:</strong> Estimated between 1,400 feet and 3.5 miles wide</li>
    <li><strong>Tracking tools:</strong> Small telescopes or binoculars recommended</li>
    <li><strong>Observation period:</strong> Visible in pre-dawn skies near Virgo and Leo through spring 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. NASA released images of the comet on November 19, 2025, showing its active coma and tails. On November 30, Hubble Space Telescope captured the comet from about 178 million miles away. Between November 2 and 25, ESA's JUICE probe near Jupiter also captured images of the comet during its hyperactive phase after a close approach to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We certainly haven’t seen any technosignatures,” said Nicola Fox, Associate Administrator at NASA, addressing claims that the comet might be an alien probe.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object after 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Its classification as a comet distinguishes it from rocky asteroids due to its icy nucleus and gas and dust coma. NASA has actively monitored the comet and dismissed conspiracy theories suggesting it is an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its activity and trajectory. Live tracking will be available through NASA’s Eyes on the Solar System and the Virtual Telescope Project livestream.</p>
