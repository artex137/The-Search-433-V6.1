      <h2>Obama Clarifies Comments on Aliens Following Viral Interview</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has clarified his recent comments regarding the existence of aliens during an interview with Brian Tyler Cohen. His remarks have generated significant attention, prompting Obama to address his statements on social media.</p>

<p>The clarification is significant in light of ongoing public interest in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and extraterrestrial life. As discussions around these topics intensify, authorities and public figures are increasingly called upon to provide clarity and context.</p>

<p>Obama's clarification followed the viral nature of his original statement, which did not include immediate follow-up questions from Cohen.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really,”</blockquote>
