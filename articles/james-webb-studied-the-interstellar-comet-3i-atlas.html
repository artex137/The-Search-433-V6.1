      <h2>James Webb studied the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and SPHEREx to study the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered in early July. This comet has become only the third object of interstellar origin found in the Solar System.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS is significant for the scientific community as it provides valuable insights into the composition and origins of interstellar objects. The analysis has indicated that the comet likely originates from the thick disk of the Milky Way, suggesting it is billions of years older than our Solar System. Two scientific articles based on the observations are already available online.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object in the Solar System.</li>
    <li>JWST captured images of the comet's coma at a distance of 3.32 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The coma primarily consists of carbon dioxide (CO₂), with traces of water, carbon monoxide, and carbonyl sulfide detected.</li>
    <li>The ratio of carbon dioxide to water is one of the highest observed in comets.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx also detected carbon dioxide in the comet’s coma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023, prompting increased interest from scientists. NASA subsequently utilized the JWST and SPHEREx to observe the comet's coma and analyze its composition.</p>
<p>During observations, JWST captured images of the coma while it was located 3.32 AU from the Sun. The analysis revealed a high ratio of carbon dioxide to water, indicating unique conditions in the comet's formation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The analysis provides insight into the nature of the interstellar visitor and a better understanding of the conditions in which it formed,” NASA officials stated regarding the study of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins a small group of interstellar objects identified in the Solar System, enhancing our understanding of celestial bodies beyond our own. The study of such comets aids in piecing together the history and evolution of the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from JWST and SPHEREx to further understand the implications of their findings on the composition and origins of interstellar comets.</p>
