      <h2>QuickCheck: Did a 'UFO' shaped cloud appear in Kota Kinabalu?</h2>

<p>A massive UFO-shaped cloud appeared in the sky over Kota Kinabalu on Sunday, November 16. The unusual cloud formation, resembling a flying saucer, caught the attention of residents in the city and prompted many to capture photos and videos of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>This sighting matters as it highlights a rare meteorological occurrence. Authorities have noted that while lenticular clouds can form near Mount Kinabalu, their appearance at a lower altitude in the city is uncommon. The unique conditions that produced the cloud have sparked public interest and excitement.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: Sunday, November 16</li>
    <li>Location: Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia</li>
    <li>Time of sighting: Around 8:40 AM</li>
    <li>Type of cloud: Lenticular cloud formation</li>
    <li>Visibility: Clearly visible from city area</li>
    <li>Associated risks: Possible turbulence for aircraft, but no severe weather</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Sunday morning, November 16, at approximately 8:40 AM, a lenticular cloud formation resembling a disc was spotted in Kota Kinabalu. This cloud formation is typically found near mountainous regions but was unusually visible from the city.</p>

<p>The cloud maintained its position, characteristic of lenticular clouds, which do not move like regular clouds as long as wind conditions remain constant. This phenomenon generated excitement among local residents, many of whom documented the sighting through photos and videos.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unique appearance of the cloud is a result of moist air flowing over barriers, creating wind vortices that produce these layered clouds,” an expert explained.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While they may resemble UFOs, lenticular clouds are simply a meteorological phenomenon and pose no danger to people on the ground,” the expert added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Lenticular clouds are known for their saucer-like appearance and can often lead to comparisons with unidentified flying objects. These clouds are formed under specific atmospheric conditions and are typically associated with stronger winds and turbulence in the surrounding area.</p>

<p>Prior incidents of unusual cloud formations have generated similar public interest, although such formations are generally considered benign in terms of weather impact.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No investigations or charges are pending regarding the cloud formation, as it is recognized as a normal meteorological event. Residents are encouraged to observe and appreciate such phenomena while remaining aware of any potential aviation advisories related to wind conditions.</p>
