      <h2>December 2025 cosmic trio: Moon-Jupiter duo, Geminid meteors, interstellar comet Earth visit</h2>

<p>As December 2025 approaches, sky watchers can anticipate a cosmic trio featuring a conjunction of the Moon and Jupiter, the Geminid meteor shower, and a close encounter with the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The events will take place in the night skies over various locations, with significant celestial occurrences on December 7, December 13, 14, and December 19.</p>

<p>This cosmic spectacle is significant for both amateur and professional astronomers. Authorities, including NASA and various observatories, are preparing to observe and study the interstellar comet closely as it approaches Earth. The event presents an opportunity to gain insights into the nature and origin of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conjunction of Moon and Jupiter:</strong> December 7, best viewed at dusk until midnight.</li>
    <li><strong>Geminid meteor shower peak:</strong> December 13 and 14, with up to 120 meteors per hour in optimal conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>3I/ATLAS closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, approximately 170 million miles away.</li>
    <li><strong>Observation tools:</strong> Telescope with at least a 30cm aperture recommended for viewing 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 7, the Moon and Jupiter will appear close together in the eastern sky after sunset. This conjunction will continue until midnight, allowing observers to view the celestial pairing with the naked eye or binoculars.</p>

<p>The Geminid meteor shower will peak on the nights of December 13 and 14, providing a vibrant display for those in areas with dark skies.</p>

<p>Finally, on December 19, the comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth, allowing scientists and astronomers to study it more closely using spacecraft and ground-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is one of the most intriguing events of 2025,” said a NASA representative. “We are excited to observe its close approach and learn more about its characteristics.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb stated, “Based on the anomalies demonstrated by 3I/ATLAS, it may represent an alien probe, though further observation is necessary.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has generated considerable interest due to its interstellar origin. NASA's analysis has confirmed it is a comet, although some experts, like Loeb, have proposed alternative theories regarding its nature.</p>

<p>The Geminid meteor shower is an annual event that is regarded as one of the best meteor showers of the year, known for its bright and colorful meteors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As December unfolds, NASA and other space agencies will deploy a fleet of spacecraft and telescopes to study 3I/ATLAS during its close approach on December 19. Observations will aim to clarify the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>
