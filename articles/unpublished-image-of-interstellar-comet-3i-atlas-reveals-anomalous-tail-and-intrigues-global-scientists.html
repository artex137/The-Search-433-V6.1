      <h2>Unpublished image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals anomalous tail and intrigues global scientists</h2>

<p>A new image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by Japanese astronomer <strong>Koichi Itagaki</strong> on November 22, 2025, has shown unprecedented features that are intriguing the scientific community. The image reveals an anomalous tail structure, differing significantly from known patterns of comets originating from our Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery is essential as it may redefine current models about the composition of small celestial bodies that travel through deep space. Research teams around the world have begun analyzing the comet's unique properties, which could provide valuable data on the formation of stellar systems. Preliminary findings suggest that the comet's composition is distinct from local comets, indicating a different origin and formation process.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Date of image capture: November 22, 2025</li>
  <li>Observer: Koichi Itagaki</li>
  <li>Comet designation: 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li>Speed: 57 km/s</li>
  <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: approximately 1.4 astronomical units (AU)</li>
  <li>First identified: July 2025</li>
  <li>Analyzing agencies: Various global research teams</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the astronomical survey system ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) first identified comet 3I/ATLAS in Chile. The object was confirmed to have an interstellar origin due to its hyperbolic trajectory and high speed. It reached its perihelion in October 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.4 AU from the Sun.</p>

<p>On November 22, 2025, Koichi Itagaki captured a detailed image of the comet, revealing significant anomalies in its tail structure. Ongoing analysis from various global research teams has commenced to further understand the comet’s unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “This unusual morphology suggests that 3I/ATLAS has a distinct composition and origin, offering valuable data on the formation of other stellar systems,” said a spokesperson from the research team analyzing the comet.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. While 1I/’Oumuamua exhibited no visible cometary activity, 2I/Borisov behaved like a typical Solar System comet. The unique properties of 3I/ATLAS challenge existing assumptions about the formation processes of comets across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing research will focus on the chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS, with scientists searching for spectral signatures that could reveal more about its origin. Data collected during its passage through the Solar System will continue to be analyzed throughout 2025, providing a unique opportunity to study primitive material from another star system.</p>
