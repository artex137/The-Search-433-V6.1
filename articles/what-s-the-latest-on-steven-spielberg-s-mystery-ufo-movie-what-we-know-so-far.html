      <h2>What's The Latest On Steven Spielberg's Mystery UFO Movie? What We Know So Far</h2>

<p>Steven Spielberg is developing a new UFO-themed film, with production taking place in Atlanta, northern New Jersey, and Long Island, New York. The project, which has been referred to as The Dish, has no confirmed title or plot details at this time.</p>

<p>This project is significant as it marks Spielberg's return to the science fiction genre, where he has previously made iconic films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Spielberg’s longtime collaborator, David Koepp, has written the script based on an original story by Spielberg. Koepp described the film as an emotional experience that combines spectacle with human emotion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Filming began under the codename "Non-View" in winter 2023.</li>
    <li>Principal photography wrapped in late May 2025.</li>
    <li>The film features an ensemble cast including Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, Eve Hewson, and Henry Lloyd-Hughes.</li>
    <li>Universal Pictures has scheduled a wide theatrical release for June 12, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In spring 2023, Variety reported that Spielberg developed an original story focusing on UFOs. Koepp was brought on to write the script, with Spielberg heavily involved in the process.</p>
<p>Filming commenced in winter 2023, taking place across multiple locations. By late May 2025, principal photography concluded.</p>
<p>This past summer, Spielberg showcased mysterious footage during a dedication event at Universal Studios, hinting at a conspiracy theme without revealing specific sci-fi elements.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “What he does so brilliantly is he combines a vast spectacle with really honest human emotion—unlike, I think, any other director. It's a very emotional experience, this movie,” Koepp told Deadline in June.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Spielberg has a long history with the science fiction genre, having created classic films that explore themes of alien encounters. This film represents his first writing credit since A.I. Artificial Intelligence over two decades ago.</p>
<p>The film's cast and production values suggest a significant investment in the project, indicating Universal Pictures' confidence in the film's potential success.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The film is currently in post-production, with the release scheduled for June 12, 2026. Further details about the plot and promotional materials are expected to be revealed as the release date approaches.</p>
