      <h2>Submarine worker's chilling claim about Navy UFO logbooks tracking 'fast movers' in ocean</h2>

<p>A former submarine worker has claimed that the US Navy has kept logbooks documenting mysterious fast-moving unidentified objects in the world's oceans. The claims come in light of a report from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) that revealed 21 unexplained UFO sightings last year, which the US government acknowledged after Congress received the report.</p>

<p>This matter has garnered attention as it raises questions about the nature of unidentified aerial or submerged objects (UASO) and the government's monitoring of such phenomena. The AARO has stated that they are actively working with intelligence and scientific partners to analyze these cases, which include various eyewitness testimonies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Former submarine worker claims logbooks document UFO sightings.</li>
    <li>AARO reported 21 unexplained UFO sightings last year.</li>
    <li>Some sightings included a green fireball and strange noises.</li>
    <li>AARO found no evidence of extraterrestrial activity or advanced foreign technologies.</li>
    <li>Mike Gold has urged NASA to lead investigations into UFOs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Last year, a document emerged revealing 21 unexplained UFO sightings, prompting the US government to acknowledge these findings after Congress received the report from AARO. The report included eyewitness testimonies that had been investigated.</p>

<p>Recently, a Reddit user named Dabier shared his discussion with a retired Cold War submariner about "fast movers," a term for unidentified objects detected by military systems. The submariner indicated that unidentified contacts were logged in a specific section of their records.</p>

<p>The serviceman described some entries as "really weird," noting occurrences of unusual noises and fast-moving objects that could not be attributed to known vessels.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>AARO stated: "It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology."</blockquote>
<blockquote>AARO added: "None of these resolved cases substantiated advanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Mike Gold cautioned: "The truth is out there," urging NASA to lead investigations into suspected UFOs.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Reports of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), often referred to as UFOs, have included various sightings that raise questions about their nature. While some incidents have been explained as mundane objects like balloons or birds, others remain unresolved, such as the notorious 'GOFAST' footage involving a U.S. Navy F/A-18 jet.</p>

<p>The AARO continues to investigate these cases, working closely with the Intelligence Community and Science and Technology partners to understand the reported anomalies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>AARO will notify Congress immediately if any cases indicate a breakthrough in foreign adversarial aerospace capability. Investigations into the unexplained sightings continue as authorities seek to understand the nature of these phenomena.</p>
