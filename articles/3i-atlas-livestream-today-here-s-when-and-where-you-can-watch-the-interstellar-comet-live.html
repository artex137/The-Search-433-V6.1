      <h2>3I/ATLAS livestream today: Here’s when and where you can watch the Interstellar comet live</h2>

<p>The third interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, will be livestreamed by the Virtual Telescope Project tonight at 11:15 PM ET as it moves through the Virgo constellation. The comet has garnered attention for its unusual behaviour and trajectory, recently passing Jupiter, Venus, and Mars. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This livestream is significant for sky enthusiasts and scientists alike. The comet's unusual path has sparked debate within the astronomical community, with experts calling for more transparent data sharing to better understand its nature. NASA is also set to release detailed images of 3I/ATLAS, captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which may help clarify its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Livestream time: 11:15 PM ET, today</li>
    <li>Livestream platform: YouTube, via the Virtual Telescope Project</li>
    <li>Current brightness: Estimated at magnitude +10.9</li>
    <li>Current location: Virgo constellation</li>
    <li>Images captured by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter between October 1 and 7</li>
    <li>Possible release of images: As early as next week</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has made headlines recently due to its unusual trajectory. It passed by several planets, including Jupiter, Venus, and Mars, prompting discussions within the astronomical community.</p>
<p>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of the comet between October 1 and 7. NASA is preparing to release these images, which may provide more insight into the comet's characteristics.</p>
<p>Tonight's livestream at 11:15 PM ET will offer a live telescopic view of 3I/ATLAS, allowing viewers worldwide to observe the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Withholding scientific data for bureaucratic reasons only increases confusion,” said astrophysicist Avi Loeb. “Transparent data sharing is critical for understanding the object’s true nature.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet, following previous discoveries that have intrigued astronomers. The ongoing debate surrounding its trajectory and behaviour reflects broader trends in the field of astronomy, particularly regarding data transparency and public engagement.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to release the detailed images of 3I/ATLAS next week. The livestream tonight will provide an opportunity for both amateur and professional astronomers to observe the comet in real-time.</p>
