      <h2>10 ways Harvard scientist says mysterious space object breaks the rules with 0.005% chance of coincidence</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard physicist, has identified ten ways that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS deviates from typical behaviour. The object was first detected by a NASA-funded telescope in July 2023 and made its closest approach to the Sun last week, passing within 210 million kilometres. It is scheduled for its nearest encounter with Earth on December 19, 2023, when it will be 270 million kilometres away.</p>

<p>This research highlights the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and has attracted attention from the scientific community. Loeb has invited Kim Kardashian to join the investigation after she expressed skepticism about the 1969 moon landing. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First spotted:</strong> July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> Last week, 210 million km away</li>
    <li><strong>Nearest encounter with Earth:</strong> December 19, 2023, 270 million km away</li>
    <li><strong>Chance of unusual behaviour:</strong> 0.005% for specific timing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, NASA's telescope first detected the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The object made its closest approach to the Sun last week, passing at a distance of 210 million kilometres. It is expected to pass Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of 270 million kilometres.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has since detailed the ten anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, suggesting that its behaviour is statistically improbable. He has also engaged the public by inviting Kim Kardashian to participate in the investigation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away," said NASA, clarifying the object's status.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object, following ʻOumuamua and Borisov. Unlike typical comets, which are primarily composed of ice, 3I/ATLAS exhibits unusual gas composition and behaviour. Loeb's observations suggest that its characteristics could challenge current understandings of comet formation and behaviour.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS over the coming months to gather more data and insights regarding its unusual properties and trajectory.</p>
