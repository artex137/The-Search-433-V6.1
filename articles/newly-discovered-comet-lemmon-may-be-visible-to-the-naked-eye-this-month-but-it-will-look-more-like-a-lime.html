      <h2>Newly Discovered Comet Lemmon Approaches Earth This Month</h2>
<p>A newly discovered comet, designated C/2025 A6 (Lemmon), is set to make a close approach to Earth on October 21, 2023, coming within 56 million miles (90 million kilometers) of the planet. The comet may be visible to the naked eye, displaying a lime-green glow, researchers have said.</p>

<p>This event provides an opportunity for skywatchers to observe a comet that has largely gone unnoticed until now. Comet Lemmon is a non-periodic comet, which means it has a variable orbital period that spans over a millennium. Currently, it is estimated to orbit the sun every 1,350 years and spends most of its time in the Oort Cloud, the outer region of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet Lemmon was first observed on January 3, 2023, at Mt. Lemmon SkyCenter in Arizona.</li>
<li>The comet travels at speeds up to 130,000 mph (209,000 km/h).</li>
<li>It will reach its closest point to Earth on October 21, 2023.</li>
<li>On November 8, 2023, it will reach perihelion, its closest point to the sun.</li>
<li>It may achieve a maximum brightness of around magnitude 4, making it potentially visible without equipment.</li>
<li>The comet can be spotted in the constellation Lynx, between Jupiter and the Big Dipper.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon was first detected on January 3, 2023, by astronomers at Mt. Lemmon SkyCenter. Observations indicated it was moving toward the inner solar system. As it approaches the sun, it is expected to brighten due to its expanding coma, which reflects more sunlight.</p>
<p>The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on October 21, followed by perihelion on November 8, 2023. Its trajectory may be altered due to its recent close flyby of Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet is developing very nicely and it is already an impressive object, well-placed for observation in the morning sky," said Nick James, director of the Comet Section of the British Astronomical Association.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It is definitely worth getting up for!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon joins a series of notable comets observed in recent years, including C/2022 E3 and 12P/Pons-Brooks. These comets have also exhibited green hues due to the presence of diatomic carbon in their comas. The increasing visibility of such comets has sparked interest among both amateur and professional astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet Lemmon approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its brightness and trajectory. Observers are encouraged to look for the comet in the morning sky, particularly in mid-October when it is expected to reach peak visibility.</p>
