      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Gemini North Captures Interstellar Guest Emitting Reactive Carbon</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar visitor, is emitting reactive carbon as it approaches the outer edges of our Solar System. The comet, which was first detected on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), has undergone a significant transformation since its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it sheds light on the chemical processes that occur in interstellar objects. The data gathered from this comet offers valuable insights into the composition and formation of celestial bodies from other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on 29 October 2025, at a distance of approximately 12.9 million miles (0.139 AU).</li>
    <li>Gemini North Telescope in Maunakea, Hawaii, captured recent images showing a faint green glow from the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at speeds of approximately 150,000 miles per hour (67 km/s).</li>
    <li>Nickel has been detected in the comet, but iron is absent.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency plans to launch a 'comet interceptor' in 2029 to study future interstellar visitors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Subsequent observations were made using several major telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. The comet reached its solar conjunction on 21 October 2025. It made its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025, marking a key moment in its journey.</p>

<p>Recent imaging from the Gemini North Telescope revealed a shift in the comet's colour from red to green, attributed to the evaporation of diatomic carbon as the comet's icy core heated up.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Sharing an observing experience in some of the best conditions available gives the public a truly front-row view of our interstellar visitor,” said Bryce Bolin, a research scientist from Eureka Scientific. “Allowing people to see the raw process helps to demystify science, providing transparency to the study of such a fascinating object.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS continues a trend of increased interest in interstellar objects since the detection of 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These findings have prompted further exploration and study of celestial bodies that originate outside our Solar System.</p>

<p>The absence of iron in 3I/ATLAS is noteworthy, as most Solar System comets maintain a 1:1 ratio of nickel and iron. This suggests that 3I/ATLAS may have formed in a different chemical environment than those of our own planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey back into interstellar space, scientists will continue to observe and analyze the comet's characteristics. Plans for the European Space Agency's 'comet interceptor' are underway, with a launch scheduled for 2029 to capture future interstellar visitors.</p>
