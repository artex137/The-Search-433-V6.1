      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS displays luminous structures directed towards the Sun in solar alignment images</h2>

<p>A detailed analysis of images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed structured and directional activity in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a rare solar alignment in January 2026. The comet, discovered in July 2025, has exhibited bright patterns directed towards the Sun, while its nucleus remains unresolved. The observations occurred around the time of opposition alignment, allowing improved visibility of phenomena activated by solar radiation.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers as it raises questions about the internal composition and mechanisms of material release from the comet. Authorities, including NASA and international space agencies, continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely as it moves away from the inner Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred in October 2025, 1.36 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Images captured on January 14, 2026, show extensive halo patterns with pronounced elongation towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently moving away from the inner Solar System.</li>
    <li>Current magnitude of 3I/ATLAS is around 16.7, requiring professional equipment for observation.</li>
    <li>January 22 alignment positioned the comet 3.33 AU from the Sun and 2.35 AU from Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 and confirmed as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic orbit. It reached perihelion in October 2025, positioned at a distance of 1.36 AU from the Sun. Observations in November and December 2025 indicated sunward elongations, but the January alignment significantly enhanced the clarity of structured details.</p>

<p>On January 14, 2026, images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed jets and a coma with a teardrop shape, extending over millions of kilometers. The comet's activity includes symmetrical jets and an asymmetrical coma, raising questions about its internal mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations show unique patterns that differ from traditional cometary tails, indicating possible rotation and asymmetric sublimation,” said an astronomer involved in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit, with an eccentricity greater than 6, confirms that it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. The comet's relative velocity of approximately 60 km/s suggests it originated in the thick disk of the Milky Way, potentially over 7 billion years ago.</p>

<p>Previous observations have shown that interstellar comets often display unique behaviors compared to those originating from our Solar System, making this an important area of study for astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves further from the inner Solar System. Ongoing studies will focus on analyzing variations in its activity and understanding the formation and distribution of volatiles in interstellar bodies.</p>
