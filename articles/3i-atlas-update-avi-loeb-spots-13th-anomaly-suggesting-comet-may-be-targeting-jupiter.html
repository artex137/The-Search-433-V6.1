      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Avi Loeb Spots 13th Anomaly Suggesting Comet May Be Targeting Jupiter</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has identified a 13th anomaly associated with the comet 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may be on a trajectory towards Jupiter. This discovery was made public on July 1, 2025, when the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, detected the object crossing into our solar system.</p>

<p>The implications of this anomaly are significant, as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including NASA, have monitored the comet closely, stating it poses no threat to Earth. However, Loeb's findings have sparked debate in the scientific community regarding whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet or an artificial probe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object detected: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Initial detection: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026, at 53.445 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Velocity: Approximately 60 km/s</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: Over 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Observational campaign involved: NASA's Psyche, Lucy spacecraft, Hubble, and JWST</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2025, pre-discovery observations of 3I/ATLAS were made by Caltech's Zwicky Transient Facility. This was followed by its detection by the ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025. The comet's perihelion on October 30, 2025, brought it within 1.35 AU of the Sun, allowing for extensive observation by various space agencies.</p>
<p>On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS is predicted to make its closest approach to Jupiter, which has raised concerns about its trajectory and potential implications.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It behaves like a comet,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA's Associate Administrator, emphasizing the lack of clear technosignatures associated with the object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has ignited discussions similar to those surrounding previous interstellar objects like 'Oumuamua and Borisov. While the scientific community remains divided, Loeb's claims about the comet's anomalies challenge traditional views of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers are preparing for 3I/ATLAS's closest pass to Earth in mid-December 2025, which could provide further insights into the object's nature and trajectory.</p>
