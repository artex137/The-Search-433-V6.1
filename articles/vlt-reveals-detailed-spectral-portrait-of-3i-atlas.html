      <h2>VLT Reveals Detailed Spectral Portrait of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>An international team of astronomers has captured the most detailed spectroscopic data of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. The observations reveal the presence of atomic nickel and cyanogen gas emissions from the comet, which is currently traversing our Solar System. This significant discovery was published on December 10, 2025, in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>

<p>The findings are important as they provide insights into the chemical and physical processes of distant stellar systems. Authorities, including the European Southern Observatory (ESO), are utilizing this data to better understand the composition of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Date:</strong> December 27, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Sun:</strong> 4.51 astronomical units (AU) at discovery</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments Used:</strong> VLT’s X-Shooter and Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES)</li>
    <li><strong>Publication:</strong> Astrophysical Journal Letters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS using the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope. The comet arrived from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and was observed at a heliocentric distance of 4.51 AU. Between July and August 2025, a high-resolution spectroscopy campaign was conducted as the comet approached the Sun, allowing researchers to gather critical data on its composition.</p>

<p>On December 27, 2025, the detailed spectral portrait of 3I/ATLAS was captured using Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), marking a significant milestone in the study of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Characterizing the volatile composition of interstellar objects passing through the Solar System provides a unique window onto the chemical and physical processes operating in distant stellar systems,” said Dr. Rohan Rahatgaonkar from the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS continues to exhibit Ni without Fe through perihelion, it will constitute the first clear case where interstellar cometary metal emission is decoupled from classical refractory release,” the authors said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study builds on previous discoveries of interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These earlier findings revealed a diversity in the characteristics of interstellar bodies. While ‘Oumuamua appeared inert, 2I/Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide and complex ices. 3I/ATLAS adds to this understanding by showcasing a dust-rich body that reveals molecular signatures of both familiar cometary behavior and new physics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. Further observations may provide additional insights into the comet's composition and behavior, contributing to the ongoing study of interstellar objects in our Solar System.</p>
