      <h2>NASA confirms discovery of unusual comet C/2025 D1 (Gröller) 2 billion km from the Sun</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed the discovery of comet C/2025 D1 (Gröller), an unusual cosmic object located approximately 2 billion kilometers from the Sun. The discovery was reported by Hannes Groeller, an astronomer at the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, based on images obtained from the 2.25-meter Bok telescope at Kitt Peak on February 20, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The significance of this discovery lies in its unprecedented distance from the Sun, making it a rare find in astronomical studies. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun, or perihelion, on May 19, 2028. NASA plans to conduct further observations to better understand the origins of this celestial object and the implications for our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: February 20, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Kitt Peak, Arizona, USA</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: Approximately 2 billion kilometers</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: May 19, 2028</li>
    <li>Estimated aphelion: 56,600 AU</li>
    <li>Magnitude: Expected to not exceed magnitude 18</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 20, 2025, Hannes Groeller reported the discovery of comet C/2025 D1 using the Bok telescope at Kitt Peak. The discovery is notable as it marks the first time a comet has been identified at such a significant distance from the Sun. Following this, NASA has initiated plans for ongoing observations of the comet.</p>

<p>In relation to other celestial discoveries, NASA has also noted the detection of comet 3I/ATLAS, reported on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. This comet is categorized as interstellar due to its hyperbolic orbital path.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The rarity of this discovery is significant. Never before has a comet appeared so far from the Sun,” Groeller stated. “Continued study holds the promise of deciphering the origins of creation and explaining random phenomena within our solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of comet C/2025 D1 adds to the growing list of unusual celestial objects observed by astronomers. Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in 2025, follows the interstellar objects 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which were discovered in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Each of these discoveries has contributed to our understanding of the solar system and the universe beyond.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa plans to conduct further observations of comet C/2025 D1 to gain insights into its characteristics and origins. However, its low brightness may complicate detailed spectroscopic studies in the future.</p>
