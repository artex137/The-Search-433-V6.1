      <h2>NASA Missions Monitor 3I/ATLAS: Explosion Of The Ion Tail Grows</h2>

<p>NASA and ESA missions are currently monitoring interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1 ATLAS) as its ion tail has grown significantly longer and more structured, according to a new image captured by the Virtual Telescope Project. The image was taken remotely from Manciano, Italy, at 11:31 p.m. EDT on 10 November (0431 GMT on 11 November).</p>

<p>The observation is part of a coordinated effort to study the comet as it travels through the inner solar system. The increasing activity of 3I/ATLAS provides vital information about its composition and the conditions of its original planetary system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected.</li>
    <li>The image was captured using 18 separate 120-second exposures.</li>
    <li>Conditions for the observation included a bright Moon at 61% illumination, located 70 degrees away.</li>
    <li>The ion tail is roughly 0.7 degrees across the sky.</li>
    <li>Previous observations have shown the tail fanning out into four or five distinct jets.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes have provided crucial data on the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023. Since then, numerous observations have been made to track its activity as it approaches the Sun. The latest image was taken on 10 November 2023, revealing a significant increase in the length and structure of the ion tail compared to earlier observations.</p>

<p>In late October and early November, two spacecraft, ESA's Hera and NASA's Europa Clipper, were predicted to have flown through the comet's expansive tail, indicating its growing activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Exploiting the unusual good weather of this season, we imaged the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS again, recording a much more developed ion tail,” said Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Looking at the picture, we see how the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS is clearly showing better and better,” Masi added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being bright enough to be studied in detail, unlike its predecessors, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its observations offer insights into its composition, including a possible high fraction of carbon dioxide ice, which may provide clues about the conditions in its original planetary system.</p>

<p>This growing activity is part of a larger scientific campaign involving multiple observatories, both ground-based and space-based, to gather as much data as possible on this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Virtual Telescope Project will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, providing updates on its activity and further insights into its characteristics and origins.</p>
