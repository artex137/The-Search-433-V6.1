      <h2>3I/ATLAS is Finally Broadcasting? New Findings Break the Internet — What We Know</h2>

<p>Recent claims about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have sparked widespread interest, with reports suggesting it may be transmitting radio signals. These claims emerged after sensitive radio telescopes, including MeerKAT in South Africa, allegedly detected unusual emissions from the comet. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>This matter has captured the attention of both scientists and the public, prompting NASA and various observatories worldwide to initiate monitoring missions of 3I/ATLAS. The claims suggest that the comet could be emitting signals that challenge conventional understandings of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, designated as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>Detection Date: First identified on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Location: Observations conducted globally, with significant data from MeerKAT in South Africa.</li>
    <li>Claims of emissions have led to monitoring by NASA and other observatories.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects include ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Following its detection, claims emerged regarding unusual radio emissions. These claims prompted immediate monitoring efforts from NASA and other observatories.</p>
<p>Reports circulated that MeerKAT had detected steady emissions, leading to viral discussions online about the possibility of extraterrestrial origins. However, scientific investigations have indicated that these emissions are consistent with natural processes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Telescopes like MeerKAT have indeed observed radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS. However, these are not broadcasts of intelligent or alien origin,” a spokesperson for the Breakthrough Listen project stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “What has been observed is perfectly fitting with what we might expect from a natural comet,” the spokesperson added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. Previous objects, such as ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also stirred public and scientific interest, but investigations have typically shown them to be natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Continued observations of 3I/ATLAS are expected as scientists seek to understand its behavior and emissions further. Investigations by projects like Breakthrough Listen will continue to monitor for any signs of artificial origin, although no such evidence has been found to date.</p>
