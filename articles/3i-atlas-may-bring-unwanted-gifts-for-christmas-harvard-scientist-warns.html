      <h2>3I/ATLAS may bring 'unwanted gifts' for Christmas, Harvard scientist warns</h2>

<p>A Harvard astrophysicist has raised concerns about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is approaching Earth and may deliver "unwanted gifts" during its closest approach on 19 December. The object, larger than Manhattan, is currently surrounded by jets that have sparked debate about its nature.</p>

<p>The scientific community is closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to determine whether it is a natural comet or a piece of extraterrestrial technology. The MeerKAT Radio Telescope in South Africa has made significant discoveries regarding the object, detecting radio absorption lines that provide hard data for analysis. Authorities and scientists are preparing to further investigate the object as it nears Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2023</li>
    <li>Recent images captured: 8 November 2023</li>
    <li>Detection of hydroxyl radicals: 24 October 2023</li>
    <li>Radio frequencies detected: 1.665 and 1.667 gigahertz</li>
    <li>Speed of 3I/ATLAS: 98 kilometres per second</li>
    <li>Next significant event: Close pass of Jupiter on 16 March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 24 October 2023, the MeerKAT Radio Telescope detected radio absorption lines from 3I/ATLAS, marking the first successful radio observation of the object. This followed previous unsuccessful attempts in September. On 8 November 2023, new images revealed a complex jet structure surrounding the object, leading to speculation about its nature.</p>

<p>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth is scheduled for 19 December 2023. Following this, the object will pass close to Jupiter on 16 March 2026, coming within 53 million kilometres of the gas giant.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It would be easy to test whether 3I/ATLAS is natural or technological by measuring the outflow velocity, mass flux and composition of its jets during the coming month.” 
    <br/>— Dr. Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “C/2025 V1 is not related to 3I/ATLAS if it did not employ non-gravitational propulsion.” 
    <br/>— Dr. Avi Loeb, on another interstellar object
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest due to its unique characteristics that challenge current scientific understanding. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have also raised questions about their origins, but 3I/ATLAS presents a more complex case with its jet structures.</p>

<p>The detection of hydroxyl radicals from 3I/ATLAS is a breakthrough, as it aligns with calls from the scientific community to monitor the object for emissions, especially in light of its proximity to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its jets and emissions to determine its nature. NASA's Juno spacecraft is scheduled to search for low-frequency radio emissions during the object’s close pass of Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
