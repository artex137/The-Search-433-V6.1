      <h2>US Navy Recorded 21 Unexplained UFO Encounters in Hidden Logs, Insider Alleges</h2>

<p>A former U.S. Navy submarine technician has claimed he discovered internal records detailing 21 unexplained encounters involving unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). The incidents, tracked by the military for years, include high-speed objects moving through ocean waters. The claim follows a 2024 government disclosure regarding the encounters.</p>

<p>This disclosure is significant as it highlights ongoing military investigations into UAPs, which are defined as sightings of objects or events that cannot be logically explained. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has been tasked with analyzing these encounters, following a request from Congress for findings on UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>21 unexplained UAP encounters documented</li>
    <li>Reported by a former U.S. Navy submarine technician</li>
    <li>Records compiled by the Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)</li>
    <li>Incidents include high-speed objects detected by military sensors</li>
    <li>Notable sightings include the Navy’s “GOFAST” incident in 2016</li>
    <li>Congress has requested ongoing updates from AARO</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2024, a report was released detailing 21 unexplained encounters involving UAPs, prompted by a Congressional inquiry into military tracking of such phenomena. The report summarized testimonies and incidents that remained unresolved.</p>

<p>In 2016, a widely publicized incident known as “GOFAST” involved a fighter jet from the USS Theodore Roosevelt capturing videos of unidentified objects flying at high speeds off the east coast of Florida.</p>

<p>The AARO, established to analyze these encounters, has stated that while many sightings can be attributed to known objects, a small percentage remain unexplained and warrant further investigation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,” said Dr. Jon Kosloski, director of the AARO. “None of these resolved cases substantiated advanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Former NASA Associate Administrator for Space Policy Mike Gold urged Congress to take the matter seriously, stating, “the truth is out there,” and emphasized NASA's capability to track and uncover the truth behind these UAPs.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Reports of U.S. military tracking unidentified objects have circulated for decades. Previous sightings have included descriptions of green fireballs and anomalous shapes, yet many have been attributed to known sources, such as balloons or satellites. The recent focus on UAPs reflects a growing interest in understanding these phenomena.</p>

<p>As investigations continue, the military has committed to notifying Congress if significant evidence emerges regarding UAPs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO will continue its analysis of the 21 unexplained encounters. Congressional leaders expect further updates as investigations progress and will monitor any developments that suggest major findings.</p>
