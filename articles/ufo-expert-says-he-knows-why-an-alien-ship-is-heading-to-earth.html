      <h2>Harvard professor proposes alien origin of interstellar object approaching Earth</h2>

<p>A Harvard professor has proposed that an interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS, currently speeding toward Earth, may have been sent by aliens to assess human intelligence. Professor Avi Loeb has urged for action to be taken before the object enters the solar system, suggesting that its unusual behavior warrants further investigation.</p>

<p>This matter has drawn attention due to the potential implications for humanity and our understanding of extraterrestrial life. While many experts have dismissed Loeb's theories, he maintains that a closer examination of 3I/ATLAS could yield significant insights. Authorities, including NASA, are evaluating his recommendations for possible scientific engagement with the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Current Speed:</strong> 221,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Proposed Juno spacecraft approach:</strong> March 14, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Recommended acceleration for Juno:</strong> 2.6 km/s on September 14, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance to Mars on October 3:</strong> 29 million km</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> 2.7 million km within several days of October 3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to Professor Loeb, calculations indicate that if NASA's Juno spacecraft can accelerate by 2.6 km/s on September 14, 2025, it could rendezvous with 3I/ATLAS on March 14, 2026. This proposed encounter would allow scientists to investigate the object closely.</p>
<p>Additionally, Loeb noted that 3I/ATLAS will approach Mars on October 3, 2023, reaching a distance of 29 million kilometers before coming as close as 2.7 million kilometers in the following days.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The close encounter of 3I/ATLAS to Jupiter provides a rare opportunity to shift Juno from its current orbit around Jupiter to intercept the path of 3I/ATLAS at its closest approach to Jupiter," said Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The peculiar behavior of 3I/ATLAS, generating its own light, raises questions that merit further investigation," Loeb added in his blog.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this, many interstellar objects have been observed, but 3I/ATLAS stands out due to its unusual characteristics. While some researchers classify it as a comet, Loeb argues that its light emission differs from typical comet behavior.</p>
<p>The conversation surrounding extraterrestrial life has intensified in recent years, with multiple sightings and reports drawing interest from both the scientific community and the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies are expected to evaluate Loeb's proposals and determine the feasibility of the suggested missions to investigate 3I/ATLAS further.</p>
