      <h2>NASA unveils never-before-seen images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS for the first time</h2>

<p>NASA has released unprecedented images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, confirming its origin outside the solar system. The images reveal detailed features of the comet, including its nucleus, coma, and tail, and provide insights into its composition and evolution.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it offers a rare opportunity to study material not influenced by the Sun's environment. According to NASA, the data is already contributing to new models developed by international teams, who aim to better understand the processes of planetary formation and compare 3I/ATLAS with other interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is confirmed to be of interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>The images provide insights into the comet's nucleus, coma, and tail.</li>
    <li>Data is being used in new models by international research teams.</li>
    <li>NASA utilized various filters and wavelengths for detailed imaging.</li>
    <li>Findings contribute to understanding dust and gas distribution from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has been studying interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS since its discovery. The comet's trajectory was confirmed as being from outside the solar system, prompting further investigation. The release of the images marks a significant advancement in the study of interstellar objects, with findings shared among global researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This rare visitor offers a unique opportunity to study material not influenced by the Sun's environment," NASA stated in their announcement.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The release of images from comet 3I/ATLAS follows the detection of other interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua. These studies contribute to a growing body of research aimed at understanding the formation of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue analyzing the data from 3I/ATLAS to enhance models of planetary formation and further investigate the comet's characteristics as more information becomes available.</p>
