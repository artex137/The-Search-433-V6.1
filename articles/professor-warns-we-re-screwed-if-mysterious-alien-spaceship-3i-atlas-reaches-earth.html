      <h2>Professor warns 'we're screwed' if mysterious 'alien spaceship' 3I/ATLAS reaches Earth</h2>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, warning it could signal an unprecedented "black swan event" if it originates from an advanced civilization. The comet, which is roughly the size of Manhattan, is expected to come closest to Earth on 19 December 2025, approximately 270 million km away.</p>

<p>Loeb, who heads Harvard's Galileo Project, has identified ten anomalies that suggest the object may not be a purely natural phenomenon. He has urged global agencies to remain vigilant and prepare for potential extraterrestrial implications. NASA has reportedly activated its planetary defense network in response to the comet's unusual characteristics, although the agency has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no immediate threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It will pass closest to Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach will be approximately 270 million km away.</li>
    <li>The comet has displayed a gas cloud rich in carbon dioxide and low in water.</li>
    <li>NASA and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) are monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>Loeb suggests the comet may be as ancient as 7 billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope system. Following its discovery, the comet exhibited unusual features, including a significant brightness change and a blue hue distinct from the sun.</p>

<p>On 29-30 October 2025, the comet will make its closest approach to the sun. It is expected to re-emerge from behind the sun by early December 2025, after which scientists intend to closely monitor its trajectory and any unusual changes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re screwed if this object comes from a more technologically advanced civilisation,” said Loeb. “Global agencies must stay alert and consider strategies to employ should the comet reveal an artificial origin.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no immediate threat to Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 1977 “Wow! Signal” is often referenced in discussions about potential extraterrestrial communication. This powerful radio signal, detected by the Big Ear radio telescope, lasted 72 seconds and has yet to be explained. While some researchers support Loeb's theories, many stress that current data indicates a natural origin for 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>The comet's peculiar trajectory and chemical makeup have led to increased scrutiny from the scientific community and space agencies. The IAWN aims to enhance global tracking and measurement of small celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor the trajectory and brightness of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observations are expected to provide further insights into the comet's nature and any potential implications for planetary defense.</p>
