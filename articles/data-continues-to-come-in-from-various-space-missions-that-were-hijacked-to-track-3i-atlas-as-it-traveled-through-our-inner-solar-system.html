      <h2>Data Continues To Come In From Various Space Missions That Were Hijacked To Track 3I/ATLAS As It Traveled Through Our Inner Solar System</h2>

<p>As the comet 3I/ATLAS entered the inner solar system, space agencies around the world redirected their instruments to gather data from October 1 to November 25, 2025. The European Space Agency (ESA) and the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) have successfully collected significant information about the comet, which is the third confirmed interstellar object tracked entering our solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers, as it provides a unique opportunity to study an interstellar object. The data collected from 3I/ATLAS helps improve tracking methods for potential threats to Earth from space. The ESA has indicated that this information will also aid in the development of future missions, such as the planned NEOMIR mission, designed to monitor areas of space hidden from Earth's view.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system.</li>
    <li>ESA gathered data from October 1 to October 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>JUICE began observing the comet on November 2 and continued until November 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than typical targets.</li>
    <li>Data from ESA has improved tracking precision by about 10 times.</li>
    <li>JUICE is using a low-bandwidth antenna to send data back to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 1, 2025, the ESA began collecting data from its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter as 3I/ATLAS approached the sun. The orbiter, positioned on the opposite side of the sun, provided valuable observations despite its limitations. By October 7, the ESA had completed its data collection.</p>

<p>On November 2, 2025, JUICE commenced its observations of 3I/ATLAS. The mission continued to gather information until November 25, 2025, sending data back to Earth using a low-bandwidth antenna due to operational constraints.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target,” said Nick Thomas of the ESA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS is part of ongoing efforts to enhance capabilities for tracking interstellar objects. The data collected not only aids in understanding the comet but also serves as a test for future missions aimed at monitoring potential threats to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As data from JUICE continues to be transmitted, astronomers will analyze the information to refine tracking methods. The ESA's NEOMIR mission is in development, which aims to provide advanced warning of potential threats from hidden areas of space.</p>
