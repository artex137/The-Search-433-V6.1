      <h2>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS makes mysterious move toward the sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar visitor known as 3I/ATLAS has reached its closest point to the sun today, approximately 126 million miles away, marking a critical milestone in its journey through our solar system. As the comet approaches perihelion, scientists are eager to determine whether it will behave like a typical comet or display signs of artificial construction.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it could reveal whether 3I/ATLAS is an ordinary comet or a spacecraft. Authorities, including astronomers and physicists, are closely monitoring the object for any unusual behavior as it nears the sun. Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has called this moment the "acid test" for 3I/ATLAS, which could provide insights into its true nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 126 million miles from the sun.</li>
    <li>The object weighs around 33 billion tons and has a flat, pancake-like shape.</li>
    <li>It is covered in nickel, with little to no iron detected in its composition.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass within 58 million miles of Venus on November 3.</li>
    <li>The object is projected to reach its closest point to Earth, approximately 165 million miles away, on December 19.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, key events have unfolded:</p>
<ul>
    <li>October 29, 2025: 3I/ATLAS reaches its closest point to the sun.</li>
    <li>November 3, 2025: The object is set to pass near Venus.</li>
    <li>December 19, 2025: 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "For a spacecraft, perihelion is the optimal time for either acceleration or deceleration by an impulse from an engine, thanks to the gravitational assist from the sun," said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has sparked debate among scientists regarding its origins and composition. While some studies suggest it is a unique comet formed in a distant solar system rich in carbon dioxide ice, others, including Loeb, argue that its characteristics hint at artificial construction.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS for signs of unusual behavior as it approaches Venus and Earth. Further analysis will take months to determine how the object reacts after passing perihelion.</p>
