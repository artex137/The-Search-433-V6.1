      <h2>The Mystery of the U.S. Navy: 200 Sailors Witness UFO over Aircraft Carrier in 2004</h2>

<p>In early 2004, approximately 200 sailors aboard the USS Ronald Reagan observed a bright orange orb, described as a "UFO sphere," hovering over the aircraft carrier's flight deck. The incident, which has remained unexplained, occurred during the sailors' watch in the eastern part of the United States. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it raises questions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the U.S. government's response to such incidents. Documentarian Dave S. Beti has been investigating this case for years and has interviewed many witnesses who claim to have seen the orb. Beti has noted that attempts to clarify the event have been hindered by a lack of official confirmation and transparency from military authorities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in early 2004.</li>
    <li>Approximately 200 sailors witnessed the event.</li>
    <li>The object was described as a 40-foot diameter orb.</li>
    <li>Former ship advisor Carol Olesiak was on watch from 8 PM to midnight.</li>
    <li>The orb reportedly hovered for four hours over the USS Ronald Reagan.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon has faced criticism for its handling of UAP reports.</li>
    <li>The Office for Anomalous Phenomena Research was established in 2022.</li>
    <li>From May 1, 2023, to June 1, 2024, 757 UAP reports were received.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early 2004, sailors on the USS Ronald Reagan observed a bright orange orb over the flight deck. The sighting lasted approximately four hours, with many witnesses recalling the event vividly.</p>
<p>Documentarian Dave S. Beti began investigating the sighting years later, interviewing former sailors about their experiences. Beti has highlighted the lack of official acknowledgment of the incident and its implications for national security.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Pentagon established the Office for Anomalous Phenomena Research to address UAP, following mounting criticism regarding their response to such sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I can still vividly imagine that object, even though it's been 18 years. All I know is that it was something I couldn't explain,” said Patrick Gokey, a sailor who witnessed the incident.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The government knows more than they are telling us,” stated Derek Smith, another former sailor who believes the object was not a weather balloon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I was asked not to record the incident,” said Carol Olesiak, who noted the orb's resemblance to the biblical “burning bush.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is not isolated; it contributes to a growing body of UAP sightings reported by military personnel. The establishment of the Office for Anomalous Phenomena Research indicates a shift in how the U.S. government is approaching these reports. Critics argue that the government has not adequately addressed the implications of UAP for national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Beti continues to investigate the 2004 sighting and encourages sailors with more information to come forward. The Pentagon's ongoing efforts to track UAP may lead to further revelations about unidentified aerial phenomena in the future.</p>
