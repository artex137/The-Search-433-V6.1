      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas halts near Mars, baffling scientists</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has stunned scientists by halting its movement for days in Mars’ orbit, about 27 million kilometers from the planet, in October 2025. The event, which defies known laws of physics, has raised questions about the forces at play in space.</p>

<p>This unusual phenomenon has prompted the scientific community to seek explanations, as it may indicate unknown forces affecting celestial bodies. Telescopes and Martian probes have captured detailed images of the comet, which has turned into a natural laboratory for researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of event: October 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: approximately 27 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated age of the comet: 10 billion years</li>
    <li>Diameter of the nucleus: between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Next perihelion: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Expected passes: Venus in November 2025, Jupiter in March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, the comet 3I/Atlas was detected by NASA equipment and was observed to stop moving while in Mars’ orbit. This event has been confirmed by NASA, which ruled out instrumental errors. The comet remained nearly motionless relative to background stars, a rarity for its trajectory.</p>
<p>During its period of immobility, spectroscopic data revealed subtle vibrations in the comet’s nucleus. Scientists have proposed several hypotheses to explain the phenomenon, including interactions with magnetic fields or interstellar plasma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The 3I/Atlas event challenges our understanding of orbital mechanics and requires us to rethink our models,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object identified in the Solar System. Its unique composition, including a high concentration of carbon dioxide and low water content, suggests it formed in the cold regions of a distant stellar system. Previous observations of interstellar objects have not shown similar behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet resumes its movement, scientists are updating orbital simulation software to incorporate non-gravitational interactions. Further observations of 3I/Atlas will continue, providing insights into rare cosmic phenomena.</p>
