      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Passes 170 Million Miles from Earth as Geminids and Jupiter–Moon Pairing Light Up December Sky</h2>

<p>A rare astronomical event is taking place as NASA tracks the interstellar visitor Comet 3I/ATLAS, which will reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023. The comet is currently about 170 million miles (approximately 273 million kilometers) from Earth, a distance roughly 700 times farther than the Moon. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this event.</p>

<p>This occurrence matters as it marks the closest approach of only the third confirmed interstellar body ever observed. The event coincides with the Geminid meteor shower and a conjunction of Jupiter and the Moon, providing a unique opportunity for skywatchers and scientists alike. NASA continues to monitor the comet's trajectory and its potential impact on astronomical studies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is about 170 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest approach on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is roughly 700 times farther from Earth than the Moon.</li>
    <li>This is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed.</li>
    <li>The Geminid meteor shower is ongoing throughout December.</li>
    <li>A conjunction of Jupiter and the Moon is also occurring this month.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in 2023. NASA has tracked its trajectory as it approaches Earth, with significant attention from both the scientific community and skywatchers.</p>
<p>The comet's closest approach is set for December 19, 2023, coinciding with other celestial events this month.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a remarkable opportunity for both scientists and the public to witness a rare interstellar visitor,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third interstellar object confirmed by astronomers. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, have also garnered significant interest and study.</p>
<p>The ongoing Geminid meteor shower is one of the most prolific meteor showers, occurring annually in December and providing an excellent backdrop for observing celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and gather data from its approach. Skywatchers are encouraged to observe the upcoming celestial events, including the Geminid meteor shower and the Jupiter-Moon conjunction.</p>
