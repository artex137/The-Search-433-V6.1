      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks National Security Concerns</h2>
<p>Scientists have raised alarms over the arrival of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 168 million miles. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the University of Hawai'i's ATLAS station, the comet is moving at a record speed of 130,000 miles per hour.</p>

<p>This situation has prompted discussions among authorities regarding the implications for national security and the potential militarization of space. Experts warn that the object could serve as a pretext for major powers to normalize the deployment of military assets under the guise of 'planetary protection.'</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object designation: C/2025 N1 (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 168 million miles</li>
    <li>Speed: 130,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Expected closest point to Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has since generated significant interest in the scientific community. On December 19, 2025, it made its closest pass to Earth. As it continues its journey, it is expected to approach Jupiter's Hill sphere on March 16, 2026.</p>

<p>During this period, discussions about the implications of the object's trajectory have intensified, particularly concerning military readiness and the potential for space-based defense systems.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is our secret weapon, we will use it only as a last resort,” said Russian President Vladimir Putin, joking about the implications of 3I/ATLAS on December 19, 2025.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Outer Space Treaty prohibits weapons of mass destruction in orbit but does not address kinetic, electronic, or robotic interference systems. This gap has led to concerns about the militarization of space, particularly as countries like the United States, Russia, and China pursue advanced space capabilities.</p>

<p>Reports indicate that Russia has developed satellites equipped with robotic arms, raising concerns about their potential dual-use capabilities. The U.S. Space Force has tracked multiple Chinese satellites engaging in proximity operations, further highlighting the strategic stakes involved with 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, the focus will remain on how nations respond to this unique event. The decisions made in the coming months regarding space policy and military readiness could have long-lasting implications for international security and the future of space exploration.</p>
