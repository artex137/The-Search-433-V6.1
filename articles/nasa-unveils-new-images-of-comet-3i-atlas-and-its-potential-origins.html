      <h2>NASA Unveils New Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS and Its Potential Origins</h2>

<p>NASA has unveiled new images of the interstellar object designated 3I/ATLAS, which scientists have classified as a comet. The comet was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the Atlas survey telescope in Chile. The recent images were captured as 3I/ATLAS approached solar conjunction, positioning it directly on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth on October 21, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the origins of the comet. Research by the Royal Astronomical Society suggests that 3I/ATLAS may have formed from the Milky Way's thin disk layer, which contains primarily younger stars. However, there is a possibility that it originates from the thick disk, a region populated by much older stars. If confirmed, this could mean the comet is over seven billion years old, offering a rare chance to study material predating our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet designated: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First identified: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Images taken: October 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of identification: Chile</li>
    <li>Potential age: Over seven billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA's Atlas survey telescope first identified the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. The comet has since been studied as it neared its solar conjunction on October 21, 2025.</p>

<p>Recent research by the Royal Astronomical Society has shed light on its possible origins, indicating that it may have formed in the Milky Way's thin disk or thick disk.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These findings could deepen our understanding of the formation and evolution of our galaxy,” said a spokesperson for the Royal Astronomical Society.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of comets provides critical insights into the early solar system and the formation of celestial bodies. Previous research has focused on the characteristics of various comets, but 3I/ATLAS may offer a unique perspective due to its potential age and origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to confirm its origins and age, which could enhance our understanding of galactic formation and evolution.</p>
