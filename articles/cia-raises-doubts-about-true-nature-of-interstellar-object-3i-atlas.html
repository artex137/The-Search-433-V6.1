      <h2>CIA raises doubts about true nature of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On January 7, 2026, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has raised concerns about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. While NASA has described 3I/ATLAS as a comet and stated there are no signs of alien life, the CIA's response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request has reignited doubts regarding the object’s true nature.</p>

<p>This issue matters as it highlights ongoing debates within the scientific community about the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, with some experts, including Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb, challenging NASA's conclusions. The CIA's ambiguous response raises further questions about the agency's knowledge of the object and any potential implications for space research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
<li>The CIA responded to a FOIA request in November 2025 regarding the object.</li>
<li>NASA has claimed no signs of alien life on the object.</li>
<li>Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has identified 12 anomalies in the object's behaviour.</li>
<li>3I/ATLAS is expected to exit the solar system by 2030.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 2025, a FOIA request was submitted to the CIA regarding 3I/ATLAS. The CIA's response, stating it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of records related to the request, was released shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth. Following this event, NASA reaffirmed its position that the object was not an alien UFO and showed no signs of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>As of January 7, 2026, Dr. Avi Loeb continues to voice his concerns about the object, emphasizing the anomalies detected in its behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>The CIA can neither confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence of records responsive to your request.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS is part of a larger conversation about unidentified aerial phenomena and their potential implications for space exploration and national security. Previous incidents have prompted increased scrutiny of government agencies' transparency regarding space-related inquiries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter and heads toward the edge of the solar system. Further investigations may be prompted by ongoing debates in the scientific community regarding the object's characteristics.</p>
