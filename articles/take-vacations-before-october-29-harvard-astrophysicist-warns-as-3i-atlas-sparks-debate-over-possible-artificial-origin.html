      <h2>Take vacations before October 29!</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has advised the public to take vacations before October 29 as discussions intensify over the comet 3I/ATLAS, which some speculate may have an artificial origin. The comet, discovered in 2019, is currently approaching the inner solar system.</p>

<p>This warning has sparked a debate among scientists and the public regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring the comet closely as it draws nearer to Earth. The discussion surrounding its potential origins has reignited interest in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2019.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a professor of astrophysics at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA is actively monitoring the comet's trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in December 2019. Since then, astronomers have tracked its path toward the inner solar system. As it approaches the Sun, discussions about its composition and origin have intensified, culminating in recent warnings from experts.</p>

<p>On October 29, 2023, 3I/ATLAS will reach its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun. This event has prompted increased scrutiny from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Take vacations before October 29!” He emphasized the importance of being aware of the comet's approach and the potential implications of its origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet's unusual characteristics have led to speculation about its origins, reminiscent of previous discussions surrounding interstellar objects. The scientific community has been divided on the implications of such findings, with some advocating for further investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Further studies may be conducted to investigate its composition and trajectory after the October 29 perihelion event.</p>
