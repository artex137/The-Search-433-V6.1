      <h2>UFO spotted over Irish skies identified as SpaceX launch</h2>

<p>A bright light that appeared over Irish skies on Wednesday evening at around 6 p.m. has been identified as the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which launched 28 Starlink satellites from California. Reports of the object baffled many across the country, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>The sighting generated numerous theories on social media, prompting a flurry of videos and photos from witnesses. Authorities have confirmed that the object was not an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the traditional sense, as it has been linked to the recent rocket launch.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on October 29, 2025, around 6 p.m.</li>
    <li>Bright light spotted across various locations in Ireland</li>
    <li>SpaceX Falcon 9 launched 28 Starlink satellites from California</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities reported</li>
    <li>Witnesses included pilots and local residents</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, at approximately 6 p.m., a bright light was observed moving across the skies of Ireland, leading to widespread speculation on social media. Witnesses captured videos and photos, reporting the object moving at or below cloud level with no accompanying sound.</p>

<p>Shortly after the sightings, the object was identified as the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which had launched earlier that day from Florida. The rocket's exhaust plume was visible due to clear skies, illuminating the sky as it travelled thousands of kilometres away from Ireland.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That bright moving light over Ireland tonight wasn’t a UFO — it was a SpaceX Falcon 9 launching 28 Starlink satellites from California,” an online source confirmed. “Clear skies made the exhaust plume glow brightly across the sky. No sound — it’s thousands of km away!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a series of recent UFO sightings globally, which have often sparked public interest and speculation. The term “UFO” refers to any unidentified flying object, not necessarily implying extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<p>Prior to this sighting, the Irish public had been engaged in discussions about aerial phenomena, particularly in light of increased rocket launches and satellite deployments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No further investigations are planned regarding this sighting, as the object has been officially identified. Authorities will continue to monitor public interest in aerial phenomena and respond to future reports as necessary.</p>
