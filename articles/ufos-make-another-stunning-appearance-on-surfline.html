      <h2>UFOs Make Another Stunning Appearance On Surfline</h2>

<p>UFOs, or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), have appeared again on Surfline’s Ventura Point camera, with footage recorded on December 6 at 6:10 p.m. by Bash Mendes. The video shows two bright objects hovering over the ocean, sparking interest among viewers and commentators.</p>

<p>This event highlights ongoing public fascination with UFO sightings and the increasing dialogue surrounding them. Surfline, a wave forecasting company, has previously shared similar footage, which has drawn both skepticism and intrigue from the surfing community and beyond.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>UFO sighting recorded on December 6, 2025, at 6:10 p.m.</li>
  <li>Location: Ventura Point, California</li>
  <li>Footage captured by Bash Mendes</li>
  <li>Previous sightings occurred earlier in December</li>
  <li>Surfline is known for wave forecasting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 6, 2025, at approximately 6:10 p.m., Bash Mendes recorded new footage of UFOs above Ventura Point. This sighting follows two previous clips shared by Surfline on their Instagram account, which featured unusual aerial objects over the ocean.</p>

<p>Earlier clips included one at 4:30 a.m. in Ventura, where two objects hovered over the landscape. A second clip from Newport Beach showcased a strange beam of light along the shoreline. These events have contributed to the growing interest and speculation around UFO phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Last night Dec 6 @ 6:10pm Surfline Ventura point cam, check it out. Their mission … To talk to Rob Machado about the new high performance model I’m riding. They said don’t worry we don’t want him back, we just want the boards and @ipdsurf new drop.”</blockquote>
<p>- Bash Mendes</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have gained significant attention in recent years, with various reports and documentaries, including "The Age of Disclosure," prompting discussions about extraterrestrial life. Skeptics argue that anecdotal evidence is insufficient for validation, emphasizing the need for concrete proof.</p>

<p>Michael Shermer, a noted skeptic, has pointed out that eyewitness accounts alone do not constitute reliable evidence. He suggests that without substantial proof, claims of UFO sightings remain speculative.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UFO sightings continues, it remains unclear if any formal investigations will follow. Surfline is likely to monitor user engagement with the footage and may explore further documentation of such phenomena in the future.</p>
