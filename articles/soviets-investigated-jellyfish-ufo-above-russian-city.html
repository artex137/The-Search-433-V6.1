      <h2>Soviets investigated ‘jellyfish’ UFO above Russian city</h2>

<p>On February 12, 2026, a “jellyfish” UFO reportedly hovered over Nalchik, a city in southern Russia, for more than an hour, according to newly released Soviet-era files. No injuries or fatalities have been reported as a result of the sighting.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it highlights how Soviet officials investigated what they termed “Abnormal Atmospheric Phenomena,” despite publicly dismissing such occurrences as Western fantasies. The files, translated and published by journalist George Knapp, reveal the extent to which authorities logged and assessed UFO sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on February 12, 1989</li>
    <li>Location: Nalchik, southern Russia</li>
    <li>Duration: Over one hour</li>
    <li>Witness accounts include luminous streaks and humanoid figures</li>
    <li>Archive consists of approximately 70 pages</li>
    <li>Files were removed from Russia in the early 1990s</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 12, 1989, witnesses in Nalchik reported a large, jellyfish-like object in the sky. The object was visible for more than an hour before disappearing. Other reports included sightings of streaks of light and encounters with humanoid figures. In 1979, a separate incident in Kazakhstan involved campers who claimed to see tall, dark figures near a wooded area.</p>

<p>Investigators recorded these accounts meticulously but did not confirm the nature of what witnesses had seen. The documents reveal a systematic approach to documenting sightings by civilians, soldiers, and technical experts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The archive provides a rare glimpse into how Cold War officials handled mysteries in the sky,” said journalist George Knapp, who translated and published the files.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The newly released documents shed light on how Soviet authorities treated UFO sightings during the Cold War. While the public narrative often dismissed such reports, these files illustrate that investigations were conducted behind closed doors. The lack of physical evidence in many cases, however, left many questions unanswered.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the public gains access to these documents, further investigations into historical UFO sightings may emerge, revealing more about how such phenomena were addressed at the time. No current investigations or charges have been disclosed regarding these sightings.</p>
