      <h2>XRISM telescope records X-ray emission from interstellar object 3I/ATLAS for the first time</h2>

<p>The XRISM space telescope has confirmed the first-ever detection of X-ray emission from comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, during an observation campaign from November 26 to 28, 2025. This historic observation marks a significant milestone in the study of celestial bodies from outside the Solar System.</p>

<p>The detection of X-rays from 3I/ATLAS provides new insights into the chemical composition of interstellar comets. According to the Japanese space agency JAXA and the European Space Agency (ESA), which operate XRISM, this discovery demonstrates that the physical laws governing such interactions are universal across different star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> First detection of X-ray emission from comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Observation dates:</strong> November 26-28, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope:</strong> XRISM</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> JAXA and ESA</li>
    <li><strong>X-ray halo size:</strong> Approximately 400,000 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at about 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Energy range of detection:</strong> 0.3 to 1 kiloelectronvolt (keV)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between November 26 and 28, 2025, the XRISM telescope conducted a 17-hour observation campaign focused on comet 3I/ATLAS. During this period, scientists detected a faint X-ray halo surrounding the comet, confirming its X-ray emissions for the first time.</p>
<p>The detection was achieved as 3I/ATLAS moved angularly away from the Sun, allowing the telescope to safely point at the comet without risking damage to its sensors. Prior to this observation, the comet's proximity to the Sun had made X-ray detection impossible.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The identification of spectral signatures such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen confirms that the X-rays originate from the interaction of solar wind with the comet's material,” said a representative from the XRISM science team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the first extrasolar body to exhibit X-ray emissions, differentiating it from previous interstellar visitors such as 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. While 1I/’Oumuamua showed no cometary activity, 2I/Borisov lacked the necessary observational technology during its passage in 2019 to detect such emissions.</p>
<p>This new finding fills a crucial gap in our understanding of how comets from different star systems interact with solar winds, highlighting the capabilities of modern astronomical technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the Solar System, global astronomical efforts are underway to monitor its activity and composition. Future observations will focus on its evolving tail and gas production as it approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>
