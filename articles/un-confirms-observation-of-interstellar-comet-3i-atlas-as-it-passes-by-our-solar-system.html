      <h2>UN confirms observation of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes by our solar system</h2>

<p>The United Nations has confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is currently traveling through our solar system, providing a unique opportunity for scientific observation. The comet poses no threat to Earth, according to the UN, but has sparked significant interest within the scientific community.</p>

<p>Authorities are emphasizing the importance of this event for planetary defense and scientific research. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) plans to use this opportunity to enhance their capabilities in measuring the positions of comets, which present unique challenges compared to asteroids.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Interstellar comet, only the third ever identified</li>
    <li><strong>Current status:</strong> Active comet with a frozen core and a gas-and-dust envelope (coma)</li>
    <li><strong>Expected collision:</strong> March 2024 with Jupiter</li>
    <li><strong>Observation campaign:</strong> Planned by IAWN since 2024 for Fall 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has captured the attention of the scientific community for several months, with discussions about its classification and nature ongoing. The UN has highlighted its significance for planetary defense and scientific observation.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Jupiter around March 2024, which may provide further insights into its composition and potential extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While it poses no threat, comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and high interest to the scientific community,” the UN stated on its website.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a theoretical physicist, has proposed that 3I/ATLAS could be a “spaceship,” suggesting that “if the rare coincidence between the perijove distance of 3I/ATLAS and the Hill radius will materialize, it might flag a technological signature.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS comes at a time when interest in potential extraterrestrial objects has increased. Scientists have expressed differing opinions on the nature of the comet, with some, like Loeb, advocating for a more controversial view that it may not be a natural celestial body.</p>
<p>The IAWN has been preparing for enhanced observation capabilities, particularly for comets, since 2024, indicating a proactive approach to planetary defense and research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, scientists will closely monitor its trajectory and composition. The planned IAWN observing campaign will likely commence in Fall 2025, with the March 2024 collision with Jupiter serving as a critical moment for potential discoveries.</p>
