      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Reveals Secrets: 7.6 Billion-Year-Old 'Cosmic Fossil' Passes Today</h2>

<p>In the early hours of 19 December 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, passing at a distance of 168 million miles (approximately 1.8 astronomical units). The comet, discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile on 1 July 2025, has sparked interest among astronomers due to its age and unique characteristics.</p>

<p>This event matters because it offers a rare opportunity to study a relic from the early universe. According to Matthew Hopkins, an astronomer at the University of Oxford, the comet could be over 7.6 billion years old, making it the oldest physical object humans have ever detected. Scientists are leveraging various telescopes, including NASA's Psyche mission and the James Webb Space Telescope, to gather data on this ancient traveller.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It approached at a distance of 168 million miles (1.8 astronomical units).</li>
    <li>Its speed was recorded at 42 miles per second (68 km/s).</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be between 0.3 and 5.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>It is believed to contain significant traces of carbon dioxide, methanol, nickel, and cyanide gas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the ATLAS in Chile discovered Comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet has a hyperbolic orbit with an eccentricity of 6.13, the highest ever recorded for a solar system visitor. On 19 December 2025, it made its closest approach to Earth, allowing scientists to conduct observations.</p>

<p>During this time, the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii detected a ghostly green glow from the comet, indicating outgassing as the sun's heat warms its icy nucleus. Data from the James Webb Space Telescope confirmed that the comet is accelerating due to vaporised gases escaping its surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is effectively a time capsule from a different era of galactic history,” said Matthew Hopkins, an astronomer at the University of Oxford.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While 3I/ATLAS comes from another star, it is made of the same fundamental building blocks—ice, rock, and dust—that we find in our own backyard,” added a researcher from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS joins the ranks of other significant interstellar objects, such as 1I/'Oumuamua, which sparked speculation about alien technology in 2017. However, unlike its predecessor, 3I/ATLAS has strong evidence supporting its natural origin, with characteristics typical of comets.</p>

<p>The study of such comets provides insight into the early universe and the formation of our solar system. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to further enhance our understanding of such cosmic events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS exits the solar system, the window for observation is closing. The Virtual Telescope Project in Italy will host a live YouTube webcast at 11 p.m. EST on the night of its closest approach, offering a final glimpse of the comet.</p>
