      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Historic Exit from Solar System with Stunning New Images</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to exit the solar system following its remarkable journey, with its closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2023. The comet, discovered in late June and confirmed as the third known interstellar object in July, has been travelling at speeds of approximately 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</p>

<p>Space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are actively capturing images of the comet as it continues its trajectory. These images showcase the comet's vibrant activity, including jets of gas and dust, and provide important data for scientific analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: Late June 2023</li>
    <li>Confirmed as interstellar object: July 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023, at approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Size: Estimated between 1,400 feet (440 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide</li>
    <li>Latest Hubble image captured: November 30, 2023</li>
    <li>ESA's Juice spacecraft image captured: November 2, 2023</li>
    <li>Full dataset expected: Late February 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in late June 2023 and confirmed in July as the third known interstellar object. In October, it made key close approaches to both Mars and the Sun. On November 2, ESA's Juice spacecraft captured an image of the comet, showing its coma and suggesting two distinct tails. NASA released a new image of 3I/ATLAS taken by the Hubble Space Telescope on November 30, highlighting the comet's nucleus and coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As this enigmatic interstellar visitor approaches Earth, every observation becomes crucial to unraveling its secrets,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of the largest interstellar objects observed to date. Its study contributes to our understanding of celestial bodies from beyond our solar system, and numerous spacecraft, including Mars rovers and solar orbiters, have participated in observing the comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to collect data on 3I/ATLAS, with the full dataset from the Juice spacecraft expected to arrive on Earth by late February 2026. The James Webb Space Telescope and other observatories will also observe the comet in the coming weeks.</p>
