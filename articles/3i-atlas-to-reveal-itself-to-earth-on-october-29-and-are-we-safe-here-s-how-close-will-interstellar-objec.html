      <h2>3I/ATLAS to Reveal Itself to Earth on October 29</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on October 29, 2025, passing at a safe distance of approximately 167 million miles. Authorities have confirmed that the comet poses no threat to the planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it offers scientists a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. Researchers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to learn about its composition, trajectory, and potential implications for understanding other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (167 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Zero - no impact risk</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus Size:</strong> Under 1 km</li>
    <li><strong>Current Brightness:</strong> Between magnitude 12 and 14</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Requirement:</strong> Telescope of at least 8 inches (200mm) aperture</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS first appeared in July 2025. Since its discovery, astronomers have observed its unique characteristics, including a massive jet of gas and dust emitted toward the Sun. The comet is noted for its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is a one-time visitor from another star system.</p>
<p>Images from Spain’s Teide Observatory in August 2025 showed the comet's tail flaring as it approached the Sun, demonstrating typical comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is a mystery interstellar object moving along a hyperbolic path toward the Sun,” said theoretical physicist Michio Kaku.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Its unusual speed and shape continue to puzzle researchers,” stated astrophysicist Miquel Serra-Ricart.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our Solar System, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike regular comets that orbit the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will only pass through once before exiting into deep space.</p>
<p>This brief appearance allows researchers to study comet formation in different regions of the galaxy, providing insights into interstellar chemistry and evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists will continue to observe its behavior and emissions. The comet is expected to reappear in December 2025 for further tracking and study.</p>
