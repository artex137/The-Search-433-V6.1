      <h2>NASA has released new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>NASA unveiled new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on Wednesday, addressing speculation about its origins. First observed in July by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, the comet has sparked interest due to its unusual trajectory through the solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This release matters as it provides clarity on the nature of the comet and dispels rumors regarding its potential as an alien spacecraft. NASA officials have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and have conducted extensive studies using multiple telescopes, including the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2023.</li>
  <li>It is passing through the solar system from an unknown origin.</li>
  <li>NASA used more than a dozen platforms to study the comet.</li>
  <li>The comet reached its closest point to the sun in October 2023.</li>
  <li>It will make its nearest approach to Earth in about a month.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever observed in the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, first observed comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, scientists have tracked the object, using various telescopes to gather data. The comet reached its closest point to the sun in October and is expected to approach Earth within the next month.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Nicola Fox</strong>, NASA's associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, stated, "It's natural to wonder what it is. We love that the world wondered along with us."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Amit Kshatriya</strong>, NASA Associate Administrator, emphasized, "This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet. All evidence points to it being a comet."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Chris Lintott</strong>, University of Oxford astrophysicist, dismissed alien theories: "The idea that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft is simply nonsense. There's nothing about it that suggests such a thing."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object observed in our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its composition, which includes carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, cyanide, and nickel, resembles that of comets found in our solar system, although variations suggest it may have formed in a chemically distinct solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory out of the solar system, scientists will monitor its path and gather further data until its nearest approach to Earth occurs next month.</p>
