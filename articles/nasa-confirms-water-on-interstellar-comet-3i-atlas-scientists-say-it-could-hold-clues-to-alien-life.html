      <h2>NASA Confirms Water on Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory has confirmed traces of water on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, marking a significant discovery in planetary science. The comet, which is currently passing through our Solar System, has shown signs of water activity as detected by the observatory.</p>

<p>This finding is important as it suggests that the ingredients for life may not be unique to our Solar System. Scientists, led by Dr. Zexi Xing from Auburn University, are examining the implications of this discovery on our understanding of cometary behavior and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025 by Hawaii’s ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be around <strong>seven billion years old</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is travelling at over <strong>58 km/s</strong> on a hyperbolic path.</li>
    <li>It is losing approximately <strong>40 kilograms of water per second</strong>.</li>
    <li>This is the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025. NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected traces of water on the comet as it passed through the Solar System. The ultraviolet glow indicating water activity has provided new insights into the comet's chemical composition.</p>

<p>Dr. Zexi Xing and his team have analyzed the data, leading to discussions about the implications of water on the comet for understanding life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Dr. Zexi Xing, lead researcher from Auburn University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This suggests 3I/ATLAS’s icy grains are reacting in ways we’ve never seen before,” said Prof. Dennis Bodewits, co-author of the study. “It’s rewriting what we know about cometary behavior.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When we detect water from an interstellar comet, we’re essentially reading a message from another planetary system,” said Prof. Bodewits.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of two previous interstellar objects: ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. While ‘Oumuamua appeared dry and Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, the discovery of water on 3I/ATLAS indicates a different chemical makeup, suggesting that water-rich comets may be more common across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers expect 3I/ATLAS to become visible again by mid-November 2025. Scientists plan to use advanced instruments and international collaborations to gather more data about the comet and its potential implications for understanding ancient star systems and the origins of life.</p>
