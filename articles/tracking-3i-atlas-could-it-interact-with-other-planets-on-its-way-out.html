      <h2>Tracking 3I/ATLAS: Could it interact with other planets on its way out?</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been moving through our solar system at high speed and will pass safely near Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Its closest approach to Earth will be about 1.8 astronomical units (AU), or roughly 270 million kilometres, which poses no collision risk. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this comet.</p>

<p>This event is significant for scientists as it provides an opportunity to learn about interstellar objects and planetary environments. Authorities, including ESA and NASA, are actively tracking 3I/ATLAS using various spacecraft to analyze its behaviour and interactions with the planets it encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is moving through the solar system at high speed.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is approximately 1.8 AU (270 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>It will pass near Venus (0.65 AU), Mars (0.19 AU), and Jupiter (0.36 AU).</li>
    <li>ESA’s Mars orbiters captured images of 3I/ATLAS in early October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA is using spacecraft data to track and analyze the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been moving through the solar system and will continue its journey past several planets. It is expected to pass relatively close to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, allowing for detailed observations by space probes and telescopes. After these close encounters, the comet will escape the solar system entirely and return to deep space.</p>

<p>Images of the comet were captured by ESA’s Mars Express and Trace Gas Orbiter during its close approach to Mars in early October 2025. NASA is also involved in tracking the comet's behaviour and potential interactions with planetary environments.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Tracking 3I/ATLAS not only keeps Earth safe but also improves our knowledge of comet behaviours and the dynamics of solar system bodies,” said a spokesperson from ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is considered a unique interstellar traveller, providing scientists with insights into the characteristics of comets from outside our solar system. Understanding its path can help researchers prepare for future interstellar objects and protect space assets from potential threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and will analyze the data collected from its interactions with these planets. No further actions are required, as no impact is expected.</p>
