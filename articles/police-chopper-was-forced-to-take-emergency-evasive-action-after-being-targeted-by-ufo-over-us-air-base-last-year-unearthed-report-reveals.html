      <h2>Police chopper encounters unidentified flying objects over US air base</h2>

<p>A police helicopter has had a close encounter with unidentified flying objects over RAF Lakenheath, a US military base in England, on November 22, 2024. The helicopter crew reportedly took emergency evasive action to avoid a potential mid-air collision with high-speed drones.</p>

<p>This incident highlights ongoing concerns about airspace security around military installations. Authorities have launched investigations into the reports, which include multiple sightings of drones and unidentified objects over several US air bases in the region.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: November 22, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, England</li>
    <li>Involved agency: National Police Air Service (NPAS)</li>
    <li>Reported speed of drones: approximately 140 knots (161 km/h)</li>
    <li>Reported number of drone sightings: 10-15 at each base over several nights</li>
    <li>Reported distance between aircraft: 1,700 ft</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 20, 2024, Suffolk Police logs document multiple drone sightings over RAF Feltwell, RAF Lakenheath, and RAF Mildenhall. Reports indicate that approximately 20 drones were observed flying between 18:00 and 00:00 hours.</p>

<p>On November 21, 2024, police logs noted that the drones appeared to be larger than typical hobby drones, and witnesses described them as well-lit and flying low.</p>

<p>On November 22, 2024, the NPAS helicopter encountered the unidentified objects while flying over RAF Lakenheath. The crew reported performing an emergency dive to evade the drones, which they believed were pursuing them.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They were forced to take emergency evasive action in relation to a drone which came within a dangerously close proximity to them,” said an incident log from Suffolk Police.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the 30-minute video with pilot audio, nobody mentions F-15s. They only talk about the drones. How they're basically mirroring the helicopter's movements,” a UK military source said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader trend involving multiple reports of unidentified objects breaching airspace over US military bases. The UK Airprox Board, which investigates mid-air near misses, attributed the NPAS encounter to a misidentification of an American F-15 fighter jet, despite the pilots’ insistence on the presence of drones.</p>

<p>The investigation has raised questions about airspace security and the effectiveness of current monitoring practices around military installations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The investigation into the incident has been handed over to the UK Ministry of Defence Police, which has not yet published its findings. The lack of transparency has prompted calls for more detailed reporting from authorities regarding the incidents.</p>
