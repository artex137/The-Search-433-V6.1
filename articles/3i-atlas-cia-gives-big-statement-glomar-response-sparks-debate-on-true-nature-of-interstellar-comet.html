      <h2>3I/ATLAS: CIA Gives Big Statement, Glomar Response Sparks Debate On True Nature Of Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has issued a statement regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, stating it could “neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records” related to the comet. This response has reignited discussions about whether 3I/ATLAS, discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in July 2025, is merely a comet or something more enigmatic.</p>

<p>This statement is significant as it comes in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by researcher John Greenewald Jr., who expected a straightforward confirmation or denial regarding CIA files on the object. The CIA's evasive answer suggests the potential existence of sensitive information, raising questions among critics about the classification of data that NASA has officially deemed a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Agency Involved:</strong> U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</li>
    <li><strong>FOIA Requestor:</strong> John Greenewald Jr.</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's Statement Date:</strong> November 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Scientific Consensus:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope. On November 19, 2025, NASA confirmed that the object is a comet of natural origin. Following this, John Greenewald Jr. filed a FOIA request to the CIA for information regarding the object. The CIA responded with a statement indicating that it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of relevant records, suggesting potential classified information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself currently and properly classified and is intelligence sources and methods information protected from disclosure.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “If this information is treated as sensitive enough to be classified by the CIA, it is surprising, given that NASA officials stated decisively that 3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Critics of the CIA's response, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have raised concerns about the classification of information regarding 3I/ATLAS. Loeb has suggested that the CIA's classification could be an attempt to prevent public panic over the object, which some speculate may have characteristics beyond those of a typical comet. However, mainstream scientists maintain that the available data aligns with cometary physics, and no confirmed technosignatures have been observed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS continues, with scientists and researchers calling for transparency regarding the CIA's information. Further investigations into the object’s characteristics and continued analysis by independent astronomers are expected.</p>
