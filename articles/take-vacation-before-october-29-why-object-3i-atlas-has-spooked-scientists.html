      <h2>'Take vacation before October-29': Why object 3I/ATLAS has spooked scientists</h2>

<p>A warning from a Harvard astrophysicist to take vacations before October 29 has led to speculation about the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS passing through our solar system. The object, detected in July, has garnered attention due to its massive size, unusual chemical composition, and unexpected movement.</p>

<p>This matter has raised concerns within the scientific community, prompting NASA to assure the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The object’s unique characteristics, however, have led to divided opinions among scientists regarding its origin and nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> 5.6 km wide</li>
    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Nearly twice as fast as Oumuamua and Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Emission:</strong> 4g of nickel per second</li>
    <li><strong>Detection:</strong> First detected in July</li>
    <li><strong>Observation site:</strong> Keck II telescope in Hawaii</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023. Since then, its unusual characteristics have drawn significant attention from both the scientific community and the public. Dr. Avi Loeb, the astrophysicist who issued the warning, has pointed out the object's strange chemical composition and behavior, suggesting it may not be a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>In response to the growing speculation, NASA has publicly stated that 3I/ATLAS will safely pass through the inner solar system, reaffirming that there is no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA has assured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth,” the agency stated in a recent announcement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Avi Loeb expressed skepticism about NASA's transparency, claiming that the agency is withholding certain data and images of the object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community remains divided over the origin of 3I/ATLAS. While some scientists consider it a potential sign of intelligent design due to its unique characteristics, others maintain it is a natural celestial object. The debate reflects broader discussions about the nature of interstellar objects and their implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into 3I/ATLAS will continue as scientists analyze its trajectory and chemical makeup. The public will be kept informed about any new findings regarding the object as it approaches the inner solar system.</p>
