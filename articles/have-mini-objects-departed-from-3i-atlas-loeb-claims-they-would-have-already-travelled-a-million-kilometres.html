      <h2>Have mini-objects departed from 3I/ATLAS? Loeb claims they would have already travelled a million kilometres</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has claimed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may have released small probes, citing new images taken on November 20. Loeb suggests that these probes could have already travelled a distance of approximately one million kilometres from the comet.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as scientists seek to understand the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential for hosting technological objects. Loeb's assertions raise questions about the origins of these objects, and he has called for further observations as the comet approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Observed moving at a speed of 60 km/second.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is projected for December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 29-30, 2023.</li>
    <li>New images taken by M. Jäger, G. Rhemann, and E. Prosperi on November 20, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. It was observed moving at a speed of 60 km/second and exhibited a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originated outside the solar system. The comet reached perihelion on October 29-30, 2023, after which it developed a visible tail and changed colour. On November 20, new images were captured, leading to Loeb's latest claims regarding the potential release of probes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fundamental question to address in the coming weeks is whether these smaller objects are real and not an artefact of a satellite streak, and if real, are they natural or technological in origin?” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has previously suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be an "alien mothership" capable of ejecting probes to study celestial bodies. His claims have sparked discussions about the potential for technological objects in interstellar space and the implications for our understanding of the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are anticipated as it approaches Earth, which may provide clarity on the nature of the objects Loeb has described. Scientists will continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and behaviour in the coming weeks.</p>
