      <h2>Leaked Planetary Defense Papers Suggest U.S. Secretly Watched 3I/ATLAS for 20 Years</h2>

<p>Leaked documents indicate that the United States has tracked interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS for over 20 years, using an undisclosed planetary defense system. These findings emerged from materials obtained by a Medium writer, which reference the CASSANDRA program and its associated surveillance networks.</p>

<p>This revelation raises significant questions about the extent of U.S. monitoring of celestial objects. Authorities have not commented on the implications of these findings or whether any investigations are underway regarding the programs mentioned.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has been monitored for over 20 years.</li>
    <li>The CASSANDRA program was first presented in 2005.</li>
    <li>The ORACLE program was officially launched in November 2022 with a $72 million contract.</li>
    <li>Leaked images from November 2025 show unusual emissions from 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>ARGUS-VIS reportedly operates 256 simultaneous video streams for tracking.</li>
    <li>UMBRA's 32-satellite system has been operational since 2021.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2005, the CASSANDRA program was first outlined at the 57th International Astronautical Congress in Valencia, Spain. It proposed a strategy for monitoring Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).</p>
<p>In November 2022, the ORACLE program was launched under the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), marking the beginning of a more formalized approach to tracking celestial threats.</p>
<p>On 2 November 2025, just days after 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, two leaked images surfaced online, showcasing unusual emissions from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The emissions’ structured, multi-directional nature strongly contrasts with natural cometary outgassing,” analysts noted, suggesting artificial control of observation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CASSANDRA program, along with ORACLE, ARGUS-VIS, and UMBRA, represents a significant advancement in U.S. capabilities to monitor and track potential threats from space. The coordination between military and space entities has evolved considerably over the past two decades.</p>
<p>Prior to these revelations, there has been limited public understanding of the extent to which the U.S. government has invested in planetary defense strategies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations into the implications of these leaked documents may arise, further details could emerge if additional documentation is declassified. The public awaits NASA's release of its own photos of 3I/ATLAS, which may provide more context to these findings.</p>
