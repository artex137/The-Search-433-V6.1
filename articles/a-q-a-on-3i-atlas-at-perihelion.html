      <h2>A Q & A on 3I/ATLAS at Perihelion</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun today, October 29, 2025, at 7:47 AM Eastern Time, according to the JPL Horizons trajectory data. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the event.</p>

<p>This perihelion is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, including whether it is a natural comet or something else entirely. Authorities are currently monitoring the comet for any unusual activity, as its unique characteristics have sparked interest in potential technological origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion time: October 29, 2025, at 7:47 AM Eastern Time</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 269 million kilometers on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Diameter: Minimum of 5 kilometers</li>
    <li>Unique characteristics: 8 anomalies ranked 4 on the Loeb scale</li>
    <li>Monitoring by radio observers has been initiated</li>
    <li>Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna is facilitating the release of HiRISE images</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed since its discovery, with significant observations occurring in July and August 2025, when it displayed a sunward jet. The perihelion event today marked the closest approach to the Sun, while further observations are planned as it continues its trajectory through the Solar System.</p>

<p>As of yesterday, radio observers have been asked to monitor 3I/ATLAS for any signs of technological activity. This follows the discovery of its unique properties that warrant further investigation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS maneuvers, releases mini-probes, or transmits radio signals, then we will know that it is technological in origin,” said Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The implication of alien technology would be huge and therefore we must take this possibility seriously,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have prompted discussions about the nature of such visitors. 3I/ATLAS's anomalies place it in a unique category, raising the possibility of an artificial origin.</p>

<p>The ongoing analysis of these anomalies is crucial, as they could provide insights into the origins of interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for any signs of activity. Future observations may reveal more about its characteristics and origins, and the release of HiRISE images is expected to assist in this analysis.</p>
