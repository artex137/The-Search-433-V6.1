      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 18, 2023, at a distance of 167 million miles. This comet, traveling at an unprecedented speed of 137,000 miles per hour, poses no threat of collision, but its unique characteristics have raised concerns among experts about planetary defense systems.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS offers a rare opportunity for astronomers to study an interstellar object. The United Nations' International Asteroid Warning Network is closely monitoring the comet's trajectory. This exercise aims to refine global planetary defense capabilities, as the comet’s speed highlights potential vulnerabilities in current tracking systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass within 167 million miles of Earth.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>The closest approach occurs on December 18, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA has detected substantial quantities of hydrogen cyanide and carbon dioxide from the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third identified interstellar object to enter our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet was first discovered in July 2022.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2022, prompting interest from the scientific community. Since then, astronomers have been studying the comet's trajectory and composition. On December 18, 2023, the comet will make its closest approach to Earth, providing a unique opportunity for observation.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches, the Virtual Telescope Project will host a live stream for viewers unable to see it due to weather conditions. This event marks a significant moment in astronomical observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It's like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second,” said astronomer David Jewitt, referring to the comet's extreme speed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While the comet poses no threat to Earth, monitoring its trajectory helps refine our planetary defense systems,” said a representative from the United Nations' International Asteroid Warning Network.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike typical comets, which follow elliptical orbits, 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic path, indicating it will not return. Its speed raises concerns about the effectiveness of current tracking systems for fast-moving objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, astronomers will analyze data gathered during its flyby. This will contribute to ongoing efforts to enhance planetary defense strategies against potential future threats from space.</p>
