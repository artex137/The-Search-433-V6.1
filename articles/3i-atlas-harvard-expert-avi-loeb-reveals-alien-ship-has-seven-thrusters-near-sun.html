      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Expert Avi Loeb Reveals 'Alien Ship' Has Seven Thrusters Near Sun</h2>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has claimed that the interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS may be an 'alien ship' equipped with seven visible thrusters as it approaches the Sun. This assertion was made in a report published by the Daily Star, detailing the object's unusual features.</p>

<p>Loeb's hypothesis raises significant questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its implications for humanity. As the object nears perihelion, researchers from NASA and other observatories are closely monitoring its trajectory and characteristics to gather more data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object approaching the Sun.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has identified seven visible jets associated with the object.</li>
    <li>The object features a large glowing halo extending up to 500,000 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Loeb describes the object as a 'gift from interstellar space.'</li>
    <li>Mainstream astronomers have expressed skepticism about Loeb's claims.</li>
    <li>NASA and other observatories are monitoring the object's trajectory and composition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has published several analyses discussing the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. He has identified ten anomalies that set it apart from typical comets. Key among these is its trajectory, which aligns closely with the ecliptic plane, and significant non-gravitational acceleration that has been observed. These observations led Loeb to propose the possibility that 3I/ATLAS is an extraterrestrial technological product.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion, scientists continue to gather data to determine its nature. The object's trajectory and the visible features have sparked debate within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The 10 anomalies motivated me to propose the possibility that 3I/ATLAS is an extraterrestrial technological product of another civilisation in the Milky Way galaxy."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr Samantha Lawler commented, "All evidence points to this being an ordinary comet that was ejected from another solar system."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader debate in the scientific community about the existence of extraterrestrial life and technology. While some researchers, like Loeb, advocate for the exploration of unconventional hypotheses, others emphasize the need for rigorous scientific validation.</p>

<p>Loeb's claims have been met with skepticism from mainstream astronomers, who argue that the features observed could be explained by natural phenomena typical of comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the inner Solar System, NASA and other observatories will gather more data to clarify its nature. The scientific community remains focused on observation and analysis to determine whether the object is a natural interstellar body or something more extraordinary.</p>
