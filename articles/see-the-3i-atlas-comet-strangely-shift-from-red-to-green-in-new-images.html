      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Shifts from Red to Green as Scientists Observe Changes</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has changed color from red to a faint green glow as it moves away from the sun, according to observations made by astronomers using the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii on November 26. This shift indicates that the comet is reacting to solar heat and releasing new gases, providing scientists with important information about its composition and behavior.</p>

<p>This color change matters because it allows researchers to study the comet's material while it is still relatively close to Earth. The European Space Agency's XMM-Newton spacecraft also observed 3I/ATLAS in X-rays on December 3, enhancing the understanding of the comet's characteristics. These observations help scientists learn about how interstellar objects form and behave as they interact with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed changing color on November 26, 2023.</li>
  <li>Previous images from Gemini South in Chile showed a red hue.</li>
  <li>Color change linked to solar heat and gas release.</li>
  <li>XMM-Newton spacecraft studied the comet in X-rays for nearly 20 hours on December 3, 2023.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS entered the solar system traveling at approximately 137,000 mph.</li>
  <li>Only two other confirmed interstellar visitors have been sighted: 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 26, 2023, astronomers captured new color images of 3I/ATLAS using the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. These images revealed a shift in the comet's color from red to green.</p>
<p>On December 3, 2023, the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton spacecraft observed the comet in X-rays for nearly 20 hours, providing additional data on its composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  "Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a post-perihelion greenish glow in time for the holidays," said Bryce Bolin, a research scientist from Eureka Scientific who led the observations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  "Sharing an observing experience in some of the best conditions available gives the public a truly front-row view of our interstellar visitor," Bolin added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  "It's different, and yet it's still coffee," said Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for solar system small bodies, comparing the comet's characteristics to various regional coffees to illustrate its unique properties.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable because it is an interstellar comet, having come from another part of the galaxy. It was likely ejected from its original location due to a gravitational jolt from a planet or passing star. The comet's carbon dioxide-to-water ratio and the presence of unusual metals and dust features distinguish it from typical solar system comets.</p>
<p>Comets are generally icy bodies that release gas and dust as they approach the sun. Most known comets are remnants from the solar system's formation 4.6 billion years ago, but many more likely exist in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor the changes in 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. They are particularly interested in how the comet will respond to solar heat over time, which may lead to further observations and insights into its composition.</p>
