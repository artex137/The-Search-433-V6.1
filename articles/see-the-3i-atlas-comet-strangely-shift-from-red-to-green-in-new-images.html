      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Changes Colour as It Moves Away from the Sun</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shifted from a reddish tint to a faint green glow as it moves away from the sun, according to observations from the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. This change was noted on November 26, 2023, after the comet emerged from the other side of the sun.</p>

<p>This colour change indicates that the comet is reacting to solar heat and releasing new gases into space. Astronomers are using the new data to gain insights into the comet's composition and behaviour. The European Space Agency's XMM-Newton spacecraft observed 3I/ATLAS in X-rays for nearly 20 hours on December 3, 2023, further contributing to the study of this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently emitting a green glow.</li>
    <li>Observations from Gemini North in Hawaii took place on November 26, 2023.</li>
    <li>XMM-Newton spacecraft observed the comet for nearly 20 hours on December 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at roughly 137,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is not expected to return to the solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are using multiple spacecraft to monitor the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 26, 2023, astronomers captured images of 3I/ATLAS using the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. The comet displayed a reddish hue prior to this date, attributed to gases in its coma. As it moved away from the sun, the comet's colour changed to a greenish glow.</p>
<p>On December 3, 2023, the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton spacecraft conducted a 20-hour observation of the comet in X-rays, revealing further details about its composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a post-perihelion greenish glow in time for the holidays,” said Bryce Bolin, a research scientist from Eureka Scientific.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Sharing an observing experience in some of the best conditions available gives the public a truly front-row view of our interstellar visitor,” Bolin added. “Allowing the public to see what we do as astronomers and how we do it also helps demystify the scientific and data collection process.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for solar system small bodies, compared the comet's characteristics to different types of coffee, stating, “It's different, and yet it's still coffee.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three confirmed interstellar visitors, with previous sightings including 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike typical comets from the solar system, 3I/ATLAS has shown unique characteristics, including an unusual carbon dioxide-to-water ratio.</p>
<p>Astronomers expect that studying 3I/ATLAS will provide valuable insights into the formation of interstellar objects. The comet's X-ray emissions, which result from gas interactions with the solar wind, offer a glimpse into its composition that is difficult to obtain through other means.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will monitor its behaviour and changes in composition. The ongoing observations from various space telescopes will help deepen understanding of this unique interstellar object.</p>
