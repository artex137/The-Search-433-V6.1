      <h2>Pentagon secretly planted Area 51 UFO conspiracy theory to hide classified weapons program: bombshell report</h2>

<p>The Pentagon has reportedly fueled UFO conspiracy theories, including claims of aliens at Area 51 in Nevada, to obscure secret weapons programs, according to a review by the Department of Defense. The findings, detailed in a report by the Wall Street Journal, reveal that an Air Force colonel provided fabricated photos of flying saucers to a bar owner near Area 51 in the 1980s as part of a disinformation campaign.</p>

<p>This revelation highlights the lengths to which military officials have gone to protect classified projects, including the testing of the F-117 Nighthawk stealth warplane during the Cold War. The report indicates that the Pentagon has used UFO mythology to divert attention from its military assets, raising questions about transparency in government operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Air Force colonel's disinformation campaign took place in the 1980s.</li>
    <li>The F-117 Nighthawk was the first stealth warplane tested at Area 51.</li>
    <li>Sean Kirkpatrick is the director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).</li>
    <li>The Pentagon issued an order in 2023 to end the practice of fake UFO briefings.</li>
    <li>Robert Salas, a former Air Force captain, witnessed a UFO incident in 1967.</li>
    <li>The DOD plans to release a follow-up report later this year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the 1980s, an Air Force colonel visited a bar near Area 51, where he distributed fake UFO photographs to the owner, according to the Department of Defense review. This incident aimed to create a smokescreen for the testing of the F-117 Nighthawk stealth aircraft.</p>

<p>In 2022, Sean Kirkpatrick began investigating various UFO theories as the first director of the AARO. His office discovered multiple instances where conspiracy theories were linked back to Pentagon activities.</p>

<p>In 2023, the Pentagon issued an order to cease the practice of misleading briefings about a fictitious “Yankee Blue” unit that supposedly investigated alien aircraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>The department is committed to releasing a second volume of its Historical Record Report, to include AARO’s findings on reports of potential pranks and inauthentic materials.</blockquote>

<p>— Department of Defense</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon's use of UFO-related disinformation is part of a broader pattern of government agencies obscuring military projects through conspiracy theories. This strategy was believed to be particularly important during the Cold War to protect sensitive technologies from adversaries.</p>

<p>Prior incidents, such as Robert Salas's claims of witnessing a UFO during a nuclear missile test in 1967, exemplify how military personnel have been left uninformed about the true nature of their experiences, often leading to the public's belief in extraterrestrial involvement.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Department of Defense plans to enhance transparency and provide further details in a follow-up report scheduled for release later this year. Investigations into past practices and the implications of these findings are ongoing.</p>
