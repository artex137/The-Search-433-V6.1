      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS continues to display a Sun-facing anti-tail</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is currently exhibiting a Sun-facing anti-tail as it travels through the inner Solar System. Observations have confirmed this feature is physical, not a temporary perspective effect. The latest images were captured by Teerasak Thaluang on December 13, 2025, using a 0.26-meter telescope in Rayong, Thailand.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant for astronomers studying the characteristics of interstellar objects. Both Earth-based and space-based instruments are actively monitoring 3I/ATLAS to track any changes in its position, brightness, or tail pattern as it approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 270.5 million kilometers from Earth as of December 14, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest distance, or perigee, on December 19, 2025, at 269.9097 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21 and November 30, 2025, confirmed the anti-tail at different distances of 2.98 and 1.91 astronomical units, respectively.</li>
    <li>Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph imaged 3I/ATLAS on November 26, 2025, revealing a glowing halo likely caused by diatomic carbon molecules.</li>
    <li>ESA’s X-ray space observatory XMM-Newton observed the object for 20 hours on December 3, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS was first identified in Hubble Space Telescope images taken when the object was 2.98 astronomical units from Earth.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2025, Hubble captured further images of the anti-tail at a distance of 1.91 astronomical units.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2025, images from the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph revealed the anti-tail and a glowing halo around the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anti-tail is a consistent feature of 3I/ATLAS, confirmed across multiple observation platforms,” said Harvard Professor Avi Loeb, who has studied the object.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These observations are significant for understanding the behavior of interstellar objects as they interact with solar radiation,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The anti-tail phenomenon has been studied in the context of sunlight scattering by ice fragments shed from 3I/ATLAS. Previous studies have proposed that these particles evaporate before being pushed away by solar radiation, preventing a conventional cometary tail.</p>
<p>This is the first confirmed occurrence of an anti-tail observed in an interstellar object, marking a significant finding for astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Continuous monitoring of 3I/ATLAS is ongoing to gather more data about its structure, trajectory, and material composition. Updates will be provided as new information becomes available.</p>
