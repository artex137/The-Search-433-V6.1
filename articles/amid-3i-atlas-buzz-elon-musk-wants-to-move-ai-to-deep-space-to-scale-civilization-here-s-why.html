      <h2>Elon Musk Proposes Moving AI to Deep Space Amid Interest in Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Elon Musk has proposed relocating artificial intelligence (AI) to deep space to enhance civilization's energy capabilities, coinciding with increased public interest in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. During a recent meeting with Tesla shareholders, Musk highlighted the potential for solar-powered AI satellites in low Earth orbit and beyond.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it aligns with Musk's vision of advancing civilization on the Kardashev Scale, which measures a civilization's energy consumption. Musk stated that accessing solar power in deep space could provide a vast energy supply, far exceeding what is available on Earth. Major tech companies, including Google and Amazon, are also exploring similar projects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet 3I/ATLAS:</strong> Currently generating buzz on social media as a possible alien probe.</li>
    <li><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and X/Twitter, has proposed moving AI to deep space.</li>
    <li><strong>Kardashev Scale:</strong> Musk aims to reach Kardashev 2 by utilizing solar energy from space.</li>
    <li><strong>Google:</strong> Plans to launch two satellites to establish an AI data center in space.</li>
    <li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> Will scale up Starlink satellites to facilitate the project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, interest in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has surged, prompting discussions about extraterrestrial life and advanced technologies. During a meeting with Tesla shareholders, held on November 12, 2025, Musk outlined his vision for a solar-powered AI satellite constellation. He emphasized that moving AI to deep space is crucial for accessing more energy than Earth can provide.</p>

<p>In a series of tweets between November 1 and November 12, Musk reiterated the potential of Starlink satellites to support this initiative. He highlighted that even minor adjustments in solar energy reaching Earth could mitigate climate change.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To make any progress on a Kardashev 2 scale, you kind of have to do space solar power.” — Elon Musk</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A large solar-powered AI satellite constellation would be able to prevent global warming by making tiny adjustments in how much solar energy reached Earth.” — Elon Musk</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Kardashev Scale is a method of measuring a civilization's technological advancement based on its energy consumption. Musk's push for solar energy in deep space reflects a broader trend among tech leaders to explore sustainable energy solutions. Previous initiatives have included satellite-based internet and renewable energy projects aimed at reducing humanity's carbon footprint.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Musk and other tech leaders pursue their ambitious plans, the next steps include developing the necessary satellite technology and launching missions to establish AI data centers in space. Further discussions and collaborations among tech companies are expected as they explore the potential of space-based solar power.</p>
