      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals dust and tail anomalies that defy scientific explanations</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system, has exhibited unusual characteristics during its passage through the Solar System, generating debate among international astronomers. The comet has shown an absence of a typical tail and a distinctive dust composition, which has prompted increased scientific interest as it moves away from the Sun.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it represents the third confirmed interstellar object in the Solar System, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. NASA and ESA have mobilized telescopes to monitor 3I/ATLAS, collecting data that could provide insights into distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025 by the ATLAS system</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): October 2025, approximately 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun</li>
    <li>Minimum distance to Earth: December 2025, approximately 1.8 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Estimated size: core of a few kilometers</li>
    <li>Current distance from Earth: greater than 300 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Current period of rotation: approximately 7.1 hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, initially designated as A11pl3Z. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its interstellar origin shortly thereafter. The object passed perihelion in October 2025, without posing any risk to Earth. In December 2025, it reached its minimum distance from Earth, eliminating any possibility of collision. Observations have shown that as the comet moves away from the Sun, it does not develop a visible fine dust tail, which is typical for many comets.</p>

<p>Recent observations indicate a change in the comet's course after perihelion, possibly due to significant mass loss, a common occurrence in active comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The phenomenon represents normal behavior in the withdrawal phase,” said astronomer Sergei Yazev, explaining that reduced solar heat decreases the sublimation of ice, resulting in less cometary tail formation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third recorded interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua, which exhibited no cometary activity, and Borisov, which had a more pronounced tail. Its combination of traits offers a unique opportunity to study body formation in other systems and contributes to understanding the distribution of matter in interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research on 3I/ATLAS will continue while the comet remains visible through professional telescopes. Accumulated data will assist in developing models for future interstellar visitors and may lead to missions that include interception of similar objects with dedicated probes.</p>
