      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is now turning emerald green hue</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown a bright emerald green color as it nears the halfway point of its journey through the solar system, according to recent images captured during the “blood moon” lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025, over Namibia.</p>

<p>This unexpected color change has intrigued astronomers and provides insight into the behavior of interstellar comets. Authorities, including NASA and various astronomers, are studying the phenomenon to understand the factors contributing to the comet's vibrant hue as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was photographed on September 7, 2025, during a lunar eclipse.</li>
    <li>The images were taken by astrophotographers Michael Jäger and Gerald Rhemann in Namibia.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma measures 2.5 arcminutes across, with a short tail visible as of September 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet, classified due to its hyperbolic orbit.</li>
    <li>The comet is not considered a threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is expected in December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 7, 2025, astrophotographers Michael Jäger and Gerald Rhemann captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS during the “blood moon” lunar eclipse in Namibia. The darkened sky allowed for clear visibility of the comet's new emerald green color.</p>

<p>On September 9, 2025, a short tail of the comet was observed using a 12"/f-3.6 astrograph in Namibia.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb, an astronomer at Harvard University, has noted potential chemical influences on the color change, including the presence of cyanide detected by the Very Large Telescope in the Atacama Desert.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sudden change in color provides a rare insight into the behavior of interstellar visitors,” according to a report by Live Science.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While no analysis has directly found dicarbon in the comet’s coma, it might be located in the deeper layers of the comet,” said astronomers studying the phenomenon.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is not the first to display a green hue. In early 2023, comet C/2022 E3, also known as the “green comet,” was observed passing Earth. Other comets, including SWAN25F and 12P/Pons, exhibited similar color changes as they approached the Sun in late 2024.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of comets changing color has been linked to the release of rare chemicals as they near the Sun. Researchers have studied the involvement of diatomic carbon, known to contribute to the green color of comets since the 1930s.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further studies are expected to confirm the reasons behind the unusual color change of comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet is anticipated to reappear in a few months as it moves behind the Sun and will reach its closest point to Earth in December 2025.</p>
