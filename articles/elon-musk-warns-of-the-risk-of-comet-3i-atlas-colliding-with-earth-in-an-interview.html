      <h2>Elon Musk warns of the risk of comet 3I/ATLAS colliding with Earth in an interview</h2>

<p>In a recent interview on the podcast "Joe," Elon Musk discussed the potential risks associated with comet 3I/ATLAS, detected in July by the ATLAS system in Chile. Musk highlighted the comet's destructive potential, although no confirmed impact route has been established. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this comet.</p>

<p>The discussion surrounding comet 3I/ATLAS has gained traction online following its perihelion on October 30, when it passed 210 million kilometers from the Sun. Authorities, including NASA and SETI scientists, have been monitoring the comet closely to assess any possible threats. Musk classified the comet as a natural object, dismissing speculation about its artificial origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached on October 30, 2023, at a distance of 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2023, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet consists of cyanide, nickel, and other volatile substances.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESO confirmed the presence of streaks on the comet as early as July 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>Post-perihelion observations on November 5 indicated a compact source with a 13% mass loss.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS system in Chile. Initial observations by the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21 revealed its distinctive features. NASA and ESO confirmed the comet's characteristics shortly after its discovery. The object reached its perihelion on October 30, 2023, and is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<p>On November 5, post-perihelion observations indicated a compact source without a prominent tail, consistent with a noted mass loss. Ongoing monitoring by global telescopes aims to capture high-resolution images of the comet during its December approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“In the event of a collision, an object the size and speed of 3I/ATLAS could be capable of obliterating entire continents,” Musk said. “Fortunately, this scenario is ruled out by the comet’s current orbit.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to pass through our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua’ and ‘Borisov’. Its detection has prompted increased scrutiny from the scientific community, including SETI and NASA, which have found no evidence supporting claims of an artificial origin. Comparisons with other interstellar objects, such as 2I/Borisov, reinforce the natural classification of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Global telescopes are preparing to track comet 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach in December. This observation will provide crucial data for refining models of interstellar objects and improving surveillance against space threats.</p>
