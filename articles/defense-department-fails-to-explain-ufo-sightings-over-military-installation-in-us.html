      <h2>Defense Department fails to explain UFO sightings over military installation in US</h2>

<p>The United States Department of Defense has reported over 8,000 unidentified flying objects (UFO) sightings across the U.S. from December 2022 to June 2025, according to a report by Enigma. The majority of these sightings have occurred during nighttime hours, specifically between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m., with many reported near military installations in New York, California, and Arizona. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to these sightings.</p>

<p>This matter has raised significant concerns among authorities and the public regarding national security and the nature of these unidentified objects. The Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has attributed many sightings to natural phenomena but has acknowledged unresolved cases that continue to perplex officials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>More than 8,000 UFO sightings reported from December 2022 to June 2025.</li>
    <li>Majority of sightings occurred between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m.</li>
    <li>422 reports specifically mentioned metallic orbs.</li>
    <li>Most sightings occurred over military installations in New York, California, and Arizona.</li>
    <li>21 out of 757 UFO sightings from May 2023 to June 2024 were classified as unresolved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between December 2022 and June 2025, Enigma has documented a surge in UFO sightings across the U.S., with a notable concentration during the late-night hours. The AARO has conducted reviews of these reports, noting that many have been attributed to natural phenomena, while others remain unexplained.</p>

<p>In its annual report, the AARO highlighted that out of 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024, 21 cases were unresolved, indicating an ongoing investigation into these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The majority of sightings have been explained as natural phenomena such as flocks of birds, drones, aircraft, or balloons,” said a spokesperson for the Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent surge in UFO sightings follows decades of interest and speculation regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. The government's response has evolved, with a focus on transparency and public reporting through platforms like Enigma. Despite this, many sightings remain unexplained, leading to continued calls for further investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO is expected to continue its investigations into the unresolved sightings, with further reports anticipated in the coming months. The focus will remain on understanding the nature of these unidentified objects and their implications for national security.</p>
