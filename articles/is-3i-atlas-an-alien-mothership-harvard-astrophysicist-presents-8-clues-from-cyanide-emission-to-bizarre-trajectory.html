      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS An Alien Mothership? Harvard Astrophysicist Presents 8 Clues</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Prof. Avi Loeb has presented a series of eight anomalies regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently travelling through our solar system at a speed of 60 km/sec. The comet was first observed on October 23, 2025, and its trajectory has raised questions about its nature.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it may suggest the comet is not merely a natural phenomenon. Loeb emphasizes the need to explore the implications of these anomalies, which could indicate advanced technology. He has outlined these clues in a recent blog post.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 5 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>It is moving at a speed of 60 km/sec.</li>
    <li>The comet's mass is about a million times greater than the first known interstellar object, 1I/'Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass within tens of millions of kilometers from Mars, Venus, and Jupiter.</li>
    <li>The gas plume around the comet contains only 4% water by mass.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS shows a nickel-to-cyanide ratio significantly larger than that of known comets.</li>
    <li>It has demonstrated extreme negative polarization, unprecedented in comet observations.</li>
    <li>The comet's arrival direction coincides with the radio "Wow! Signal" to within 9 degrees.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was identified on October 23, 2025. It has since been noted for its unusual characteristics, including its trajectory and composition. Prof. Loeb has analyzed these details and presented his findings in a blog post.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As of now, 3I/ATLAS appears most likely to be a natural comet. But the remote possibility of an Oberth maneuver must be considered seriously as a black swan event with a small probability because of its huge implications for humanity.”</blockquote> — Prof. Avi Loeb

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous studies of these objects have focused on their origins and compositions, with 3I/ATLAS presenting new challenges and questions for scientists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and analysis of 3I/ATLAS are expected as it continues its path through the solar system. Researchers are keen to investigate its unusual properties and how they may inform our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
