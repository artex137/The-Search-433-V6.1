      <h2>Cosmic time capsules: the search for pristine comets</h2>

<p>In a recent episode of Physics World Stories, host Andrew Glester has explored the hunt for pristine comets, focusing on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which appeared in July 2023. This investigation offers insights into the early solar system and its formation, with no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the study.</p>

<p>The search for pristine comets is significant as these icy bodies serve as time capsules, preserving materials from the solar system’s beginnings. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are currently engaged in missions that aim to study these comets, including the upcoming Comet Interceptor mission, which is set to launch in 2029.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS appeared in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Nasa’s Europa Clipper mission has focused on this comet.</li>
    <li>The Comet Interceptor mission is planned for launch in 2029.</li>
    <li>The Comet Interceptor is a joint mission between ESA and JAXA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar visitor, prompting immediate interest from mission scientists.</p>
<p>NASA's Europa Clipper mission turned its instruments towards the comet to gather data and test the spacecraft's capabilities before its journey to Europa.</p>
<p>Plans for the Comet Interceptor mission were announced, aiming to launch in 2029, which will involve deploying two probes to study a suitable comet from multiple perspectives.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This unique opportunity enables us to test the mission’s instruments before we arrive at Europa,” said Tracy Becker, deputy principal investigator for the Ultraviolet Spectrograph on NASA’s Europa Clipper mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Michael Küppers introduced the Comet Interceptor mission, highlighting its goal to study material untouched since the solar system’s birth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of comets has gained attention as scientists seek to understand the origins of the solar system. Previous missions have focused on more familiar comets that change dramatically with proximity to the Sun, but pristine comets like 3I/ATLAS offer a different perspective.</p>
<p>The collaboration between NASA, ESA, and JAXA represents a significant step in international efforts to explore and study these cosmic bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue preparations for the Comet Interceptor mission, set to launch in 2029, as they seek to gather unprecedented data on comets from the outer solar system.</p>
