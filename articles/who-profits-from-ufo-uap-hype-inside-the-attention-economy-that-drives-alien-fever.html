      <h2>Who profits from UFO/UAP hype? Inside the attention economy that drives alien fever</h2>

<p>As online debate intensifies, a growing number of individuals have turned to social media to share reports of UFO sightings, sparking a significant rise in attention surrounding these claims. This phenomenon has been particularly noticeable in recent months, with dedicated outlets like MUFON, The War Zone, and The Galileo Project amplifying these discussions. Experts like Barna Donovan, a communications professor at Saint Peter’s University in New Jersey, have noted the interplay between content creation and audience engagement in this evolving narrative.</p>

<p>This trend matters because it reflects a larger shift in how information is consumed and disseminated. Authorities and media outlets are increasingly aware that UFO stories, while often niche, can attract substantial viewer interest if presented by mainstream news channels. Donovan explains that the appetite for such stories is fed by algorithms designed to maximize viewer engagement.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>UFO sightings have gained traction on social media platforms.</li>
    <li>Dedicated outlets such as MUFON and The Galileo Project are focusing on UFO content.</li>
    <li>Barna Donovan, a communications professor, emphasizes the role of algorithms in content dissemination.</li>
    <li>Credibility issues have arisen from hoaxes, including incidents involving elaborate fake videos on Reddit.</li>
    <li>Popular media shows, like The Proof Is Out There, cover UFOs alongside other paranormal phenomena.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, social media has seen an increase in UFO sightings being reported and discussed. This has led to a surge in content created by dedicated outlets and influencers. Donovan has pointed out that the current market for UFO stories is driven by algorithms that prioritize engagement and viewer interest.</p>

<p>Despite the rise in popularity, concerns about misinformation have also emerged. Notable hoaxes, such as the “Tesla UFO” video, have created skepticism among audiences. However, the belief in UFOs persists, as many continue to seek credible information amidst a sea of dubious claims.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Along with the appetite for stories of possible alien contact comes a wariness over online hoaxes and misinformation,” said Barna Donovan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The truth about aliens is still out there, and the work of fraudsters or sloppy journalists won’t deter true believers,” Donovan added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The current fascination with UFOs is not new, but it has evolved significantly. In the past, stories about UFO sightings were often relegated to fringe media. However, the integration of these narratives into mainstream news has changed their perception. Donovan notes that journalists are now straddling the line between entertainment and informative reporting in their coverage of UFO claims.</p>

<p>The rise of platforms that encourage interactive skepticism has allowed audiences to engage with this content in new ways, further fueling interest and discussion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UFO sightings and claims are likely to continue, as both media outlets and audiences seek credible information. The ongoing challenge will be balancing viewer engagement with the need for factual reporting amid a landscape increasingly fraught with misinformation.</p>
