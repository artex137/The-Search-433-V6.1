      <h2>UAE reveals Hope Probe captured alien comet 3I/ATLAS in never-before-seen moment</h2>

<p>Dubai: The UAE Space Agency has announced that the Hope Probe has captured unique observations of comet 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach to the sun in October 2025. The findings, released on Tuesday, provide unprecedented insight into the chemistry of this interstellar object, which is only the third confirmed interstellar comet detected in our solar system.</p>

<p>The Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) has extended its mission until 2028, allowing for further scientific exploration. The observations of 3I/ATLAS, which could not be seen by Earth-based telescopes, offer a rare opportunity to study the comet's chemical composition as it disintegrated near the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet traveled at speeds of up to 246,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>It made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, at approximately 30 million km from the planet.</li>
    <li>The Hope Probe used its EXI and EMUS instruments to capture images in visible and ultraviolet wavelengths.</li>
    <li>Full scientific papers on the findings are expected in the coming months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early 2025, the global Mars science community became aware of the approaching interstellar comet. The UAE Space Agency decided to adjust the Hope Probe's mission to seize this unique observational opportunity. On October 3, 2025, the Hope Probe successfully captured images of 3I/ATLAS as it passed near Mars.</p>

<p>As the comet approached the sun, it became invisible to Earth-based telescopes. The Hope Probe, positioned at Mars, was able to observe the comet disintegrating and detected important chemical signatures, including carbon monoxide, at the moment of its closest approach to the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Anyone in the Mars community knew about this comet coming by. So, to us, it was an opportunity: how can a programme focusing purely on Mars atmosphere be repurposed to support even more?" said Mohsen Al Awadhi, director of the Space Missions Department at the UAE Space Agency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is a very rare event in the solar system to have a visitor from outside the solar system that we can actually point our scientific instruments to and understand and study,” said Dr Nora Al Saeed, principal investigator of the EMM.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it carries a chemical fingerprint different from comets formed in our solar system, suggesting formation in an alien planetary system. It follows the discovery of two other interstellar objects, 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, marking a growing interest in studying extraterrestrial materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Hope Probe will continue its extended mission, focusing on further research and analysis of the data collected from 3I/ATLAS. The UAE Space Agency plans to publish full scientific papers detailing the findings in the coming months.</p>
