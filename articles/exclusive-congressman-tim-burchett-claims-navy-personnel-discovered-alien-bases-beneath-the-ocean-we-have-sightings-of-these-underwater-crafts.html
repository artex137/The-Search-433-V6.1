      <h2>Congressman Tim Burchett Claims Navy Personnel Discovered Alien Bases Beneath the Ocean</h2>

<p>Congressman Tim Burchett has claimed that U.S. Navy personnel have reported sightings of unidentified submerged objects (USOs) near "five or six" deep-water sites globally, suggesting the possibility of alien bases beneath the ocean's surface. Burchett made these statements during an investigation into USO reports by the House Oversight Committee, which he is a member of. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities connected to these claims.</p>

<p>Burchett's assertions have raised significant interest in the ongoing discourse about UFOs and potential extraterrestrial life. The congressman stated that naval personnel have observed underwater crafts capable of speeds exceeding 640 kilometres per hour, far surpassing the capabilities of current human-made vessels. This has prompted further investigation into the nature of these sightings and the implications they might hold for national security and scientific understanding.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Congressman Tim Burchett made claims regarding USO sightings on an unspecified date.</li>
    <li>He has represented Knoxville, Tennessee, since 2019.</li>
    <li>U.S. Navy personnel reported sightings of USOs near "five or six" deep-water sites.</li>
    <li>Burchett stated these crafts can travel at speeds of hundreds of miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins testified about a sighting on September 9, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins observed a "self-luminous Tic Tac-shaped object" emerge from the ocean while aboard the USS Jackson off the coast of Southern California. This incident occurred during a congressional hearing on UFOs on September 9, 2023. Wiggins reported that the object linked up with three other similar objects before disappearing with rapid acceleration.</p>

<p>In 2022, Dr. Bill Birnes, a bestselling author, claimed that aliens may have settled on Earth centuries ago and are monitoring human evolution from underwater bases. His comments echo historical reports of mysterious crafts seen emerging from oceans, dating back to Christopher Columbus' voyage in 1492.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have naval personnel telling me that we have sightings of these underwater crafts that they're chasing,” said Burchett. “The orb then disappeared simultaneously with a high, synchronized, near-instantaneous acceleration,” testified Wiggins, describing his experience during the congressional hearing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims made by Burchett and Wiggins are part of a broader trend of increasing interest in UFOs and USOs, particularly among military personnel. Historical accounts of unidentified crafts have persisted for centuries, leading to ongoing investigations by various government entities into their nature and origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The House Oversight Committee will continue its investigation into USO sightings and the implications for national security. Further testimonies from military personnel and experts in the field are expected as inquiry progresses.</p>
