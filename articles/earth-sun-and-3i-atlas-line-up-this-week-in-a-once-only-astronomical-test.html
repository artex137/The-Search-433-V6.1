      <h2>Earth, Sun, and 3I/ATLAS Line Up This Week in a Once-Only Astronomical Test</h2>

<p>Astronomers have entered a crucial observation window this week as the comet **3I/ATLAS** aligns with the Earth and the Sun. This rare alignment, occurring from January 22 to January 29, 2026, allows scientists to gather precise data about the comet's physical characteristics through reflected light.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it compresses months of diagnostic observations into just a few days. Astronomers aim to determine whether 3I/ATLAS behaves like a typical icy comet or if its surface properties differ. The findings are expected to enhance understanding of interstellar debris and the prevalence of comet-like bodies in the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> January 22 to January 29, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Trajectory:</strong> Hyperbolic, confirming origin from beyond the solar system</li>
    <li><strong>Alignment Angle:</strong> Within 1° of the Sun and Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Focus:</strong> Changes in brightness and color of the comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, distinguished by its high velocity and hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not bound to the Sun. The comet reached perihelion in late October 2025, becoming fully active as solar heating increased its outgassing.</p>
<p>On January 22, 2026, 3I/ATLAS achieved near opposition, allowing optimal conditions for observation. This alignment will last until January 29, 2026, providing a limited window for astronomers to gather critical data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, an astronomer, noted the alignment as a rare opportunity for physical diagnosis, stating, "This configuration enhances subtle brightness effects that are otherwise difficult to measure, particularly at interstellar distances."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three confirmed interstellar objects, making it a vital subject for understanding how often icy material is ejected from planetary systems. Its hyperbolic orbit allows astronomers to measure non-gravitational accelerations attributed to outgassing, providing insights into its mass-loss rates and surface activity.</p>
<p>Initial observations revealed a temporary anti-tail and jets, aligning with behaviors seen in typical solar system comets. Subsequent infrared observations have detected emissions from water vapor and organic molecules, supporting theories about the delivery of essential ingredients for habitability to young planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the alignment period concludes, astronomers will analyze the data collected to refine their models of interstellar comets. The findings will contribute to the ongoing research published in the Research Notes of the AAS, offering insights into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and the nature of interstellar debris.</p>
