      <h2>3I/ATLAS Radio Silence And 'Impossible' Jets Push Scientists To Rethink Comets</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has prompted scientists to reconsider their understanding of comets since its discovery on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Chile. The object, a rare interstellar visitor, has shown an unusual silence and characteristics that challenge existing cometary physics. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This situation matters because it highlights significant gaps in our understanding of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. Researchers are conducting extensive studies to determine the true nature of 3I/ATLAS, as it may reshape our knowledge of comet behaviour. Two recent studies have focused on its radio emissions and size, revealing more about its characteristics while raising new questions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025, at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units (170 million miles)</li>
    <li>Object's speed: 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size: approximately 1 kilometre in diameter</li>
    <li>Radio signal search conducted over 7.25 hours on 2 July 2025</li>
    <li>Number of initial signal candidates: nearly 74 million; reduced to 211 after filtering</li>
    <li>Upper bound on potential radio transmission: 10 to 110 watts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey in Chile. Following its discovery, researchers began searching for radio signals from the object. On 2 July 2025, the Allen Telescope Array conducted a 7.25-hour search across frequencies from 1 to 9 gigahertz, initially identifying nearly 74 million signal 'hits'. After filtering, only 211 candidates remained, but ultimately no credible transmissions were detected.</p>

<p>On 19 December 2025, as 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, observations constrained any possible emissions to approximately a tenth of a watt. This finding suggests no continuous, beacon-like transmission exists from the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The search for signals from 3I/ATLAS has yielded total silence, indicating no credible transmission originating from the object,” said a spokesperson from the Allen Telescope Array.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique characteristics, including its size and the behaviour of its jets, have raised questions among researchers about the nature of interstellar bodies.</p>

<p>Previous studies have indicated that the forces acting on these objects, such as gas ejection, may not fully explain their movements. This has led to ongoing discussions about the need for revised models of cometary behaviour.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are awaiting further data from the James Webb Space Telescope, which may provide direct measurements of 3I/ATLAS's jet velocities. As studies continue, scientists hope to refine their models and gain a clearer understanding of this enigmatic interstellar visitor.</p>
