      <h2>3I/ATLAS Exocomet Captured in 28-Hour Footage by NASA’s TESS</h2>

<p>The exocomet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object detected since 1I/Oumuamua in 2017, has been recorded in a 28-hour video by NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The footage was compiled from images taken between January 15 and January 19, 2026, as the comet passed through the solar system. The closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it adds to the understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics. Researchers, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, are analyzing the footage for anomalies that could suggest the presence of extraterrestrial technology or other unusual features. The findings may influence future observations and research related to interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First spotted: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (270 million km)</li>
    <li>Video footage duration: 28 hours</li>
    <li>Video compiled by: MIT scientist Daniel Muthukrishna</li>
    <li>Next significant event: March 16, 2026, near Jupiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the Oort Cloud approximately 8,000 years ago, according to its trajectory. It was first identified by the ATLAS observatory on July 1, 2025. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025. Following its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, TESS recorded images of the comet from January 15 to January 19, 2026. These images were later stitched together to create a continuous 28-hour video.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has stated that the comet appears as a bright dot with an anti-tail directed toward the Sun. He, along with collaborator Toni Scarmato, plans to investigate the video for signs of periodic brightness variations and wobbling of the anti-tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "3I/ATLAS appears as a bright glowing dot with an anti-tail directed towards the Sun," said Avi Loeb in his Medium blog.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "The next highlight would involve the passage of 3I/ATLAS near the Hill radius of Jupiter on March 16, 2026," Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object recorded, following 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of such objects has gained momentum in recent years, prompting increased interest from the scientific community regarding their origins and implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the upcoming passage of 3I/ATLAS near Jupiter on March 16, 2026, the Juno spacecraft will observe it from a distance of 53.6 million kilometers. Researchers hope to gather more data that could provide insights into the comet's composition and behavior.</p>
