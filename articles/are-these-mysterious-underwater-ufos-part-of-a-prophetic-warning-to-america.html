      <h2>Are These Mysterious Underwater UFOs Part of a Prophetic Warning to America?</h2>

<p>Thousands of underwater UFOs, referred to as Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs), have been reported in waterways across the United States, according to a UFO-tracking app. The New York Post reported these sightings have raised concerns about national security. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these sightings.</p>

<p>The emergence of these USOs matters as they are increasingly recognized as a potential risk to national security. Authorities are now evaluating the implications of these sightings. The UFO-tracking app, Enigma, claims to maintain the largest database of global UFO sightings and has recorded over 30,000 UFOs and UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) since 2022, with significant activity noted near U.S. coastlines.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enigma has reported over 30,000 UFOs and UAPs since 2022.</li>
    <li>More than 9,000 sightings are within 10 miles of U.S. shorelines or major bodies of water.</li>
    <li>Florida and California have recorded the highest number of sightings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since 2022, Enigma has documented a surge in UFO sightings across various locations. The sightings have included both aerial and underwater phenomena, with a noted increase in reports near major water bodies.</p>
<p>As reports continue to emerge, authorities are assessing the implications for national security and public safety.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While these reports of thousands of underwater UFOs may spark fear or fascination, they also serve as a reminder that in the last days, deception will increase in both the natural and supernatural realms,” according to a report by the New York Post.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This increase in UFO sightings aligns with a broader trend of heightened public interest in unidentified aerial and submersible phenomena. Past incidents have prompted discussions about security and the need for transparency regarding unidentified objects in U.S. airspace and waterways.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating these sightings to determine any potential threats. Further updates will be provided as more information becomes available.</p>
