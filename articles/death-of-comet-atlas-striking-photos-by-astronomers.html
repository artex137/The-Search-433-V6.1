      <h2>Death of Comet ATLAS: Striking Photos by Astronomers</h2>

<p>The National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOIRLab) has reported the disintegration of the nucleus of comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS), as captured in stunning images taken by the Gemini North telescope. The images were published on January 30, 2026, and show the comet's fragmentation after its close encounter with the Sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the end of the comet's journey, which began when it was discovered in May 2025 by the ATLAS system, a network of robotic telescopes. Astronomers are analyzing the images to understand more about the comet's composition and the effects of solar radiation on its structure.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery: C/2025 K1 ATLAS was discovered in May 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion: The comet passed perihelion on October 8, 2025, at a distance of 0.33 AU (50 million km) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Fragmentation: The nucleus began to fragment in November 2025.</li>
    <li>Images: The first image showing three fragments was taken on November 11, 2025; a subsequent image on December 6, 2025, showed four fragments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2025, astronomers identified C/2025 K1 ATLAS using the ATLAS system. The comet traveled from the Oort Cloud, an area populated with icy bodies at the solar system's edge. On October 8, 2025, it reached perihelion, surprising scientists with a rare golden color due to its unique chemical composition.</p>

<p>Despite initial concerns over its fragility, the comet survived perihelion but sustained significant damage from solar radiation. By November 2025, astronomers noted that the nucleus had started to fragment. Images captured on November 11 and December 6 documented the shifting positions and brightness of the fragments, offering a breathtaking display in the night sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The images reveal the dramatic changes in the comet’s nucleus, showcasing a celestial spectacle that has captivated astronomers,” said a representative from NOIRLab.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>C/2025 K1 ATLAS is part of a broader understanding of comets originating from the Oort Cloud. This area is known for producing long-period comets that can provide insights into the early solar system. The ATLAS system has previously discovered other significant celestial objects, including the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to analyze the data and images of C/2025 K1 ATLAS to learn more about its composition and the processes that led to its disintegration. Further studies may enhance understanding of comet behavior and the dynamics of solar interactions.</p>
