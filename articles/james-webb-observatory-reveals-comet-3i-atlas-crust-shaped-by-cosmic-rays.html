      <h2>James Webb Observatory reveals comet 3I/Atlas crust shaped by cosmic rays</h2>

<p>Scientists using the Telescópio Espacial James Webb (JWST) have identified a radiant crust, between 15 and 20 meters deep, on the surface of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which was studied in August 2025 at a distance of 445 million kilometers from Earth. This unique formation is attributed to billions of years of exposure to galactic cosmic rays as the comet traveled through the Milky Way before its approach to our solar system.</p>

<p>The research, coordinated by experts from the Royal Belgian Institute of Space Aeronomy, reveals significant transformations on the comet's surface, including the conversion of carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide. This discovery sheds light on the comet's history and composition, emphasizing the effects of prolonged radiation on celestial bodies from other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object observed.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed exceeding 210,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide emissions in the core reached 129 kg per second.</li>
    <li>Scientists recorded a CO2/H2O ratio of 7.6 ± 0.3, the highest ever in comets.</li>
    <li>The comet's diameter is estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025, near the constellation Sagittarius.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025, and initial activity was observed in May 2025 when it was still 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun. The comet was meticulously studied in August 2025, revealing its unique surface characteristics. It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, leading to a significant sublimation process that exposed internal layers and altered its surface chemistry.</p>

<p>Following perihelion, the luminosity of 3I/Atlas increased rapidly, displaying a bluish hue as volatile gases were released. The James Webb’s NIRSpec instrument was crucial for detecting high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the comet's coma, further confirming its unique composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The analysis reinforces how prolonged radiation can profoundly modify objects on interstellar trajectories,” said a spokesperson from the Royal Belgian Institute of Space Aeronomy.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas provide essential insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies outside our solar system. Unlike solar comets, which are protected by the heliosphere, 3I/Atlas has experienced significant surface alterations due to its exposure to cosmic rays over billions of years. This distinction is crucial for understanding the differences between interstellar and solar system objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it recedes from the Sun. Ground-based telescopes will provide essential data to improve models of cometary evolution and emission patterns for objects exposed to prolonged radiation.</p>
