      <h2>What is Delta-V problem and could we ever visit 3I/ATLAS comet?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 1 July 2025, is moving through the Solar System at an estimated speed of 58 km/s relative to the Sun. This speed makes it one of the fastest comets observed, and it is on a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it is not bound to the Sun and will not return.</p>

<p>This situation raises questions about humanity's ability to visit such interstellar objects. Current spacecraft technology is not equipped to intercept 3I/ATLAS due to the significant delta-V, or change in velocity, required to meet its trajectory. Authorities are exploring future mission architectures that could allow for better detection and response to similar interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System at 58 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>It is on a hyperbolic trajectory and will not return to the Solar System.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The fastest spacecraft, Parker Solar Probe, reached 180 km/s near the Sun.</li>
    <li>Current rockets cannot match 3I/ATLAS’s incoming speed on short notice.</li>
    <li>Interstellar missions require delta-V budgets significantly higher than previous missions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025, after it had already entered the inner Solar System. By this time, it had passed the region where a spacecraft could have reasonably intercepted it. Following its perihelion around late October 2025, the comet began to accelerate away from the Sun, further increasing the difficulty of any potential interception.</p>

<p>As it escaped the Solar System, its distance from Earth increased rapidly, making a late intercept virtually impossible with current propulsion technology. No spacecraft were in position or capable of matching its speed or trajectory when it was discovered.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To physically reach one in the future, humanity must build faster spacecraft and keep them waiting in advance, long before the next interstellar visitor arrives,” experts have noted regarding the challenges of future missions to interstellar objects.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous missions, such as New Horizons and Rosetta, required years of planning and preparation. The inability to intercept 3I/ATLAS highlights the importance of early detection for interstellar objects. The lack of a ready spacecraft during its appearance in the Solar System underscores the current limitations in space exploration technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) and other organizations are proposing the development of “Interstellar Sentinel” missions that would involve parking high-speed interceptors in deep space for rapid response to future interstellar objects.</p>
