      <h2>UFO Cloud Appears in Yeongbuk, Gangwon Province</h2>
<p>Last weekend, a so-called "UFO cloud" appeared in the sky over Yeongbuk, Gangwon Province, drawing attention from locals and observers. The cloud was reported in the afternoon of October 31, 2023, specifically in Sokcho City and Yangyang County.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has prompted explanations from the Korea Meteorological Administration, which clarified the nature of the cloud. Authorities emphasized the cloud’s unique formation, which is attributed to specific weather conditions and topography in the region.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 31, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Yeongbuk, Gangwon Province (Sokcho City and Yangyang County)</li>
    <li>Weather conditions: Generally clear skies with few other clouds</li>
    <li>Type of cloud: Lens cloud</li>
    <li>Cause: Strong airflow across mountainous terrain</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 31, 2023, flat and smooth plate-shaped clouds were observed floating in the sky near Seoraksan National Park. The unusual appearance of the cloud drew attention as it contrasted with the otherwise clear weather.</p>

<p>The Korea Meteorological Administration later identified the cloud as a "lens cloud," explaining its formation due to the interaction of cold air with the mountainous landscape.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>The Korea Meteorological Administration explained that this cloud is a "lens cloud" formed by the combination of mountainous terrain and weather conditions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lens clouds usually appear when the airflow across the mountain range is strong, leading to unique formations that resemble a dish or UFO.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Lens clouds are a known meteorological phenomenon that often occurs in mountainous regions, particularly when strong winds interact with the terrain. The Yeongbuk area, situated between the east coast and Seoraksan Mountain, frequently experiences such formations due to its geographical features.</p>

<p>This type of cloud is typically not associated with precipitation, allowing it to be visible even in predominantly clear weather conditions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no ongoing investigations or further actions planned regarding this cloud formation, as the phenomenon has been clarified by meteorological experts.</p>
