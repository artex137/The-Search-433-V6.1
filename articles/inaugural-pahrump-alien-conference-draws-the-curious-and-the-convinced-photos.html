      <h2>Inaugural Pahrump Alien Conference draws the curious and the convinced</h2>

<p>Approximately 600 attendees gathered at the Pahrump Nugget Hotel and Casino on Saturday, Oct. 25, for the inaugural Pahrump Alien Conference, featuring expert speakers, UFO sightings, and alien merchandise. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The conference, organized by ufologist Joseph De La Torre, aimed to explore the mysteries of extraterrestrial life. De La Torre claims to have photographed thousands of UFOs and believes Pahrump is a hotspot for such sightings due to its proximity to Area 51. Local authorities have not disclosed any official involvement in the event.</p>
