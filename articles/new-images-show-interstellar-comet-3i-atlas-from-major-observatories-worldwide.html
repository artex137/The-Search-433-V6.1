      <h2>New images show interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from major observatories worldwide</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected an interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, passing through our solar system, with new images captured from major observatories around the world. This marks only the third time in recorded history that such an object has been confirmed, following the previous sightings of 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet is currently visible and is expected to provide significant insights into cosmic matter from outside our solar neighborhood.</p>

<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS offers astronomers a rare opportunity to study an object from another star system. Observatories, including the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, the Very Large Telescope in Chile, and NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, are collaborating to gather as much data as possible. Scientists emphasize the importance of this event, as interstellar comets do not return to the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at over <strong>97,000 miles per hour</strong>.</li>
<li>It is expected to make its closest approach in <strong>late 2024</strong>.</li>
<li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object detected.</li>
<li>The comet is not gravitationally bound to the solar system.</li>
<li>Observatories involved include the <strong>Keck Observatory</strong>, <strong>Very Large Telescope</strong>, and <strong>NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope</strong>.</li>
<li>Initial observations suggest the presence of volatile elements like <strong>carbon monoxide</strong> and <strong>methane-based ices</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in <strong>2024</strong>. Since its discovery, a collaborative effort among various observatories has been underway to capture high-resolution images and conduct spectroscopic analysis. The comet's hyperbolic orbit has confirmed that it originates from outside the solar system, ruling out any solar origin.</p>

<p>As of now, astronomers are racing against time to gather data on the comet's composition, mass, spin, and activity before it moves beyond observational reach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We only get a brief window with objects like 3I/ATLAS,” noted Dr. Maria Elkins, an astrophysicist at the European Southern Observatory. “Unlike comets originating in the Oort Cloud or Kuiper Belt, interstellar comets will never return, so everything we want to learn has to be captured right now.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If we’re lucky, 3I/ATLAS will help bridge the gap between native solar system bodies and material forged in an alien environment,” said Dr. Eliza Wilmot, lead researcher at Keck.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of interstellar objects has been extremely rare, with 3I/ATLAS following the historic discoveries of 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Each of these objects has offered unique insights into the characteristics of cosmic bodies from other star systems. The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS aims to enhance our understanding of the diversity of materials found in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS until it fades from view, with plans to analyze its composition and characteristics. The upcoming activation of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in 2025 is expected to increase the detection rate of interstellar objects, providing more opportunities for research in the future.</p>
