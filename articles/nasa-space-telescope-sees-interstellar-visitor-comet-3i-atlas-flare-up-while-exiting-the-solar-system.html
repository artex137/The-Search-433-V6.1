      <h2>NASA space telescope sees interstellar visitor comet 3I/ATLAS flare up while exiting the solar system</h2>

<p>NASA's SPHEREx space telescope has captured dramatic images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS brightening as it exits the solar system, two months after its closest approach to the sun in December 2025.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study the chemical composition of materials formed around another star. The data collected by SPHEREx reveals a surge of gas, dust, and complex molecules being released from the comet, offering insights into the origins of planetary systems and potentially life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun occurred in October 2025.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx observations took place in December 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet has released water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, methanol, and cyanide.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS asteroid survey. The comet made its closest approach to the sun in October 2025. By December 2025, SPHEREx captured images of the comet as it intensified its activity while heading back out of the inner solar system.</p>

<p>The observations revealed a pear-shaped dust tail and a glowing coma rich in various chemical compounds. This indicates that the comet did not fade quietly but instead erupted with activity after its perihelion, challenging previous assumptions about comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, after its close flyby of the sun, causing it to significantly brighten," said Carey Lisse, lead author of the study. "Even water ice was quickly sublimating into gas in interplanetary space."</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Since comets consist of about one-third bulk water ice, it was releasing an abundance of new, carbon-rich material that had remained locked in ice deep below the surface," Lisse added.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>"The comet has spent ages traversing interstellar space, being bombarded by highly energetic cosmic rays, and has likely formed a crust that's been processed by that radiation," noted Phil Korngut, co-author of the study.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS has displayed an extended chemical activity, providing a rare opportunity to compare local comets with those formed around other stars.</p>

<p>The findings from the SPHEREx observations, published in February 2026 in the journal Research Notes of the AAS, highlight the significance of studying the chemistry of interstellar objects to understand the building blocks of planets and life in the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data gathered from SPHEREx to further understand the chemical composition of comet 3I/ATLAS and its implications for planetary formation across the galaxy.</p>
