      <h2>Are all the anomalies explained by interstellar origin? Secrets of comet 3I/ATLAS revealed</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey system in Chile, has garnered attention for its unusual behavior, according to Gennady Krasnikov, President of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In an interview with RIA Novosti, Krasnikov explained that the comet's behavior is due to its origin outside the Solar System, effectively dispelling speculation about it being an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>This explanation matters because it clarifies the comet's characteristics and reassures the public regarding safety. Authorities have confirmed that the comet passed at a safe distance from both Earth and the Sun, with no associated dangers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile.</li>
    <li>Comet is over 7.5 billion years old, approximately 3 billion years older than the Sun.</li>
    <li>Passed perihelion in late October 2025 at a distance of roughly 1.4 AU.</li>
    <li>Third confirmed interstellar object after 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
    <li>Confirmed safe passage with zero danger to Earth or the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey system. It exhibited unusual characteristics such as changes in rotation speed and color. In late October 2025, the comet passed perihelion at a safe distance. Following its discovery, Gennady Krasnikov provided scientific explanations for its behavior, attributing it to the comet's interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Comet 3I/ATLAS was not from our Solar System and therefore had not been exposed to the strong influence of our Sun. As a result, it behaved somewhat unusually — its rotation speed changed, and so did its color,” said Krasnikov.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Krasnikov also stated, “The excitement surrounding such a mysterious object is understandable, but science provides clear answers: this is a typical — albeit very ancient — comet from another star system.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Interstellar comets are rare and provide valuable data about primordial materials and the formation of stars and planets across the galaxy. The behavior of such objects can differ significantly from comets originating within the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey back into interstellar space, scientists will analyze data collected during its passage to gain deeper insights into its composition and the nature of ancient comets.</p>
