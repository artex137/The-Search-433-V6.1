      <h2>Scientist issues a frightening update on 3I/Atlas warning it is ‘not natural’</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/Atlas, detected on July 1, is travelling towards Earth at 209,215 kilometres per hour (130,000 mph), raising concerns among scientists and the public. NASA has reported that the object does not behave like a typical comet, prompting speculation about its nature and origin.</p>

<p>This development has prompted NASA to add 3I/Atlas to the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), classifying it as a potential planetary threat. Astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has suggested that the object could be an "alien mothership," indicating that it exhibits behaviours not characteristic of natural comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Detection date: July 1</li>
    <li>Speed: 209,215 kilometres per hour (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li>Classification: Possible planetary threat</li>
    <li>Assessment by Dr. Avi Loeb: Likelihood of non-natural origin is 30-40%</li>
    <li>Unique materials identified: Nickel tetracarbonyl and a metal composite not typically found in comets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first detected on July 1. Since then, NASA has monitored its trajectory and behaviour, noting that it does not conform to expected comet characteristics. Dr. Loeb has publicly shared his analysis, raising concerns about the object's potential technological origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Currently, I give 3I/ATLAS a 6 on that scale, but my assessment will change as we get better data on it when it comes closer to the Sun,” said Dr. Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The alloy has previously been witnessed only in human manufacturing,” Dr. Loeb added regarding the materials released by 3I/Atlas.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a growing interest in interstellar objects, particularly after the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017, which also prompted discussions about non-natural origins. NASA's inclusion of 3I/Atlas in the IAWN reflects an increased vigilance towards potential threats from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and global astronomers will continue to gather data on 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun. Ongoing observations may clarify the object's nature and origin, with updates expected as more information becomes available.</p>
