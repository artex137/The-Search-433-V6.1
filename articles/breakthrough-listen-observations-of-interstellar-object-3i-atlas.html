      <h2>Breakthrough Listen Observations of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been observed by the Breakthrough Listen Initiative since its discovery on July 1, 2025. No evidence has emerged to suggest that it is anything other than a natural astrophysical object. The observations have continued through its closest approach to Earth, which occurred on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This research is significant due to the rarity of interstellar objects, with only three known to date. Authorities have undertaken extensive studies to explore the possibility of technosignatures, which could indicate extraterrestrial intelligence. Breakthrough Listen has utilized multiple facilities worldwide to conduct these observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 1.7 AU (167 million miles)</li>
    <li>Observation Facilities: Allen Telescope Array, MeerKAT, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Murriyang Parkes Radio Telescope, Green Bank Telescope</li>
    <li>No artificial radio emissions detected</li>
    <li>Data sensitivity ranged from 0.1 W to 110 W EIRP</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025. Observations using the Allen Telescope Array began within days of its discovery, focusing on frequencies of 1 - 9 GHz. The MeerKAT telescope also recorded data, detecting signatures of hydroxyl on July 31, September 12, and October 5, 2025.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2025, the Green Bank Telescope conducted observations less than 24 hours before the closest approach. The observations aimed to maximize sensitivity to potential technosignatures. Throughout this period, no artificial emissions have been detected from 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS continues to behave as expected from natural astrophysical processes. It remains an extremely interesting target for observation given the overall rarity of interstellar objects.” - Breakthrough Listen Initiative</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects are rare, with only three confirmed to date. The study of such objects is crucial for understanding the dynamics of our solar system and the potential for extraterrestrial life. Breakthrough Listen's ongoing observations align with its mission to conduct sensitive searches for technosignatures across the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Breakthrough Listen Initiative will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as part of a broader strategy to investigate interstellar objects. The results from ongoing data analysis and observations will be shared with the scientific community once finalized.</p>
