      <h2>NASA Launches Sounding Rocket, Dismisses UFO Sightings</h2>
<p>NASA has scheduled a launch of its sounding rocket mission, the Turbulent Oxygen Mixing Experiment Plus (TOMEX+), from Wallops Island, Virginia, between 10 p.m. on August 25 and 3 a.m. on August 26. This mission has sparked speculation among sky gazers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, who may see a flash in the sky. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The TOMEX+ mission is significant for scientific research, aiming to collect data on the mesopause, which is a layer of the upper atmosphere. NASA officials have clarified that the expected sightings are not UFOs but rather part of the rocket launch. The agency has stated that this mission is crucial for understanding atmospheric dynamics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mission Name:</strong> Turbulent Oxygen Mixing Experiment Plus (TOMEX+)</li>
    <li><strong>Launch Date:</strong> August 25, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Launch Window:</strong> 10 p.m. to 3 a.m.</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Southern New Jersey: 10-30 seconds after launch; Northern New Jersey: 30-40 seconds after launch</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Attempts:</strong> Multiple attempts this month hindered by weather conditions</li>
    <li><strong>Mission Window:</strong> Through September 3, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The TOMEX+ mission has faced several launch attempts this month. Each attempt has been postponed due to adverse weather conditions, including cloud cover and high sea states caused by Hurricane Erin. NASA has continued to monitor these conditions as they prepare for the upcoming launch.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The TOMEX+ mission is a priority for research, as it targets the mesopause, the coldest layer of our atmosphere,” NASA officials said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “What you may see in the sky is not a UFO but a NASA rocket,” a spokesperson emphasized.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Sounding rockets are used to carry scientific instruments into space for brief periods, typically between five to 20 minutes. NASA has been launching sounding rockets for over 40 years from various locations worldwide, primarily from the Wallops Flight Facility. This mission is particularly important as it aims to gather data from a region that is too high for weather balloons and too low for satellites.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will proceed with the launch attempt on August 25, provided weather conditions permit. The agency will continue to assess conditions leading up to the launch and will provide updates as necessary.</p>
