      <h2>Hubble and JUICE Reveal New Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope and the JUICE spacecraft of the European Space Agency have released new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth this month. The comet, discovered in July 2023, has drawn significant interest from scientists due to its interstellar origins.</p>

<p>Authorities are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS, which is the third interstellar object prioritized for study. Investigations aim to determine its trajectory and provide insights into its chemical composition as it approaches the Sun. This close approach is expected to occur on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach a distance of approximately <strong>270 million kilometers</strong> from Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Hubble first observed the comet in July 2023.</li>
    <li>JUICE is currently about <strong>66 million kilometers</strong> from 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>JUICE launched in 2023 and is expected to arrive at Jupiter in <strong>2031</strong>.</li>
    <li>High-resolution data from JUICE is anticipated between February 18 and 20, 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered as it moved through our stellar neighborhood in July 2023. Hubble captured detailed images of the comet shortly after its discovery. In early November 2023, JUICE, on its way to Jupiter, began taking close-up images of the comet, utilizing its scientific instruments to study its activity. The most recent images were taken on November 30, 2023, revealing the comet's coma and two distinct tails.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The images show significant heating and activity around the comet as it approaches the Sun,” a spokesperson for the JUICE mission said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to be studied in detail. Previous investigations into interstellar comets have helped scientists understand their origins and the conditions of the early solar system. Comets typically have a coma and two tails, which are formed from the gases and dust released as they approach the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists expect to receive most of JUICE’s data by February 2024, which will include high-resolution images and detailed analysis of the comet's composition, aiding in the understanding of its origins.</p>
