      <h2>Expert warns people to 'brace ourselves' as mystery 'alien spaceship' to reach Earth tomorrow</h2>

<p>A theoretical physicist has suggested that the mysterious comet 3I/ATLAS will reach Earth tomorrow, October 29. The comet, identified by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, is the third interstellar object to enter our solar system in recorded history. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This prediction has garnered attention from researchers and the public alike. Authorities are monitoring the comet’s trajectory and behaviour, which has included unusual features like a tail and an anti-tail. Harvard's Avi Loeb has proposed that the comet may not be a naturally formed object, raising questions about its origins and potential implications for Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach Earth on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Identified by NASA ATLAS on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object in recorded history.</li>
    <li>Harvard researchers, including Avi Loeb, have published theories about the comet.</li>
    <li>Unusual behaviour has been observed, including the formation of a tail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, researchers at NASA's ATLAS identified the comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, it has sparked significant interest within the scientific community. Avi Loeb and his colleagues have suggested a possibility that the comet could be an artificial object, prompting discussions about its potential implications.</p>

<p>In recent days, the comet has exhibited unusual behaviour, including the development of a tail and an anti-tail. Loeb has emphasized that October 29 is a crucial date, as it coincides with the comet's perihelion, the point at which it is closest to the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The hypothesis in question is that [3I/ATLAS] is a technological artefact, and furthermore has active intelligence," Loeb stated in a paper with fellow researchers Adam Hibberd and Adam Crowl.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "If you want to take a vacation, take it before [October 29], because who knows what will happen?" Loeb advised in a video interview.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, interstellar objects have been a topic of intrigue in the scientific community. The recognition of such objects raises questions about the nature of our universe and the potential for extraterrestrial life. Loeb's theories about 3I/ATLAS contribute to ongoing discussions about the existence of advanced civilizations beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches its perihelion, researchers will continue to monitor its behaviour and trajectory. Authorities and scientists will assess the implications of the comet's characteristics and any potential interactions with Earth.</p>
