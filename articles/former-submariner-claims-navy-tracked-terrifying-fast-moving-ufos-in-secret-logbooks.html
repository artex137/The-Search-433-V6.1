      <h2>Former submariner claims Navy tracked 'terrifying' fast-moving UFOs in secret logbooks</h2>

<p>A former submariner has claimed that the US Navy has maintained secret logbooks documenting the movements of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) across the oceans at high speeds. The allegations surfaced after a 2024 document revealed 21 unexplained UFO sightings, which the US government acknowledged following a report from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).</p>

<p>The claims raise questions about the Navy's tracking of unidentified aerial and submerged objects (UASOs) and the government's response to these phenomena. AARO has stated that it is working with the Intelligence Community and Science and Technology partners to analyze these reported cases further.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In 2024, a document revealed 21 unexplained UFO sightings.</li>
    <li>The report was acknowledged by the US government after submission to Congress by AARO.</li>
    <li>The sightings included various objects, some identified as balloons, birds, and satellites.</li>
    <li>Outstanding sightings include the 'GOFAST' footage and a rapidly moving silver sphere filmed in the Middle East.</li>
    <li>AARO has found no evidence of extraterrestrial beings or advanced foreign technologies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2024, a document surfaced detailing 21 unexplained UFO sightings. The report was provided to Congress by the AARO, which has been tasked with investigating these phenomena.</p>

<p>A Reddit user named Dabier, who claims to have worked with a retired Cold War submariner, shared insights about the Navy's logbooks. He indicated that unidentified contacts were recorded in a logbook used by sonar operators.</p>

<p>According to Dabier, some entries described objects moving quickly without identifiable sources for their sounds, while others produced unnatural noises. The fate of the logbook entries after being sent off the submarines remains unclear.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>AARO stated: "It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology."</blockquote>

<blockquote>AARO added: "None of these resolved cases substantiated advanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mike Gold, formerly NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Policy, cautioned the House of Representatives: "The truth is out there." He urged NASA to take action on tracking potential UFO flight paths.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent claims about the Navy's logbooks and the UFO sightings contribute to a growing body of evidence regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). Prior incidents have included various documented sightings, some of which have been explained, while several remain unresolved.</p>

<p>The AARO has been established to investigate these incidents and report findings to Congress, aiming to better understand the nature and origin of such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO continues to work with its partners to analyze the 21 unexplained cases and will notify Congress if any findings suggest a breakthrough in foreign adversarial aerospace capability.</p>
