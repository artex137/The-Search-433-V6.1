      <h2>CIA Records on Comet 3I/ATLAS Are 'Properly Classified' to Protect National Security</h2>

<p>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has classified records related to Comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile on July 1, 2025. The CIA's action has sparked public debate and speculation regarding the nature of the comet and its implications for national security.</p>

<p>This classification has raised questions about transparency and the government's rationale for treating information about 3I/ATLAS as a state secret. In a response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from researcher John Greenewald Jr. in November 2025, the CIA stated it could "neither deny nor confirm the existence or nonexistence of such records." This has led to concerns about the potential risks associated with the comet, despite NASA's assertion that it is a natural celestial object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Identified by: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>CIA response date: December 31, 2025</li>
    <li>NASA's classification: Natural comet</li>
    <li>Comet size estimate: Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers wide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, ATLAS in Chile discovered Comet 3I/ATLAS. NASA quickly categorized it as a natural object, dismissing claims of extraterrestrial origin. Significant public interest grew following the CIA's response to a FOIA request in November 2025, where it opted for a "Glomar" response. This response indicated that the agency could not confirm or deny the existence of records related to the comet. On December 31, 2025, the CIA stated that the classification of such records was a matter of national security.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself currently and properly classified and is intelligence sources and methods information protected from disclosure,”</blockquote>
<p>— CIA statement, December 31, 2025.</p>

<blockquote>“That this information is treated as sensitive enough to be classified by the CIA is surprising, given that NASA officials stated decisively... that 3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin,”</blockquote>
<p>— Avi Loeb, Harvard scientist.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The public has generally accepted the scientific community's consensus that it is a natural comet. However, the CIA's classification has introduced uncertainty, leading to speculation about the government's motives.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has suggested that the object may contain anomalies warranting further investigation. He has raised concerns about the potential for a "black swan" event, which could have significant consequences if the comet were to pose an unexpected threat.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As NASA continues to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS, the CIA's classification remains in place. It is unclear if or when additional information about the comet will be released to the public.</p>
