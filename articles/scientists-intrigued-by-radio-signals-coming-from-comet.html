      <h2>Scientists Intrigued by Radio Signals Coming From Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has detected intriguing radio signals emanating from Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks during its latest approach to the Sun in 2023. The discovery was detailed in a paper published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, led by researchers from the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>This finding matters because it enhances the understanding of cometary activity and the early solar system. The research indicates that Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks is more active than other Halley-type comets, which could provide insights into the origins of water on Earth and the conditions for life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks was first discovered in 1812.</li>
    <li>It visits Earth approximately every 71 years.</li>
    <li>Last closest approach was in 1954; next approach is expected in 2024.</li>
    <li>During its 2023 approach, the comet released over five tons of water vapor.</li>
    <li>Ammonia molecules have been detected in the comet for the first time.</li>
    <li>The research was conducted using the Tianma Radio Telescope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks has a long observational history, first discovered in 1812. It has been observed during its periodic approaches to the Sun, with significant observations made during its latest approach in 2023. Researchers utilized data from the Tianma Radio Telescope to analyze the comet's activity, revealing the presence of hydroxyl and ammonia molecules.</p>

<p>Prior to this, a team from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center led by Martin Cordiner found evidence that the water from Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks shares an isotopic signature similar to that of Earth's water, suggesting a potential connection between comets and the development of habitable conditions on Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The possible detection of [ammonia] during an outburst suggests possible connections between the subsurface volatile reservoir and the outburst mechanism,” the researchers concluded in their paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Our new results provide the strongest evidence yet that at least some Halley-type comets carried water with the same isotopic signature as that found on Earth, supporting the idea that comets could have helped make our planet habitable,” Martin Cordiner said in a statement earlier this year.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks is classified as a Halley-type comet, which typically has an orbital period between 20 and 200 years. The study of such comets is crucial as they can provide insights into the early solar system and the origins of water and organic compounds on Earth. The detection of ammonia in 12P signals a broader trend in comet research, focusing on the chemical compositions that may have contributed to the emergence of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks during its next approach in 2024 to gather more data on its outgassing activity and composition.</p>
