      <h2>Age of Disclosure Director Dan Farah Says Marco Rubio Is 'Seriously Concerned' About UAPs</h2>

<p>Director Dan Farah of the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> has stated that former Senator Marco Rubio expressed serious concerns about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) during an interview. Farah reported this on October 9, 2023, as he discussed the film, which explores the implications of UAPs and the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<p>The documentary highlights the belief among some U.S. officials that the government has possessed extraterrestrial technology since at least the 1947 Roswell incident. Farah asserts that this has led to a secretive race between the U.S. and adversarial nations like Russia and China to reverse-engineer such technology. The film has gained significant attention, breaking records on Prime Video and being viewed by members of Congress.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Farah interviewed Senator Marco Rubio, then vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.</li>
    <li>The film features interviews with 34 high-ranking military, government, and intelligence officials.</li>
    <li>It explores an alleged 80-year cover-up regarding non-human intelligent life.</li>
    <li>Key politicians featured include Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Rep. André Carson, and Sen. Mike Rounds.</li>
    <li>The documentary is currently available on Amazon Prime.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, the Roswell incident is believed to have marked the beginning of U.S. possession of extraterrestrial technology. In the years since, various officials have claimed that this technology remains a subject of covert interest among U.S. adversaries. In 2023, Dan Farah interviews Rubio and other officials for <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, shedding light on the ongoing secrecy surrounding UAPs.</p>

<p>Farah describes Rubio as having been extremely informed about UAPs during his time on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Following his Senate career, Rubio became the acting National Security Advisor in the Trump Administration, potentially gaining access to even more classified information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I’m sitting three feet away from him doing the interview, and I felt it — I felt how unbelievably seriously concerned he was,” said Farah about his conversation with Rubio.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If their approach to it is driven by science and a desire to match what they think is ours, we’ll wake up one day and realize, ‘I don’t know how they got there, but they got there ahead of us, and now we’re screwed,'” Rubio stated in the film.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I interviewed 34 very high-level military, government and intelligence officials who collectively break their silence to reveal that there’s been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human, intelligent life,” Farah explained.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The film's release coincides with a growing bipartisan call for transparency regarding UAPs. Lawmakers from both parties, including Rubio and Gillibrand, emphasize the need for the public to be informed about the government's knowledge of UAPs. This reflects a broader trend of increasing interest and scrutiny of UAP phenomena in recent years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the release of <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, further discussions about UAPs in Congress are expected. The film may encourage more officials to advocate for transparency regarding UAP-related information and its implications for U.S. national security.</p>
