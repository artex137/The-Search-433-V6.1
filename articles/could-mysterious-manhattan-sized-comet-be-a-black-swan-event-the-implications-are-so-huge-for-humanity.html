      <h2>Could mysterious Manhattan-sized comet be a ‘black swan event?’</h2>

<p>NASA's International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has launched an emergency defense probe after 3I/ATLAS, a Manhattan-sized interstellar object, exhibited unusual behavior earlier this week. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the implications of this comet for humanity, suggesting it could be an extraterrestrial “Trojan horse.”</p>

<p>This development is significant as authorities work to monitor and assess the comet's trajectory and behavior. The IAWN has initiated a comet campaign set to run from November 27, 2025, through January 27, 2026, to refine methods for pinpointing ATLAS' exact location. Loeb has claimed that the comet's unusual characteristics warrant increased vigilance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: Estimated to be the size of Manhattan</li>
    <li>Estimated weight: 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Monitoring period: November 27, 2025 – January 27, 2026</li>
    <li>Unusual behaviors: Anti-tail and plume of nickel observed</li>
    <li>NASA's position: No current threat identified</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered, prompting initial interest in its characteristics. Following its unusual behavior observed earlier this week, the IAWN launched a defense probe to monitor the object. The comet's closest approach to the Sun is imminent, raising further concerns about its trajectory and possible implications.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “It’s at least a thousand times more massive than the previous interstellar objects we’ve seen.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, “If 3I/ATLAS is a massive mothership, it will likely continue along its original gravitational path and ultimately exit the Solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects have typically been smaller, leading scientists to question the implications of a much larger entity like 3I/ATLAS. The unusual behaviors and characteristics of this comet have prompted discussions about its potential origin and intentions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS to assess its trajectory and behavior. Further investigations may follow based on the outcomes of the ongoing monitoring campaign.</p>
