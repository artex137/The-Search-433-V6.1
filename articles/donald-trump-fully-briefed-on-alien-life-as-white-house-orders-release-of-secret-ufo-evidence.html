      <h2>Donald Trump 'Fully Briefed' on Alien Life as White House Orders Release of Secret UFO Evidence</h2>

<p>Congressman Eric Burlison has claimed that the Trump administration has directed the Department of Defense to facilitate congressional visits to restricted locations linked to UFO programs. Burlison made the statement during an interview on the Aliens Last Night podcast on January 30, 2023.</p>

<p>This development has raised questions about transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities are under pressure to provide more information to the public about potential evidence of extraterrestrial life. Burlison, a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, argues that access to these sites could reveal significant findings, including unusual aircraft and non-human bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> January 30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> United States</li>
    <li><strong>Key Figure:</strong> Congressman Eric Burlison (Republican, Missouri)</li>
    <li><strong>Agency Involved:</strong> Department of Defense (DoD)</li>
    <li><strong>Claims:</strong> Burlison asserts Trump has been "fully briefed" on alien life and related matters.</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Testimony:</strong> Former intelligence official David Grusch testified about UAP crash retrievals in July 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, David Grusch testified under oath before a House Oversight subcommittee regarding a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval program. He claimed he had been denied access to this program.</p>
<p>On January 30, 2023, Eric Burlison discussed the Trump administration's involvement in facilitating access to restricted UFO-related sites during a podcast interview.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The White House has told the DoD to make it happen,” Burlison said, referring to the administration's support for his request.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Burlison further claimed that access to these sites could uncover “unusual aircraft, materials, non-human bodies or archived records” that would prove the existence of extraterrestrial beings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous claims regarding UFOs and extraterrestrial life have often been met with skepticism. The U.S. defense establishment has consistently stated it has found no verifiable evidence of alien technology. However, the topic has gained traction in political discussions, particularly with increasing public interest in transparency about government-held secrets.</p>
<p>In March 2025, Burlison announced that Grusch would join his office as a special advisor, further promoting the narrative of transparency regarding UAPs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congressman Burlison aims to gain access to restricted sites related to UFO programs. Further developments may hinge on the Department of Defense's response to his request and the outcomes of any proposed congressional visits.</p>
