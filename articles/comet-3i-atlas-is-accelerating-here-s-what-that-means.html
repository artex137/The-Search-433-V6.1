      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Accelerating. Here’s What That Means</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, is accelerating and approaching its closest point to Earth on December 19. Observations have revealed significant non-gravitational accelerations in all three components of the comet's motion, according to a new paper by scientists.</p>

<p>This acceleration is significant as it allows researchers to better understand the behavior of interstellar comets. NASA has stated there is no danger to Earth from 3I/ATLAS, as it will not come closer than 170 million miles from the planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
<li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</li>
<li>As of November 30, 3I/ATLAS was approximately 178 million miles from Earth.</li>
<li>3I/ATLAS was traveling at about 137,000 miles per hour when first detected, increasing to 153,000 miles per hour at its closest point to the Sun.</li>
<li>The comet has an icy nucleus and a coma, which emits gas and dust as it approaches the Sun.</li>
<li>NASA has confirmed there is no danger to Earth from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023 by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. It reached its closest point to the Sun at the end of October and reappeared on the other side of the Sun in early December. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Until recently, finding non-gravitational accelerations in comets required observations over multiple orbits—which we will never have for interstellar objects,” said Marshall Eubanks, paper author.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is no danger to Earth from this comet,” NASA stated, noting it will come no closer than 170 million miles to our planet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as an interstellar object due to its high velocity and trajectory. It follows a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it is moving too quickly to be bound by the Sun's gravity, and will not return after passing through the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior, providing updates to the public as necessary.</p>
