      <h2>NASA reveals detailed chemical composition of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with organic molecules</h2>

<p>NASA has announced the discovery of a detailed chemical composition of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The findings, released on February 9, 2026, highlight the presence of organic molecules in the comet, which was first observed in 2020. The analysis was conducted using data collected from various space telescopes and instruments.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances the understanding of the materials that exist in the universe and their potential origins. NASA scientists are currently analyzing the implications of these findings on theories of comet formation and the building blocks of life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: February 9, 2026</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS first observed: 2020</li>
    <li>Key agency: NASA</li>
    <li>Organic molecules detected: Yes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2020 as it approached the solar system. NASA's team has since monitored its trajectory and composition using advanced telescopes. On February 9, 2026, the agency released comprehensive findings regarding the comet's chemical makeup.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of organic molecules in 3I/ATLAS suggests that these materials are more prevalent in the universe than previously thought,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This discovery could have profound implications for our understanding of the origins of life.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery follows previous findings of organic compounds on other celestial bodies, which have sparked interest in astrobiology. The presence of such molecules in comets is crucial for understanding the chemical processes that may have contributed to the emergence of life on Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to conduct further analysis of 3I/ATLAS to explore the implications of its findings. Researchers will continue to monitor the comet and other similar celestial bodies to gather more data.</p>
