      <h2>NASA Unveils New Images of Interstellar Comet 31/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Nasa has released new images of interstellar comet 31/ATLAS, showcasing the most detailed view yet of the comet as it travels through the solar system. The agency confirmed on Wednesday, November 19, that 15 spacecraft, including the James Webb Space Telescope, have captured images and data of the comet.</p>

<p>This release marks a significant advancement in the study of interstellar objects. According to NASA, the observations provide crucial insights into the composition and characteristics of the comet, which is believed to have originated from outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA released images on November 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Fifteen spacecraft participated in the imaging campaign.</li>
    <li>Key spacecraft include the James Webb Space Telescope and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>The comet is designated 31/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>NASA has clarified that 31/ATLAS is a comet, not an alien vessel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has been monitoring comet 31/ATLAS since its discovery. The agency utilized various spacecraft to gather data as the comet approached the inner solar system. The new images were compiled and released during a press briefing on November 19, 2023.</p>

<p>NASA’s scientific instruments have been employed beyond their intended capabilities to capture these images, demonstrating the agency's commitment to exploring interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We’ve pushed our scientific instruments beyond what they were designed to achieve to capture this amazing glimpse of an interstellar traveler,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet. But this one came from outside the solar system, which makes it fascinating and scientifically very important,” stated NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar comets is rare, with 31/ATLAS being one of the few such objects observed. The study of these comets can enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system, as well as other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the data collected from the spacecraft. Further studies are expected to focus on the comet's composition and trajectory as it moves through the solar system.</p>
