      <h2>Newly discovered comet 3I/ATLAS offers rare interstellar insights</h2>

<p>BILLINGS, Mont. – A newly discovered comet, 3I/ATLAS, is passing through our solar system and is only the third interstellar comet ever found. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth in mid-December 2025, according to Dr. Mark Reiser, an astronomy professor from the University of Montana.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as scientists are particularly interested in the comet's icy makeup, which contains more carbon dioxide than most previously observed comets. Authorities, including astronomers and scientists, are studying 3I/ATLAS to learn about materials from outside our solar system, providing insights into the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> Mid-December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Third interstellar comet discovered</li>
    <li><strong>Key Feature:</strong> Contains more carbon dioxide than most comets</li>
    <li><strong>Orbit Type:</strong> Hyperbolic, indicating it will not return</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been identified as an interstellar object, meaning it did not form in our solar system. It follows a hyperbolic orbit, indicating that it is merely passing through and will not return. Scientists have noted its atypical icy composition, prompting further investigation into its origins.</p>

<p>Dr. Reiser has explained that the comet's unusual balance of ices suggests it formed under different conditions compared to typical comets found in our solar system. Observations indicate that the comet has shown some atypical behaviors, including an initial counter tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We probably treat that as a person or, you know, a critter, but we just mean a visitor as far as a rock, a comet, an icy body that was not made here,” said Dr. Mark Reiser.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The energy is such that it was actually too rapidly moving to ever have been bound to the sun on the path that it's coming in at,” Reiser added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I don't think we need to - to go outside those realms to explain what we're seeing,” Reiser stated, dismissing online speculation about the comet being artificial or alien.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar comets have been identified. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS provide an opportunity for scientists to study the conditions of other solar systems and the formation of comets.</p>

<p>The study of interstellar comets is crucial for understanding the diversity of celestial bodies and the processes that govern their formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, gathering data to further analyze its composition and origins. Observations will focus on its icy makeup and any additional atypical behaviors as it nears its closest approach.</p>
