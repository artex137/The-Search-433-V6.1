      <h2>A film about unidentified phenomena gets a congressional audience</h2>

<p>On Monday evening, a group of House members convened in the Cannon House Office Building to view a new documentary titled “The Age of Disclosure,” which discusses unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as UFOs. The screening, attended by five House members and several former officials, aimed to shed light on government disclosures regarding UAPs.</p>

<p>The documentary features testimonies from 34 former and current government and military officials. It claims there has been an 80-year cover-up concerning advanced nonhuman intelligence and reverse engineering of technology from unidentified crashes. The film debuted earlier this year at the South by Southwest festival and is now available in theaters and on Amazon Prime. The screening was partly organized to garner support for the UAP Disclosure Act, which seeks to increase transparency regarding UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Screening of the documentary “The Age of Disclosure”</li>
    <li>Date: Monday, November 20, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Cannon House Office Building, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Attendees: Five House members, former officials, and film producer Dan Farah</li>
    <li>Duration of film: 109 minutes</li>
    <li>Key participants in the film: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Rep. André Carson, Rep. Eric Burlison</li>
    <li>Legislation discussed: UAP Disclosure Act</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 20, 2025, members of Congress attended a private screening of “The Age of Disclosure.” The event was delayed due to a prior vote, leading to a late start at 7 p.m. The film features testimonies from senior officials who claim knowledge of UAPs and has sparked discussions about legislative action.</p>

<p>During the screening, Rep. André Carson praised the documentary, stating it connects various narratives surrounding UAPs. Rep. Eric Burlison expressed hope that the film would prioritize UAP issues within the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Prior to the screening, several congressional committees have held public hearings on UAPs, interviewing witnesses and government personnel over the past few years.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is a section in here that will bring context to all the fuzzy photos that we’ve seen.” - Rep. André Carson</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I think we’ve had enough hearings; it is now time for hard evidence or ‘receipts.’” - Rep. Eric Burlison</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The public has been kept in the dark, and misled by a sophisticated disinformation campaign.” - Dan Farah</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The screening comes after a 2021 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which reviewed over 100 UAP sightings and found no data explaining them as U.S. classified programs or extraterrestrial visitations. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has stated it lacks verifiable information regarding any government program related to reverse-engineering extraterrestrial materials.</p>

<p>Previous congressional hearings have featured testimonies from whistleblowers and military personnel regarding UAP sightings, contributing to ongoing discussions about transparency and national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the screening, attendees expressed support for the UAP Disclosure Act, which aims to enhance transparency in government disclosures about UAPs. Congressional representatives are expected to continue discussions and advocate for legislative measures to protect whistleblowers and encourage reporting of UAP incidents.</p>
