      <h2>A Film About Unidentified Phenomena Gets a Congressional Audience</h2>

<p>On November 20, 2025, a documentary titled “The Age of Disclosure” was screened for a bipartisan group of members of the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. The film features discussions by nearly three dozen government and military officials about unidentified aerial phenomena, commonly known as UFOs.</p>

<p>This screening marks a significant moment in the ongoing conversation about unidentified aerial phenomena. The documentary claims that there has been an 80-year cover-up regarding the reverse engineering of technology retrieved from crashes. It features prominent figures, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has previously served as vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>Members of Congress, including Representative André Carson, gathered in a closed-door session after a vote, arriving late for the event.</p>
<p>During the screening, discussions followed, allowing participants to reflect on the film's content and the implications of the information presented.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The film addresses long-standing public interest in UFOs and government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. This interest has grown amid recent disclosures and discussions in legislative circles about national security and aerial threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the screening, it remains unclear what formal actions or investigations may arise from the discussions and claims made in the film. Further engagement from Congress on the topic of unidentified aerial phenomena is anticipated.</p>
