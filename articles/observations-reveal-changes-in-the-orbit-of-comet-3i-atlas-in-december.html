      <h2>Observations reveal changes in the orbit of comet 3I/ATLAS in December</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, officially designated as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), has exhibited changes in its orbit during late December 2025. The comet, identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile, is currently moving away from the Sun and will remain visible in telescopes until early 2026.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances understanding of the behavior of interstellar comets. International observatories are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to refine orbital models and gather data on non-gravitational accelerations, which are common in comets due to the sublimation of ices. The changes pose no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was identified on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 30, 2025, at 1.36 astronomical units (AU).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth was on December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU.</li>
    <li>The comet's speed relative to the Sun is about 60 km/s.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate the comet has an icy core, coma, and tail.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be billions of years old.</li>
    <li>The comet is heading towards interstellar space, in the direction of the constellation of Gêmeos.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile. After its perihelion on October 30, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. In late December, astronomers observed variations in its trajectory, linked to non-gravitational accelerations due to gas and dust release from the comet.</p>

<p>International observatories have since begun monitoring the comet more closely to gather data and refine orbital models. The comet remains visible through telescopes until early 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These changes refine orbital models, but pose no threat to Terra,” said a spokesperson from the international observatory network monitoring 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Its composition includes elements such as carbon dioxide, nickel vapor, cyanide, and reddish dust, providing insights into the formation of planetary bodies in other star systems.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS contributes to a growing body of knowledge about interstellar comets and their dynamics, aided by missions like ExoMars and MAVEN.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS, focusing on its ionic tail and the potential influence of Jupiter's gravity on its trajectory. Data collected will enhance understanding of interstellar comet behavior.</p>
