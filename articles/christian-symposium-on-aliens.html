      <h2>Christian Symposium on Aliens Held in Roswell</h2>

<p>The First Christian Symposium on Aliens took place in July 2009 at the Clarion Inn & Suites in Roswell, New Mexico, gathering 11 evangelical Christian scholars and ministers to discuss UFOs and biblical perspectives on alien phenomena. No injuries or fatalities have been reported from the event.</p>

<p>This symposium is significant as it reflects a concerted effort by Christian thought leaders to address the intersection of faith and the growing interest in unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The event aimed to equip attendees with a cohesive understanding of the phenomenon, countering what organizers termed "deceptive influences" associated with UFOs and alien encounters.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2009, the First Christian Symposium on Aliens convened in Roswell, coinciding with the annual Roswell UFO Festival. The event featured a series of lectures and discussions aimed at providing a Christian perspective on UFOs and alien encounters.</p>
<p>Joseph G. Jordan, a Florida resident and ordained minister, served as a speaker, sharing his research and insights as a Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) state section director. Jordan, who has previously worked for NASA and currently works for Blue Origin, has discussed how individuals can seek spiritual guidance to overcome experiences of alien abduction.</p>
<p>The symposium concluded with a comprehensive survey of frequently asked questions regarding aliens, UFOs, and their relation to biblical teachings, which were answered by the panel of experts present.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The symposium’s mission was to assemble many of the most noted Christian authors and researchers in the field of alien research,” said Jordan. “Our goal was to equip The Body of Christ to not be deceived by these seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The First Christian Symposium on Aliens highlights a growing trend among religious scholars to engage with contemporary issues of faith and science. Historically, many Christians have viewed UFOs and alien encounters with skepticism, often attributing them to demonic influences. This event aimed to challenge those assumptions through research and dialogue.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future discussions and research initiatives are expected as interest in UFO phenomena continues to rise within both religious and secular communities. The insights gained from this symposium may influence ongoing conversations about spirituality and extraterrestrial life.</p>
