      <h2>The day UFOs hovered over Redmond — and the Air Force scrambled jets</h2>

<p>Redmond, Oregon, was the site of a reported UFO sighting on September 24, 1959, when a police officer and an FAA officer observed an unidentified object in the sky for nearly two hours. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the incident.</p>

<p>This sighting has garnered renewed interest as it highlights the early days of UFO reports during the Space Age. Local authorities, including the Redmond Police Department and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), have confirmed their involvement in the incident, which led to a response from the U.S. Air Force.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>Date of sighting: September 24, 1959</li>
    <li>Location: Redmond, Oregon</li>
    <li>Duration of observation: Approximately two hours</li>
    <li>Involved officials: Redmond Police Officer Robert Dickerson and FAA officer Laverne Wertz</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the morning of September 24, 1959, Redmond Police Officer Robert Dickerson and FAA officer Laverne Wertz reported seeing a UFO. The object reportedly came close to the ground and stopped, prompting Dickerson to pull over and observe it further.</p>

<p>Wertz communicated the sighting to the Seattle control center, which confirmed radar contact and prompted the Air Force to scramble six fighter jets. As the jets approached, the object reportedly changed shape from a saucer to a mushroom form and emitted flames before disappearing from sight.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday, another bright object appeared in the sky, leading to a gathering of local residents and officials at the airport. FAA official Boyd Wolfe identified the object as Venus, although some have questioned this explanation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It came close to the ground and it stopped. And at that time, I pulled over the side of the road and stopped the car and watched it.” — Redmond Police Officer Robert Dickerson</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Laverne Wertz from the airport actually reports the sighting to the Seattle control center. Well, they're looking at the radar and communicating with the Air Force and there's actually something on a radar signal.” — Kelly Cannon Miller, Executive Director, Deschutes Historical Museum</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 1950s marked a significant period for UFO sightings in the United States, coinciding with the onset of the Space Age. Reports of unidentified flying objects have often sparked public interest and speculation about extraterrestrial life. The involvement of credible witnesses, such as police officers and FAA officials, adds a layer of legitimacy to these accounts.</p>

<p>Over the years, many UFO sightings have been dismissed or explained away, but incidents like the one in Redmond continue to fuel debate and intrigue regarding the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any ongoing investigations related to this historical sighting. The lack of conclusive evidence and the passage of time have limited further inquiries into the incident.</p>
