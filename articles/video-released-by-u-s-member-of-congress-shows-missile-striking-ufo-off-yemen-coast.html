      <h2>Video released by U.S. member of Congress shows missile striking UFO off Yemen Coast</h2>

<p>A video released on September 10, 2025, by U.S. Representative Eric Burlison appears to show a U.S. military Hellfire missile striking an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. No injuries or fatalities have been reported. The footage was revealed during a House Government Oversight subcommittee hearing focused on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP).</p>

<p>This video raises significant questions regarding the nature of the object and its implications for U.S. naval operations. During the hearing, Burlison presented the video, claiming it was captured by an MQ-9 Reaper drone. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) continues to investigate military UAP reports, with many cases yet to be explained.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video released on September 10, 2025</li>
    <li>Incident recorded on October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Object tracked by an MQ-9 Reaper drone</li>
    <li>U.S. Navy active in the area due to threats from Houthi militants</li>
    <li>Investigation ongoing by AARO</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a U.S. military drone tracked an unidentified object over the waters off Yemen. During this time, U.S. Navy vessels were present in the area to protect commercial shipping lanes from missile and drone threats posed by Houthi militants. The footage was later presented by Burlison during a congressional hearing on UAPs on September 10, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’m not going to explain it to you; you’ll see exactly what it does,” said Representative Eric Burlison as the video played.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That’s the Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bouncing right off,” commented investigative journalist George Knapp.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We do not have anything to provide on this,” stated a U.S. defense official regarding the authenticity of the video.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident echoes previous UAP reports, including the “Go Fast” video from 2015, which was later attributed to an optical illusion involving a weather balloon. As technology has improved, newer incidents like this have provided more data for analysis, although the AARO has yet to confirm any extraterrestrial origins for such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO will continue its investigation into this incident and other military UAP reports, with updates expected as more information becomes available.</p>
