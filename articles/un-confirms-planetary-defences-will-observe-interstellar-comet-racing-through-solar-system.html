      <h2>UN confirms planetary defences will observe interstellar comet racing through Solar System</h2>

<p>The United Nations has confirmed that a team of scientists from the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) will observe the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System, starting from November 27, 2025. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, poses no threat to Earth, according to the UN.</p>

<p>This initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance global readiness against Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). The UN stated that the observation of comet 3I/ATLAS provides a valuable opportunity for the IAWN community to conduct an observing exercise due to the comet's prolonged visibility from Earth and its interest to the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Start Date:</strong> November 27, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Duration:</strong> Two months</li>
    <li><strong>Organising Body:</strong> International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN)</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Campaigns:</strong> Eighth observing exercise since 2017</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. The UN has announced the commencement of the observation campaign, which will begin on November 27, 2025, and last for two months.</p>

<p>Experts have indicated that the comet may have a close encounter with Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. This has raised concerns about a potential "course-altering" collision, although the comet poses no direct threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While it poses no threat, comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and high interest to the scientific community,” the UN stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“IAWN had been planning to do a Fall 2025 comet campaign since 2024 to exercise capabilities for measuring the position of comets, which pose additional astrometric challenges as they appear as fuzzy extended objects compared to point-like asteroids in a telescope's field of view,” the UN added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to pass through our Solar System. Previous campaigns by IAWN have focused on monitoring asteroids and comets to better prepare for potential impacts and enhance global planetary defense capabilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will proceed with its planned observation campaign for comet 3I/ATLAS, allowing scientists to gather valuable data and enhance their understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
