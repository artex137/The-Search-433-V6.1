      <h2>The mysterious interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is about to make its close approach to Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, 19 December 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometres. The comet, discovered on 1 July 2025, has generated excitement as it travels through our Solar System.</p>

<p>This close approach marks a significant milestone for astronomers and enthusiasts alike. While the comet will not come close enough to be classified as a near-Earth object, its visibility offers an opportunity for both professional and amateur astronomers to observe and document its passage.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> Friday, 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 270 million km (170 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Telescopes Used:</strong> Gemini South, Very Large Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope</li>
    <li><strong>Live-streaming:</strong> Available through the Virtual Telescope Project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025. It quickly captured attention as an interstellar visitor, having formed beyond our Solar System. The comet disappeared behind the Sun in autumn 2025 before re-emerging in the winter morning sky.</p>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has been photographed by various telescopes and spacecraft, including those observing solar activity and missions on their way to Mars and Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This cometary milestone is sure to be recorded and captured by professional astronomers using humanity's best telescopes," said a spokesperson from NASA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The excitement surrounding 3I/ATLAS has included claims of it being an alien spacecraft, which the majority of professional astronomers have refuted. The comet has provided a unique opportunity for public engagement in astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches Earth, astronomers are preparing to document its passage. Amateur astronomers are encouraged to observe the comet and share their images, which may be featured in upcoming publications.</p>
