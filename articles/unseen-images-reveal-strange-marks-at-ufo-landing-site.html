      <h2>Unseen images reveal strange marks at 'UFO' landing site</h2>

<p>Unseen images from Brazil have shown a site where an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) might have landed, featuring strange marks and burnt grass. The incident reportedly occurred on 01 October 1995 on Ilha do Major in São Paulo, Brazil, when fishermen Fernando Beserra and Wilson da Silva Oliveira claimed to have witnessed a disc-shaped UFO emitting a bright yellow hue.</p>

<p>This sighting has drawn attention due to the unusual evidence and the ongoing interest in UFO phenomena. Authorities and researchers are examining the site and the implications of the findings, which include unusual soil properties and the absence of conventional aircraft in the area at the time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: 01 October 1995</li>
    <li>Location: Ilha do Major, São Paulo, Brazil</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Fernando Beserra and Wilson da Silva Oliveira</li>
    <li>Weight of each landing gear: 25 kilos</li>
    <li>Soil samples tested: Germination rates varied within and outside the burnt area</li>
    <li>Military confirmation: Santos Military Air Base had no aircraft in the area at the time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 01 October 1995, Fernando Beserra and Wilson da Silva Oliveira were gathering their nets on Ilha do Major when they observed a disc-shaped UFO overhead. Initially mistaking it for a balloon, they soon realized it was an alien spacecraft as it approached rapidly. Terrified by the intense light, they fled in their boat as the object landed nearby.</p>

<p>Following the incident, researchers analyzed the landing site, discovering strange marks in the soil and burnt grass. Tests on soil samples indicated that seeds planted within the burnt area germinated easily, while those planted outside suffered from fungal attacks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The marks were not from conventional helicopters or aircraft,” investigators stated, highlighting the uniqueness of the findings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Santos Military Air Base confirmed that it had no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting,” officials reported.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader pattern of UFO sightings that have intrigued both the public and researchers for decades. While many sightings have been dismissed as misidentified aircraft or natural phenomena, cases like this one continue to fuel speculation and investigation.</p>

<p>The scientific community remains divided on the implications of such findings, particularly regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigators will continue to analyze the site and further study the soil samples. Future research may provide additional insights into the nature of the marks and the events surrounding the sighting.</p>
