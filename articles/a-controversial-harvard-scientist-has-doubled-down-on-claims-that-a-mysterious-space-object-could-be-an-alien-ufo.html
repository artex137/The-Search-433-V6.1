      <h2>A Controversial Harvard Scientist Has Doubled-Down On Claims That A Mysterious Space Object Could Be An Alien UFO</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has reiterated his claims that a mysterious space object, designated "3I/ATLAS," could be an alien probe as it approaches the Solar System. The object is scheduled for a high-speed flyby of Jupiter, Venus, and Mars later this year.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as scientists prepare to study 3I/ATLAS, which some experts believe is a comet. Loeb has suggested that the object's unusual glow might indicate a power source, possibly a nuclear reactor. His claims have sparked debate within the scientific community regarding the nature of the object and the implications of potential extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Upcoming flyby:</strong> Scheduled for later this year</li>
    <li><strong>Proposed power source:</strong> Possible nuclear reactor</li>
    <li><strong>Related figure:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li><strong>Involvement:</strong> Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna in contact with Loeb</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers discovered the object now known as 3I/ATLAS. As it approaches the Solar System, scientists have prepared to observe its trajectory and characteristics. Loeb has publicly speculated about the object's nature and its potential as an alien artifact.</p>

<p>Loeb gained notoriety in 2017 for his theory regarding a previous unidentified object, Oumuamua, which he suggested could have been alien technology. His latest claims regarding 3I/ATLAS have reignited discussions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By far the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet.”</blockquote> 
<blockquote>“The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is notably weird: when it nears our big blue marble, it will duck behind the Sun so we can't make any close observations.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's views have attracted both support and skepticism. Some scientists criticize his approach for potentially undermining serious research into extraterrestrial phenomena. Meanwhile, an investigative series by the Wall Street Journal has suggested that the mythology surrounding UFOs, particularly related to Area 51, may have been a government distraction.</p>

<p>Loeb's perspective has found traction among some in the UFO community who prefer to explore scientific possibilities rather than dismiss them outright. His focus on ancient structures and long-distance space travel introduces a different angle to the ongoing debate about unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its flyby, scientists anticipate gathering data to help determine the object's true nature. Congresswoman Luna's discussions with Loeb may lead to the repurposing of probes to study the object during its close approach to Jupiter and Mars.</p>
