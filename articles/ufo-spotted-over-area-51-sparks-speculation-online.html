<p>This sighting matters as it has reignited interest in Area 51, a facility long associated with secretive military testing. Authorities have not provided any official explanations regarding the nature of the object, leaving speculation to circulate online.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Area 51, Nevada</li>
    <li>Object: Triangular-shaped UFO</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Reports indicate that the triangular UFO was observed recently over Area 51. The footage of the object was circulated widely on social media, though the specific date of the sighting has not been disclosed. The base has been a focal point for speculation about advanced military technology for decades.</p>

<p>Unofficial reports suggest that test flights of a sixth-generation aircraft under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program may have begun as early as 2020. Additionally, claims have surfaced regarding the presence of a classified unmanned aerial vehicle at the facility.</p>
