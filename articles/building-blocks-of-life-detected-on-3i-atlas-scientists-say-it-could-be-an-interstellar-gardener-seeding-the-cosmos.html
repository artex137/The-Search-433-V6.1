      <h2>Building blocks of life detected on 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A NASA spacecraft has discovered organic chemicals on comet 3I/ATLAS, leading scientists to speculate that it could be an interstellar “gardener” spreading life across the universe. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb presented this theory following findings from NASA’s SPHEREx spacecraft, which scanned the comet in December and detected molecules such as methanol, cyanide, and methane — potential precursors to life on Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of life in the cosmos. Researchers are now examining the gas surrounding ATLAS for further signs of life. The findings highlight the potential for comets to carry the building blocks of life across vast distances in space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery made by NASA’s SPHEREx spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Organic molecules detected include methanol, cyanide, and methane.</li>
    <li>Observations took place in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached a brightness peak after passing near the Sun.</li>
    <li>Study led by Carey Lisse at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, NASA’s SPHEREx spacecraft observed comet 3I/ATLAS and detected organic molecules, including methane. Following these observations, scientists, including Avi Loeb, began discussing the implications of the findings, suggesting that ATLAS could potentially harbor life or be spreading it across the universe.</p>

<p>Loeb proposed a hypothetical mission where an interceptor spacecraft could collide with ATLAS, depositing terrestrial life seeds into the comet. This idea emphasizes the potential for comets to act as vessels for life across different solar systems.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Is it possible that there are microbes or some forms of life on 3I/ATLAS?” Loeb asked. “If such a rock had microbes in it, they would’ve survived.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are now seeing the usual range of early Solar System materials, including organic molecules, soot and rock dust, that are typically emitted by a comet,” said Carey Lisse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The methane is being produced by something that is thriving, especially when it’s illuminated by sunlight like life that came to life suddenly,” Loeb posited.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery aligns with ongoing research into the role of comets in the origins of life on Earth. Previous studies have suggested that comets may have delivered essential organic compounds to our planet. Loeb’s theory builds on these ideas, proposing that comets could actively distribute life throughout the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue analyzing the gas surrounding 3I/ATLAS for additional signs of life. Loeb also suggests further exploration into the comet’s potential as a carrier of terrestrial life, although no specific missions are currently planned.</p>
