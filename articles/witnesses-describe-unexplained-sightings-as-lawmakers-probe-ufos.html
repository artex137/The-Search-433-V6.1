      <h2>Witnesses describe unexplained sightings as lawmakers probe UFOs</h2>

<p>Congress has held a hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) on Tuesday, where lawmakers, whistleblowers, and defense officials discussed unexplained sightings and the issue of limited transparency. Four witnesses testified under oath about their encounters with UAPs, raising concerns about military transparency regarding these sightings.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it highlights national security, government accountability, and the public's right to information about UAPs. The House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, chaired by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, aims to investigate these phenomena further, emphasizing that this inquiry is not based on science fiction but on factual concerns.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: Tuesday</li>
    <li>Location: U.S. Congress</li>
    <li>Number of witnesses: Four</li>
    <li>Notable video shown: Drone footage from Oct. 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Witness testimony: Included accounts of UAP encounters and concerns over military transparency</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, Congress convened to discuss UAPs. During the hearing, lawmakers reviewed drone footage captured on October 30, 2024, showing a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen that was struck by a missile. Witnesses provided personal accounts of their UAP encounters, expressing fears of retaliation for their disclosures.</p>
<p>Rep. Eric Burlison introduced the video and discussed the challenges faced in pursuing government transparency regarding UAPs. Witnesses, including journalist George Knapp and Air Force veteran Dylan Borland, shared their experiences and concerns about government knowledge of these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These are not isolated instances, so it gives us reasoning to provide investigative inquiry into these topics,” said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That’s a hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bouncing right off… what the hell is that?” stated George Knapp, referring to the drone footage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Congressional staff have blocked previous efforts pushing for government disclosure,” said Rep. Eric Burlison, promising to push past the red tape for accountability.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The cultural phenomenon of UFO sightings dates back to the 1940s and 1950s, when reports of “flying saucers” gained public attention. These sightings were often reflected in Hollywood films and comic books, which portrayed both wonder and fear. The Library of Congress noted that these representations mirrored broader societal anxieties, including fears related to atomic bombs and Cold War tensions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The House Task Force plans to continue investigating UAPs and push for greater government transparency. Lawmakers will seek to address the concerns raised during the hearing and ensure that the public is informed about what is happening in U.S. airspace.</p>
