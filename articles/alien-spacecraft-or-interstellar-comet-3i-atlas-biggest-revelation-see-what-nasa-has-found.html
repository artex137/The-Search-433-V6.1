      <h2>Alien Spacecraft or Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Biggest Revelation: See what NASA has found</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, contains significant amounts of carbon dioxide and water ice. This finding marks an important milestone in the study of interstellar objects, as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system.</p>

<p>The detection of carbon dioxide fog and water ice in 3I/ATLAS provides valuable insights into the composition of interstellar comets. Researchers are now comparing this comet's structure to those formed within our solar neighborhood. The study aims to enhance the understanding of how comets evolve across different star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>Only the third interstellar object observed entering the solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA’s SPHEREx telescope detected carbon dioxide and water ice.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Expected to release more gases and dust as it approaches the sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile identified comet 3I/ATLAS. This discovery has allowed scientists to study its unique characteristics as it is not bound by the sun's gravity, indicating its interstellar origin.</p>
<p>NASA’s SPHEREx telescope has since analyzed the comet, revealing the presence of carbon dioxide in its coma and water ice in its nucleus. This suggests that 3I/ATLAS has a composition similar to solar system comets.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to reach perihelion in late October 2025, where it will be closely monitored as it approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of carbon dioxide gas shows that it behaved like a typical solar system comet,” said astronomer Carey Lisse from Johns Hopkins University. “The balance of water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide depends on where and when comets are formed.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant because it provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar comet. Previous interstellar objects have been less accessible for detailed analysis. Understanding its composition helps scientists compare it with local comets, shedding light on the formation and evolution of comets across different star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa and international observatories will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun. The findings from this research will be published in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society, with a detailed paper to follow soon.</p>
