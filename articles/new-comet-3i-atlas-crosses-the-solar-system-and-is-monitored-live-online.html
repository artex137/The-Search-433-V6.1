      <h2>New comet 3I/ATLAS crosses the Solar System and is monitored live online</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025, is currently crossing the Solar System at speeds exceeding 210,000 km/h. The comet passed its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, and has since become visible again in the night sky. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third object of interstellar origin detected in our cosmic region. Authorities have made real-time tracking available online, allowing both amateur and professional astronomers to observe its trajectory. Digital platforms provide free tools to the public for tracking the comet, enhancing public engagement with astronomy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 210,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet passed its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2025. Following this event, it became visible again in the sky, prompting increased interest from both amateur and professional astronomers.</p>

<p>As the comet continues its journey through the Solar System, digital platforms have made it possible to track its position and trajectory in real time. Observers can access various tools and simulations online to enhance their viewing experience.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The visibility of 3I/ATLAS has attracted a wide audience, providing opportunities for education and engagement in astronomy,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS marks the third interstellar object detected in our vicinity, highlighting the growing interest and advancements in astronomical observation. Digital tracking tools have democratized access to astronomy, allowing more people to engage with celestial events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, observers can look forward to ongoing updates from tracking platforms, which will provide real-time data on its position and trajectory.</p>
