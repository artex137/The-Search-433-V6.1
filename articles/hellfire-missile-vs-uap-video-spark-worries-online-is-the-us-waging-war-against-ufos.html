      <h2>Hellfire Missile Vs. UAP Video Spark Worries Online — Is the US Waging War Against UFOs?</h2>

<p>A 50-second declassified video showing a Hellfire missile striking an unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) has sparked intense debate following its release during a congressional hearing on 30 October 2024. The footage, recorded off Yemen's coast, features MQ-9 Reaper drones tracking and engaging what lawmakers have described as a UAP. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The video has raised significant concerns about the potential for US aerial combat with unidentified objects. Lawmakers are pressing for transparency regarding UAP incidents and the implications of military engagement with such phenomena. Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri presented the footage during the hearing and later shared it on social media, leading to widespread discussion and speculation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of video recording: 30 October 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off Yemen's coast</li>
    <li>Footage presented by: Congressman Eric Burlison</li>
    <li>Type of missile used: AGM-114 Hellfire</li>
    <li>Drone model involved: MQ-9 Reaper</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 30 October 2024, a declassified video was recorded off Yemen's coast, showing a Hellfire missile strike on an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The footage was presented during a congressional hearing by Congressman Eric Burlison, who stated the material was sourced from a whistleblower. Following the hearing, Burlison shared the video on social media, which quickly gained traction online.</p>

<p>In the days following the release, speculation grew regarding the nature of the object targeted by the missile. Analysts offered differing opinions, with some suggesting it resembled a balloon, while others indicated it could be a subsonic cruise missile or a kamikaze drone.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Congressman Eric Burlison:</strong> "I'm not going to speculate what it is, but the question is why are we being blocked from this information?"
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Florida Congressman Jared Moskowitz:</strong> "We are definitely being lied to, there's just no doubt about that."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Pentagon official:</strong> "We do not have anything to provide on this."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident comes amid ongoing US military operations in the region, where US forces have been intercepting Houthi drones and missiles since late 2023. The use of MQ-9 Reapers in an air-to-air role is notable, as they are traditionally employed for surveillance and ground strikes. Previous instances of drones engaging airborne targets have occurred, but this appears to be one of the first public examples of Reapers launching Hellfires in a live aerial engagement.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, investigations into the nature of the object and the implications of the engagement are ongoing. Lawmakers continue to call for transparency regarding UAP incidents, while the Pentagon has not confirmed whether the object was indeed a UAP or a conventional threat. Further discussions and inquiries are expected in the coming weeks as authorities seek clarity on the matter.</p>
