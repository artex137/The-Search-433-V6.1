      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Avi Loeb Claims Michio Kaku 'Trying To Be Liked,' Wrote 'No Scientific Papers'</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has sparked controversy regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, claiming that physicist Michio Kaku lacks scientific credibility and is prioritizing popularity over scientific rigor. The debate has intensified as both scientists have publicly criticized each other's views on the nature of the object, which has drawn significant attention since its discovery.</p>

<p>This dispute matters because it highlights differing perspectives within the scientific community about the interpretation of data regarding 3I/ATLAS. Loeb argues that the object could potentially be an alien probe, while Kaku maintains a more cautious stance, suggesting that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The ongoing controversy raises questions about how scientific debates should be conducted and the role of public figures in communicating science.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object currently under scientific scrutiny.</li>
  <li>Avi Loeb claims Michio Kaku has not authored any scientific papers on the topic.</li>
  <li>Loeb emphasizes the importance of data in understanding 3I/ATLAS.</li>
  <li>NASA has not yet released data requested by Loeb, citing bureaucratic reasons.</li>
  <li>The object has been observed moving at 60 kilometers per second.</li>
  <li>Loeb argues that the object's origins may be misinterpreted due to assumptions about its velocity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, a series of public exchanges between Avi Loeb and Michio Kaku have unfolded:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loeb first speculated about the object being an alien probe, drawing on his previous work with 'Oumuamua.</li>
  <li>Kaku responded by asserting that there is no evidence of alien technology associated with 3I/ATLAS.</li>
  <li>Loeb countered Kaku's remarks by questioning his scientific contributions to the discussion.</li>
  <li>Loeb has publicly criticized NASA for not releasing crucial data about the object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Well, again, he didn't write a single scientific paper on this subject. He's also a commentator and he's again trying to be liked and popularize science."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb further explained, "It's not as if he's saying that based on any calculation." He also emphasized the significance of the data he has analyzed regarding 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb expressed frustration with NASA, saying, "Oh yeah they haven't released it and I don't believe that they're doing it on purpose. I think it's just some bureaucratic rule that they have not to release it until the government shutdown ends."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate around 3I/ATLAS reflects a broader tension in the scientific community regarding the balance between speculation and empirical evidence. Previous discussions surrounding 'Oumuamua have similarly divided experts, with some advocating for cautious interpretation of unusual astronomical phenomena while others push for more radical hypotheses.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the debate continues, scientists await the release of NASA's high-resolution data on 3I/ATLAS, which could provide further insights into its nature and origins. The ongoing discussions may shape future research priorities and public interest in interstellar objects.</p>
