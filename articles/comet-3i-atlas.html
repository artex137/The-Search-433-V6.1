      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Solar System</h2>

<p>NASA has reported the discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, as it passes through our solar system. The comet was first observed on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study an object originating from outside our solar system. Authorities, including NASA and various observatories worldwide, are currently monitoring the comet's trajectory and physical properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles or 270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units (about 130 million miles or 210 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Visible Through:</strong> September 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Reappearance:</strong> Early December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Size Estimate:</strong> Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first reported on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope. Observations made before this date were collected from various ATLAS telescopes and Caltech’s Zwicky Transient Facility, dating back to June 14, 2025. The comet's trajectory has been confirmed as hyperbolic, indicating its interstellar origin.</p>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of 3I/ATLAS on July 21, 2025, when the comet was approximately 277 million miles from Earth. This observation revealed a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust around the comet's icy nucleus. Ongoing observations are aimed at refining size estimates and understanding the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS presents a remarkable opportunity to study an object from outside our solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Its hyperbolic trajectory confirms its interstellar nature.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following previous discoveries that have sparked interest in celestial objects originating from beyond our solar system. The study of such comets helps scientists learn more about the formation of planetary systems and the materials present in interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and various observatories will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and Earth. Further observations are scheduled, and scientists expect to gather more data on the comet's physical properties and trajectory.</p>
