      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is passing through the Solar System and is expected to reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. This unique comet is not expected to cause any injuries or fatalities as it poses no threat to the planet.</p>

<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS offers a rare opportunity for astronomers to study primordial material from outside the Solar System. Authorities and ground-based observatories are currently focusing efforts on observing the comet as it approaches perihelion, which occurred in late October 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object formed around another star system.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at an estimated distance of -1.8 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, occurred in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet may reach a magnitude of approximately 13, making it invisible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>Observations are targeted by ground-based observatories and space telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been traveling through the Solar System and is currently en route to its closest approach. Its perihelion occurred in late October 2025. As it gets closer to Earth, astronomers are actively monitoring its activity and composition.</p>
<p>Initial spectroscopic analyses have indicated that the comet's nucleus is rich in volatile ices, which will help astronomers understand its composition and the evolution of comets in other star systems.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a unique opportunity to study chemistry that predates the Solar System’s evolution,” said an astronomer involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Unlike periodic comets that return every few centuries, 3I/ATLAS follows a hyperbolic trajectory and will only pass by Earth once. This singular event allows for a rare glimpse of material that has traveled across interstellar space.</p>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into the building blocks of life and the formation of planets in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to collect photometric and spectroscopic observations of 3I/ATLAS until it fades from view after its closest approach. This period represents the last strong opportunity to gather data from this rare celestial visitor.</p>
