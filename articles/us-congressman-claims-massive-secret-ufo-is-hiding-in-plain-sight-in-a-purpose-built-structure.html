      <h2>US Congressman Claims Massive, Secret UFO Is Hiding in Plain Sight in a Purpose-Built Structure</h2>

<p>United States Congressman <strong>Eric Burlison</strong> of Missouri has claimed that a massive, secret UFO is concealed within a purpose-built structure at an undisclosed overseas location. Burlison stated that guards protect the site “like it’s some kind of commodity.” He asserted that the UFO is so large it could not be moved, necessitating the construction of an entire building around it.</p>

<p>This claim has drawn attention from both the public and experts in the field. Authorities are yet to confirm the existence of such a facility. Burlison has refrained from disclosing the specific country where the structure is located, citing concerns over classification levels. He has also made past comments regarding alien-human hybrids, further igniting discussion about the topic.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Congressman Eric Burlison claims a massive UFO is housed in a secret facility.</li>
    <li>The location of the facility remains undisclosed, although it is said to be overseas.</li>
    <li>Burlison stated that guards protect the site.</li>
    <li>He has previously made claims regarding alien-human hybrids.</li>
    <li>Social media users have speculated about a potential location in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province.</li>
    <li>A South Korean UFO researcher has disputed these claims, linking the facility to the 1970s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2025, Congressman Burlison publicly stated his belief that the Smithsonian is hiding evidence of giant humans that once roamed Earth. He also suggested the existence of four types of aliens: Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians.</p>

<p>In September 2025, Burlison shared a video during a Congressional hearing that appeared to show a Hellfire missile bouncing off an orb-shaped UFO. This hearing focused on UFO transparency and whistleblower protection.</p>

<p>Prior to this, Rep. <strong>Anna Paulina Luna</strong> of Florida commented on the federal government's history of withholding information from the public, referencing various historical events.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If I come under any hard evidence, whether it’s physical or video evidence that is absolutely definitive, I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe,” Burlison said during an interview.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Congressman Burlison's claims are part of a broader discussion on UFOs and government transparency, which has gained traction in recent years. The debate has involved various theories, investigations, and reports, with some officials calling for more openness regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>In the past, numerous conspiracy theories have emerged about government cover-ups related to UFOs and aliens, contributing to ongoing public interest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims made by Congressman Burlison are not currently underway, and it remains unclear if any official inquiries will be initiated. The discussion around UFOs and related phenomena is expected to continue in both public and political arenas.</p>
