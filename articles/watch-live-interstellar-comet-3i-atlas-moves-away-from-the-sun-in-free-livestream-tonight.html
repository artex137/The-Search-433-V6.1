      <h2>WATCH LIVE: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS moves away from the Sun in free livestream tonight</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has re-emerged from behind the Sun and will be visible in a livestream starting at 5:15 a.m. CET (11:15 p.m. ET) tonight from Manciano, Italy. This comet is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, and astronomers have closely followed its trajectory over the past few weeks.</p>

<p>The livestream, hosted by the Virtual Telescope Project, offers a rare opportunity for the public to observe the comet as it moves through the stars of Virgo. Scientists have been analyzing whether 3I/ATLAS has survived its close solar approach, which has sparked excitement and speculation in the scientific community and among the general public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Comet 3I/ATLAS livestream</li>
    <li>Date: Tonight</li>
    <li>Start Time: 5:15 a.m. CET (11:15 p.m. ET)</li>
    <li>Location: Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li>Magnitude: +10.9</li>
    <li>Livestream Source: Virtual Telescope Project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS entered our solar system four months ago, confirming its interstellar origin shortly after its discovery. It recently made a close approach to the Sun, prompting extensive observation and analysis by astronomers.</p>
<p>Recent images suggest that the comet has remained intact following its solar flyby, which has led to renewed discussions about its origins and stability.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, stated that the unusual stability of the comet could merit consideration of non-natural explanations. Other experts have expressed skepticism, attributing its condition to standard cometary physics.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet's journey has generated significant interest, particularly due to its path near Jupiter, Venus, and Mars, which has fueled discussions on social media. NASA is expected to release high-resolution images of the comet soon, captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the livestream provides an opportunity for public observation, NASA's upcoming release of high-resolution images will likely further inform discussions about 3I/ATLAS and its origins.</p>
