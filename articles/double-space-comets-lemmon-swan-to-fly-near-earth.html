      <h2>Double space comets Lemmon, Swan to fly near Earth</h2>

<p>Two comets, C/2025 A4, nicknamed "Lemmon," and C/2025 R2, known as "Swan," are set to fly near Earth this week, with Swan making its closest approach on Monday, October 23, and Lemmon following on Tuesday, October 24. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to these celestial events.</p>

<p>This rare encounter marks the first opportunity for stargazers to witness easily visible comets in nearly a year. Astronomers have organized live streams for spectators to observe the comets as they approach Earth. "So far, living in the Northern hemisphere, I could admire C/2025 A6 Lemmon only, but C/2025 R2 Swan is quickly joining the show and we are ready to amaze every astronomy lover with our live feed!" said astronomer Gianluca Masi.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Swan will pass approximately 24 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>Comet Lemmon will pass roughly 56 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>Comet Swan was discovered in September 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet Lemmon was discovered in January 2025.</li>
    <li>Best viewing time for both comets is about an hour and a half after sunset.</li>
    <li>Peak brightness for both comets is expected from October 23 to October 24.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In January 2025, astronomers discovered comet Lemmon. In September 2025, comet Swan was identified. Both comets will reach their closest points to Earth on October 23 and October 24, 2025, respectively.</p>

<p>Live streams of the comets' fly-bys will be available for spectators throughout the week, allowing astronomy enthusiasts to view the comets in real-time.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event follows nearly a year without easily visible comets, highlighting the significance of the upcoming encounters for stargazers. Comet Swan, which orbits the sun every 20,000 years, presents a rare opportunity for observation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers are encouraged to take advantage of the clear skies during the evenings this week to witness both comets as they make their closest approaches to Earth.</p>
