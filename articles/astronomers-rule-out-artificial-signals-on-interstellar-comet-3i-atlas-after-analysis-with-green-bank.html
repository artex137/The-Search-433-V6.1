      <h2>Astronomers rule out artificial signals on interstellar comet 3I/Atlas after analysis with Green Bank</h2>

<p>Astronomers from the Breakthrough Listen project have ruled out artificial radio signals from the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas following observations made at the Green Bank Telescope in December 2025. The analysis confirmed that the comet, which had its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometres, has a natural origin without any detectable artificial emissions.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it alleviates concerns about the comet potentially being an artificial object, similar to speculations raised regarding previous interstellar visitors. The study's results enhance the understanding of interstellar objects and the processes that govern their formation and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Observations of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Telescope used: Green Bank Telescope, 100 meters in diameter</li>
    <li>Maximum detectable power of signals: 0.1 watt</li>
    <li>Comet identified on: July 1, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS system. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its interstellar origin. The comet approached the Sun in October 2025, reaching a distance of approximately 1.4 astronomical units. Observations began in December 2025 during its closest approach to Earth.</p>
<p>The Green Bank Telescope operated in the 1 to 12 GHz band, searching for narrowband signals that could indicate artificial sources. No such signals were detected, leading to the conclusion that the comet is entirely natural.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The absence of artificial emissions reinforces our understanding of interstellar objects and their natural origins,” said a representative from the Breakthrough Listen project.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the Solar System, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each discovery has contributed to a growing body of knowledge about materials from other planetary systems. The increasing frequency of such detections is expected as new telescopes, like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, come into full operation in the coming years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its trajectory into deep interstellar space, researchers will continue to analyze data from multiple instruments to gain further insights into its characteristics and the dynamics of similar objects.</p>
