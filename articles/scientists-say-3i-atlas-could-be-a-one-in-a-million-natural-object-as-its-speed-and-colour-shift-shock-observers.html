      <h2>Scientists say 3i/Atlas could be a ‘one in a million’ natural object as its speed and colour shift shock observers</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3i/Atlas, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, has perplexed astronomers with its unusual behaviour, including sudden bursts of speed and a dramatic change in colour. The scientific community is now considering it a “one in a million” find, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</p>

<p>Loeb has estimated that 3i/Atlas may have a mass exceeding 50 billion tons, significantly larger than the previous interstellar comet, 1I/ʻOumuamua. As telescopes gather more data, scientists are investigating the object’s unique characteristics, which include an anti-tail jetting toward the Sun and an unexpected radio signal detected from the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Detected in the vicinity of the Sun</li>
    <li>Mass estimation: Over 50 billion tons</li>
    <li>First radio signal detected: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 269 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated size: At least 10 kilometers wide</li>
    <li>Jets releasing material: 50 billion tons per month</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3i/Atlas was first identified in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope. Astronomers observed its complex behaviour, including multiple jets, in November 2025. On October 24, 2025, a South African observatory detected the first radio signal from the comet, adding to the intrigue surrounding its nature. NASA confirmed that the comet is exhibiting non-gravitational acceleration, indicating that forces other than the Sun’s gravity are influencing its motion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Is the network of jets associated with pockets of ice on the surface of a natural nucleus, or are they coming from a set of jet thrusters used for navigation of a spacecraft?” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The acceleration results from internal engines.” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3i/Atlas is the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Loeb's analysis suggests the odds of an object like 3i/Atlas naturally forming are one in a hundred million. Its retrograde orbit and alignment with the ecliptic plane are statistically improbable for random interstellar debris.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA have ruled out any threat to Earth from 3i/Atlas. Telescopes worldwide, including Hubble and Webb, are set to conduct spectroscopic observations to analyze the comet’s jets for potential natural gases or other materials. Further studies will continue to reveal insights into this extraordinary cosmic entity.</p>
