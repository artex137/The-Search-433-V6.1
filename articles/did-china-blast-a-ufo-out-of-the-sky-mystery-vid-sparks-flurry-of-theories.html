      <h2>China Allegedly Strikes UFO in the Sky, Sparking Theories</h2>

<p>Footage has emerged of an alleged unidentified flying object (UFO) being struck in the sky over eastern China on Friday, drawing attention and speculation online. Locals in Weifang, Rizhao, and Shandong Province reported seeing a cluster of lights before the object disappeared in a flash. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The incident has raised questions about China's capabilities in planetary defense. Authorities have stated they have not received any information regarding an interception. This comes amid reports of China's plans to launch a mission to strike an asteroid, potentially making it the second country to achieve such a feat after the United States.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on Friday in Weifang, Rizhao, Shandong Province.</li>
    <li>Locals reported hearing "two loud bangs" before the object vanished.</li>
    <li>Wu Weiren, chief designer of China’s lunar exploration programme, confirmed plans to defend against asteroids.</li>
    <li>2024 YR4, a giant asteroid, is projected to intersect with Earth's orbit on December 22, 2032.</li>
    <li>China's State Department for Science and Technology is recruiting for planetary defense roles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Friday, locals in eastern China observed a cluster of lights in the sky, followed by two loud bangs. Video footage of the event circulated online, leading to various theories about the nature of the object. Some residents claimed to witness a UFO being shot down, while others speculated it was related to asteroid interception efforts.</p>

<p>In the days following the incident, authorities have reiterated that they have not received any reports of an interception or related event. Meanwhile, discussions about China's asteroid defense initiatives have gained momentum.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If China is really testing planetary defense systems, that’s actually pretty amazing. The world needs more research into asteroid interception,”</blockquote> said one commenter on social media.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident occurs in the backdrop of rising concerns about asteroid threats. Earlier this year, scientists discovered a large asteroid, 2024 YR4, potentially on a collision course with Earth. The discovery prompted China's State Department for Science and Technology to advertise job openings for a planetary defense team, highlighting the country's focus on developing early warning systems and monitoring capabilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue monitoring public reaction and investigate the claims surrounding the UFO sighting. China’s ongoing efforts in planetary defense may also lead to further announcements regarding their asteroid interception mission.</p>
