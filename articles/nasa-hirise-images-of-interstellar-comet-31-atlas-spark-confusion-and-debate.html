      <h2>NASA HiRISE Images of Interstellar Comet 31/ATLAS Spark Confusion and Debate</h2>

<p>NASA has released HiRISE images of interstellar comet 31/ATLAS, but the photographs have frustrated many sky watchers and researchers. The images, unveiled during a livestream event on October 1, 2023, were unexpectedly blurry, leading to disappointment among viewers who anticipated clearer visuals.</p>

<p>The release of these images follows a long delay attributed to a government shutdown. NASA's explanation for the image quality has prompted further discussion on what the comet truly represents, as amateur astronomers have shared clearer views online. The comet has garnered global attention since its discovery by the ATLAS observatory in Chile on July 1, 2025, due to its unusual features and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 31/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nasa released images of the comet on October 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The images were taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera.</li>
    <li>Amateur astronomers have shared clearer images of the comet online.</li>
    <li>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has commented on the comet's unusual features.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS observatory in Chile discovered interstellar comet 31/ATLAS. Following its discovery, the comet became a subject of interest among scientists and astronomers.</p>

<p>On October 1, 2023, NASA released HiRISE images of the comet during a livestream event. Viewers expected high-quality visuals, but the images were blurry, resulting in widespread disappointment.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA’s explanation has only fueled more discussion about what the comet might truly be,” said a spokesperson for the agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The release of the HiRISE images is significant given the comet's unique characteristics, including its trajectory and chemical makeup. Previous comet discoveries have often led to scientific advancements and public interest, making the blurry images a notable departure from expectations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to provide further clarification on the image quality and may release additional data regarding comet 31/ATLAS in the coming weeks.</p>
