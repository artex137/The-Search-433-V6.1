      <h2>China 'intercepted meteor or UFO' as fireball streaks over sky before exploding</h2>

<p>Social media users have speculated that a meteor or UFO was shot down by the Chinese military after videos of a fireball streaking across the sky and ending in a dramatic explosion circulated online. The flaming object was seen above Shandong province last Friday, September 12, but appears to have exploded midway through its flight.</p>

<p>This incident has attracted significant attention due to the dramatic nature of the event and ongoing concerns about aerial threats. Authorities have not yet confirmed the nature of the fireball or the claims of a missile intercept test.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: September 12, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Shandong province, China</li>
    <li>Witness reports: Two loud bangs heard, resembling artillery shells</li>
    <li>Videos: Multiple clips shared on social media platforms, including X</li>
    <li>Expert opinions: Astrophysics expert Dr. Alfredo Carpineti expressed skepticism about the object being a meteor</li>
    <li>Missile speed: Fastest hypersonic missile can reach 20,700 mph; asteroids travel between 25,000 mph to 160,000 mph</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The incident unfolded as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>On September 12, a fireball was seen streaking across the night sky in Shandong province.</li>
    <li>Videos emerged showing the object being intercepted by a bright light before exploding.</li>
    <li>Local residents reported hearing two loud bangs shortly after the explosion.</li>
    <li>Speculation about the event grew on social media, with users discussing the possibility of a missile intercept test.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Defense analysts say this fits a missile-intercept test,” said Tom Thompson, a self-proclaimed UFO researcher, regarding the incident.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Alfredo Carpineti noted, “The problem is that it partly looks like a meteor until it doesn’t. That’s why I’m sceptical.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident occurs amid heightened interest in aerial phenomena and the potential for missile defense tests. China is reportedly planning a mission to strike an asteroid with a spacecraft, similar to the U.S.'s successful Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) in 2022. Earlier this year, a "city killer" asteroid named 2024 YR4 was discovered, which could pose a significant threat to Earth in 2032.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the nature of the fireball and the claims surrounding it are ongoing. No official statements have been released by Chinese authorities as of now.</p>
