      <h2>UN International Asteroid Warning Network Monitors Comet 3I/ATLAS Ahead of December 19 Approach</h2>

<p>The UN International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) is closely monitoring interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it prepares for its closest approach to Earth on December 19. The comet is expected to pass approximately 270 million kilometers from the planet, prompting observations from telescopes worldwide.</p>

<p>The monitoring of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it enhances the understanding of interstellar objects and improves future predictions. The IAWN, coordinated by NASA, has organized an observation campaign involving over 80 observatories and citizen scientists to accurately track the comet's position and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass about 270 million kilometers from the planet.</li>
    <li>The observation campaign is approximately halfway through.</li>
    <li>More than 80 observatories are participating in the monitoring.</li>
    <li>The campaign aims to improve techniques for tracking comets and asteroids.</li>
    <li>The comet was first sighted at the end of June 2023.</li>
    <li>The campaign launch meeting in October had 171 participants.</li>
    <li>The mid-campaign teleconference on December 9 gathered 100 participants.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first sighted at the end of June 2023. An observation campaign was launched in October 2024 to prepare for monitoring interstellar objects. The comet's approach coincided with this planned campaign, allowing it to be integrated into the schedule.</p>

<p>The campaign has involved a community of observatories and citizen scientists, with growing participation. The mid-campaign teleconference on December 9 served as a platform for discussing methods and results.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The monitoring of 3I/ATLAS shows how coordination between the UN and NASA can improve the accuracy of measurements and better prepare the community for new interstellar visitors,” said James Bauer from the University of Maryland.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the first interstellar object tracked by the IAWN since its inception in 2017. The campaign not only aims to observe 3I/ATLAS but also serves to test new astrometric techniques that could enhance future tracking of similar objects.</p>

<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is considered typical for a comet, exhibiting components like water and carbon dioxide, which helps researchers in measuring and interpreting its changes as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the December 19 approach date nears, the focus remains on improving observation quality and strengthening the database to support future predictions regarding interstellar objects.</p>
