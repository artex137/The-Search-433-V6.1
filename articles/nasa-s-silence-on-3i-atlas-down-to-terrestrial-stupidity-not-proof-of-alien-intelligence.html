      <h2>NASA's silence on 3I/Atlas down to 'terrestrial stupidity', not proof of alien intelligence</h2>

<p>NASA has not revealed any information regarding the interstellar object 3I/Atlas, which its Mars orbiter may have captured, amid speculation about the agency's silence. Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, has attributed this lack of communication to the ongoing US government shutdown, which has now lasted for nine days.</p>

<p>This situation has raised concerns about the implications of NASA's communication gap. The agency has halted updates on its website due to the shutdown, leaving many to wonder about the status of 3I/Atlas and what data has been collected. Some experts believe that the delay in information may lead to misconceptions about the nature of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA has not confirmed details about 3I/Atlas.</li>
    <li>The US government shutdown has lasted for nine days as of October 8.</li>
    <li>The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) captured images of 3I/Atlas on October 3.</li>
    <li>The first image from TGO was released on October 7.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is expected to capture better images of 3I/Atlas.</li>
    <li>No official confirmation has been made regarding a NASA rover photo of 3I/Atlas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter took pictures of 3I/Atlas as it passed by Mars. The first image from this orbiting spacecraft was released on October 7. Meanwhile, the US government has been in a shutdown, affecting various federal agencies, including NASA. This shutdown has led to a freeze on updates from NASA regarding 3I/Atlas.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "I believe that the recent delay in the dissemination of data from NASA as a result of the government shutdown does not flag extraterrestrial intelligence but rather terrestrial stupidity."</blockquote>
<blockquote>House Speaker Mike Johnson mentioned, "The House is done. The ball is now in the Senate's court."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ongoing US government shutdown has led to significant disruptions across various federal agencies. NASA has been particularly affected, ceasing its regular updates and communications. This situation has sparked speculation among the public and experts regarding the nature of 3I/Atlas and the information that may be withheld.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to provide updates on 3I/Atlas once the government shutdown concludes. Meanwhile, the scientific community awaits further images and data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is anticipated to yield clearer images of the comet.</p>
