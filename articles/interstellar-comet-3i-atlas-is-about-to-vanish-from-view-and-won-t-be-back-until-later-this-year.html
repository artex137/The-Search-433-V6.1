      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is About To Vanish From View</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to disappear from view as Earth and the comet will be positioned on opposite sides of the Sun in the coming days. The comet is currently around the orbit of Mars and will be obscured by the Sun's glare until late November.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers studying interstellar objects. Authorities have noted that the comet's perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, will occur on October 29, when it will be 202 million kilometers (126 million miles) away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently setting about an hour after the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach its perihelion on October 29.</li>
    <li>At perihelion, the comet will be 202 million kilometers (126 million miles) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be 268 million kilometers (167 million miles).</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is moving almost twice as fast as previous interstellar comets.</li>
    <li>The comet is larger than 1I/’Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed as it travels through the solar system. Currently, it is several degrees away from the Sun and will soon be obscured from view. The closest distance to the Sun will occur on October 29, with the comet becoming less visible as it approaches this date.</p>

<p>After its perihelion, the comet will reappear in late November, providing another opportunity for observation before its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Studying this object is key to better understanding interstellar objects and what other solar systems might be like,” a representative from the astronomical community stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is distinct from previous interstellar comets, 1I/’Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. It is believed to have originated from the thick disk of the Milky Way, while the others came from the thin disk region. The differences in speed and size provide valuable data for researchers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will be monitored closely as it reappears in late November, allowing astronomers to gather more insights into its characteristics and behavior.</p>
