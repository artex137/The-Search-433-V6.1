      <h2>Will Mid-Michigan stargazers see interstellar comet causing astronomical excitement?</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, is currently passing through the Milky Way, with researchers from Michigan State University monitoring its journey. First discovered in July, the comet is the third recorded interstellar object in our solar system. Earlier this week, the European Space Agency released images of the comet taken by a spacecraft orbiting Mars from over 18,000 kilometres away.</p>

<p>This comet's passage is significant for astronomers and stargazers alike, as it provides a rare opportunity for study. However, researchers have noted that no new observations will be made for a few months due to the comet's current position behind the Sun. According to Tessa Frincke, an astrophysics doctoral student at MSU, the comet should become observable again later this year.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object recorded in our solar system.</li>
    <li>It was first discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency released photos of the comet taken from 18,000 kilometres away.</li>
    <li>No new observations will be made until December 2023.</li>
    <li>Amateur astronomers in Mid-Michigan may need powerful telescopes to see the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. The European Space Agency captured images of the comet passing Mars earlier this week. Currently, the comet is positioned behind the Sun, limiting visibility and observation until later this year.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “No new observations are being taken because of 3I/ATLAS’s orientation right now behind the Sun,” said Tessa Frincke, an astrophysics doctoral student at MSU.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Clearly, we know that this object is a comet,” Frincke added. “We’re seeing the typical outgassing that comets usually have.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If there’s the chance that an object gets close to a planet or spacecraft, we can get to it,” said Hiro Yaginuma, an undergraduate student studying astrophysics at MSU.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The passage of interstellar objects through our solar system is a rare occurrence, providing valuable data for researchers. The interest in 3I/ATLAS has sparked various theories and speculation regarding extraterrestrial life, especially in light of NASA's delayed updates due to a federal government shutdown.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers expect to resume observations of 3I/ATLAS in December 2023, pending its visibility as it moves out from behind the Sun.</p>
