      <h2>Not only NASA, but also the UN is monitoring the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19</h2>

<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has announced that it is tracking the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, coming within 270 million kilometers of the planet. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This monitoring is part of a broader effort to enhance the accuracy of measuring comet and asteroid trajectories. Authorities, including NASA and the UN, are collaborating to ensure that any potential threats from space objects are identified and assessed promptly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>It will come within <strong>270 million kilometers</strong> of Earth.</li>
    <li>The International Asteroid Warning Network is leading the monitoring efforts.</li>
    <li>NASA and the UN are also involved in tracking the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The monitoring of 3I/ATLAS has been ongoing as part of the IAWN's efforts to track space objects. The comet is currently on a trajectory that will bring it close to Earth on December 19.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This observation is part of a campaign to improve the measurement of comet and asteroid trajectories,” said a spokesperson for the IAWN.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The IAWN was established to enhance global cooperation in monitoring near-Earth objects. The monitoring of comets like 3I/ATLAS reflects an increasing awareness of the need to prepare for potential impacts from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with further observations planned to ensure accurate data collection.</p>
