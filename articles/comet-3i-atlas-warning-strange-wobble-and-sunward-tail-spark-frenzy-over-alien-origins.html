      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Scientific Interest with Unusual Features</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is attracting significant attention from astronomers as it displays unusual behaviour while exiting the inner solar system. The comet has exhibited a peculiar sunward-pointing dust feature and shifting jet-like structures, with a notable 'anti-tail' extending approximately 1,000,000 kilometres towards the Sun, rather than trailing behind as typical comets do.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is important as it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study the characteristics of interstellar visitors. Astronomers are currently analysing the comet's behaviour to gain insights into its rotation and surface activity, which may expand understanding of small bodies formed outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits an 'anti-tail' extending about <strong>1,000,000 km</strong> towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth occurred on <strong>19 December</strong> at approximately <strong>270,000,000 km</strong> distance.</li>
    <li>The comet has been observed over <strong>37 nights</strong> using the Two-metre Twin Telescope (TTT) at Teide Observatory in Tenerife.</li>
    <li>Researchers have inferred a nucleus rotation period of about <strong>15 hours 30 minutes</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the <strong>third confirmed interstellar object</strong> to visit the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has undergone a series of observations and analyses since its discovery. Notably, the comet's closest approach to the Sun marked a critical point in its trajectory, prompting astronomers to investigate its unusual features.</p>
<p>The observing campaign at Teide Observatory tracked the comet for over a month, allowing researchers to document its behaviour and gather data on its jet-like features and anti-tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS truly shows a structured anti-tail and measurable jet precession, it may provide one of the clearest rotational/activity case studies for an interstellar visitor to date,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the interstellar objects known as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have been studied. Each object has contributed to the understanding of small bodies formed outside the solar system, with Borisov appearing more comet-like and 'Oumuamua prompting debate due to its irregular shape and acceleration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to analyse data from 3I/ATLAS as it departs the solar system. The findings from this comet could enhance models of surface activity and dust behaviour in interstellar objects, providing valuable insights for future research.</p>
