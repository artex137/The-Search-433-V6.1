      <h2>Are Aliens Real? Science Focus Survey Reveals 87% Of Experts Believe Life Is Out There</h2>

<p>A recent survey conducted by Science Focus has found that 86.6 per cent of 1,055 scientists, including 521 astrobiologists, believe extraterrestrial life almost certainly exists somewhere in the universe. The survey highlights a significant change in the perception of alien life within the scientific community. The study, published in Nature Astronomy, was led by Peter Vickers of Durham University.</p>

<p>This survey matters because it reflects a growing acceptance of the possibility of life beyond Earth among scientists. The shift is underscored by the recent passage of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which serves as a reminder of our cosmic connectivity and the potential for life in other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Survey conducted by Science Focus with 1,055 scientists.</li>
    <li>86.6% of respondents believe extraterrestrial life exists.</li>
    <li>58.2% of astrobiologists believe intelligent alien life is present.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The object reached a speed of 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>It was detected by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun on 29 October 2025 at a distance of 1.36 AU.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS survey in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile. The object emerged from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, moving at an astonishing speed of 137,000 miles per hour. It reached its closest point to the Sun on 29 October 2025, at a distance of 1.36 AU.</p>

<p>Subsequent analysis of 3I/ATLAS has provided valuable data about the potential for life beyond Earth. Researchers are now focusing on the implications of such interstellar objects for the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We now know that most stars have a planetary system. That means there are loads of places where life can arise,” said Mike Garrett, Sir Bernard Lovell Chair of Astrophysics at the University of Manchester.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “We're in a much better position to discover it now than we were five years ago,” Garrett added, noting advancements in technology that aid in the search for extraterrestrial life.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Copernican principle, which posits that Earth is not unique in the universe, plays a crucial role in the scientific community's evolving perspective on extraterrestrial life. The vast number of stars in our galaxy alone—estimated between 100 billion and 400 billion—reinforces the idea that life could exist elsewhere.</p>

<p>As research progresses, the focus has shifted from searching for microbial 'biosignatures' to seeking 'technosignatures,' which include measurable evidence of technology from other civilizations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community is preparing for further exploration and analysis of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS. Researchers are optimistic about upcoming discoveries, aided by advancements in computing and observational technology, such as the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>
