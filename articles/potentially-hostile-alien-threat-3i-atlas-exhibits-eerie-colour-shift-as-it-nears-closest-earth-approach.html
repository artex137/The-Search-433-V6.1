      <h2>'Potentially Hostile Alien Threat': 3I/ATLAS Exhibits Eerie Colour Shift As It Nears Closest Earth Approach</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has developed a distinct greenish glow as it approaches its closest point to Earth, prompting renewed interest and debate among astronomers. The object is currently passing through the inner Solar System at high speed, with no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This colour change has sparked speculation regarding the object's composition and potential threat level. While NASA has attributed the phenomenon to standard cometary chemistry, some scientists argue that its behaviour is anomalous and may suggest an extraterrestrial origin. NASA has initiated a comprehensive observational campaign to study 3I/ATLAS using multiple space telescopes and planetary rovers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Current location: Near Zaniah, a triple-star system in the constellation Virgo</li>
    <li>Observation tools: Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Mars rovers and orbiters</li>
    <li>Colour change observed: Faint greenish glow</li>
    <li>NASA's assessment: Declared as a non-threatening comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has made a notable passage through the inner Solar System, with its perihelion occurring recently. Observations from Hawaii have highlighted a significant change in the object's appearance immediately after it passed behind the Sun. This change has been documented as a greenish glow, raising questions about its nature.</p>

<p>NASA has launched a massive observational effort to compile data on 3I/ATLAS, focusing on its composition and trajectory. The agency has stated that the object is a standard comet, despite ongoing speculation from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If the hypothesis about a technological artefact ends up being correct, then there are two possible implications: first that the intentions of 3I/ATLAS are entirely benign, and second that they are malign.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The glowing light is largely produced by diatomic carbon (C₂), which is a highly reactive molecule made of two carbon atoms that naturally gives off light in green wavelengths.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual features of 3I/ATLAS have led to discussions about the possibility of alien technology. Some scientists, including Harvard Professor Avi Loeb, have urged caution against jumping to conclusions about the object's nature. Previous interstellar objects have also drawn attention, but 3I/ATLAS has been particularly notable due to its distinct characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further observations and analyses are expected to shed light on its composition and behaviour, with no immediate plans for further action reported.</p>
