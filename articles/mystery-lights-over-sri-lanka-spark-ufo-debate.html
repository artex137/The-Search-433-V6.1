      <h2>Mystery Lights Over Sri Lanka Spark UFO Debate</h2>

<p>A report of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) hovering near a shrimp farm in Sri Lanka has sparked a debate among scientists and the public. The incident occurred in the early hours of last Friday, around 3:00 am, near the Iranawila “Voice of America” transmission center, according to Professor Chandana Jayaratne, Head of the Department of Physics at the University of Colombo. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The sighting has drawn attention to a growing number of similar reports in the region. Authorities are currently reviewing video footage of the incident, which has circulated widely and led to increased interest from researchers. Professor Jayaratne stated that while such events often lead to speculation, the focus should be on scientific examination and verification of the claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on Friday, at 3:00 am</li>
    <li>Location: Near Iranawila “Voice of America” transmission center</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Friday, at around 3:00 am, a shrimp farmer observed a flashing light hovering above his farm near the Iranawila transmission center. He reported pointing a flashlight at the object, which then moved rapidly in his direction. The farmer panicked and ran, claiming the light appeared to chase him. A colleague recorded the event, capturing the lights that remained visible until about 5:45 am.</p>

<p>Following the incident, Professor Jayaratne has received the video for analysis. He noted that similar reports of unexplained lights have been submitted to him and the Arthur C. Clarke Center for Modern Technologies for evaluation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While such sightings often trigger speculation, the priority is to examine the scientific background and verify the authenticity of the images and claims,” said Professor Chandana Jayaratne.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a trend of increasing reports of unusual aerial phenomena in Sri Lanka. The public's interest in UFOs has been growing, with many citizens submitting their sightings for scientific review. The Arthur C. Clarke Center for Modern Technologies has been a key institution in investigating such claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to analyze the video footage and assess whether the lights can be explained by known natural phenomena, aircraft activity, or optical effects. Further investigations may be warranted based on the findings.</p>
