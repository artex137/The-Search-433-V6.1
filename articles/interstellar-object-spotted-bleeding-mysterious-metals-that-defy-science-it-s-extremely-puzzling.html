      <h2>Interstellar object spotted 'bleeding' mysterious metals that defy science: 'It's extremely puzzling'</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been observed emitting unusual amounts of nickel and iron in its gaseous coma, according to new findings from the Very Large Telescope in Chile. The study, published on October 1, 2025, reveals that the comet's nickel-to-iron ratio challenges existing models of comet formation, as it behaves in ways not typically seen in comets within our Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it offers insights into the chemical composition of interstellar comets and may reshape our understanding of cometary activity. Researchers are now analyzing the data to explore the implications of these findings on current scientific models.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object observed in our Solar System.</li>
    <li>Nickel was detected at a distance of 581 million kilometres (361 million miles) from the sun.</li>
    <li>Iron was first detected at a distance of 396 million kilometres (246 million miles) from the sun.</li>
    <li>The comet was observed using the VLT's UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph.</li>
    <li>The study indicates a skewed nickel-to-iron ratio, far beyond that of typical Solar System comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS formed in another star system and was ejected into interstellar space. It has drifted for millions or even billions of years before arriving at our Solar System, approaching from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

<p>Recent observations from the Very Large Telescope revealed the comet's unusual emissions of nickel and iron. Nickel was consistently detected throughout the comet's activity, while iron appeared as it drew closer to the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is extremely puzzling,” wrote the study's authors, emphasizing that the skewed nickel-to-iron ratio challenges existing models of comet formation and activity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS carries a chemical signature that challenges existing models of cometary formation and activity,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies have found nickel and iron in about 20 Solar System comets, but the ratios were significantly lower and typically matched the sun's composition. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding the differences between interstellar comets and those originating within our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS to determine whether its unique properties are indicative of rare chemical compositions or other phenomena. Further studies may provide clearer insights into the behavior of metals in the cold reaches of space.</p>
