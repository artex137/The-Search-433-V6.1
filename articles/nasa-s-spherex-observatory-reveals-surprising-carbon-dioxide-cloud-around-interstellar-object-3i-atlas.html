      <h2>NASA’s SPHEREx Observatory Reveals Surprising Carbon Dioxide Cloud Around Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's SPHEREx Space Observatory has observed a significant cloud of carbon dioxide surrounding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS between August 8 and August 12, 2025. This discovery has drawn the attention of astronomers and space enthusiasts, as no water gas was detected, contrary to earlier claims. The mass loss rate of the carbon dioxide cloud is approximately 70 kilograms per second.</p>

<p>This finding is important as it challenges previous assumptions about the composition of 3I/ATLAS. The SPHEREx team has noted the absence of a bright water coma, which raises questions about the object's nature. The data collected could reshape our understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation period: August 8-12, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide mass loss rate: approximately 70 kg/s</li>
    <li>Distance of CO2 cloud: up to at least 348,000 km from 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Nucleus diameter estimation: 46 km</li>
    <li>Previous water loss rate claimed: approximately 40 kg/s</li>
    <li>James Webb Space Telescope also observed 3I/ATLAS on August 6, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 6, 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope captured images of 3I/ATLAS. Following this, NASA's SPHEREx Space Observatory conducted observations from August 8 to August 12, revealing a cloud of carbon dioxide surrounding the object.</p>
<p>The SPHEREx data indicated that while carbon dioxide was present, there was no detectable water vapor, contradicting earlier reports. This has prompted further investigation into the composition and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The lack of a bright water coma is particularly puzzling, given that 3I/ATLAS was observed at a distance where one would expect a significant amount of water ice to sublimate into gas,” said a member of the SPHEREx team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previously, 3I/ATLAS was thought to be a water-rich comet based on initial observations. The latest findings suggest that it may not fit the typical profile of such objects, as the absence of detectable water raises questions about its formation and previous classifications.</p>
<p>The observations align with a growing interest in the study of interstellar objects and their potential implications for understanding the formation of the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers anticipate further insights as data from the James Webb Space Telescope continues to be analyzed. As the Sun's heat increases in the coming months, more information about the true nature of 3I/ATLAS is expected to emerge.</p>
