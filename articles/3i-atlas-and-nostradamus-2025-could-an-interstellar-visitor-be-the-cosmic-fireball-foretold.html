      <h2>3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth Amid Nostradamus Prophecies</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is approaching its closest point to Earth in mid-December 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), the object has generated public interest due to its predicted trajectory and historical references in the writings of Nostradamus.</p>

<p>This convergence of prophecy and astronomy has sparked discussions among scholars and scientists. The European Space Agency (ESA) is closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS, while NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office has confirmed that the object poses no threat of collision with Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nearest pass to Earth estimated at 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 168 million miles) in mid-December 2025.</li>
    <li>Only the third known interstellar object, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>Nostradamus’ writings reference a “fireball from the cosmos” in 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers with ATLAS discovered 3I/ATLAS. The object’s hyperbolic orbit confirmed it as an interstellar visitor. NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office later confirmed its origins outside our solar system. The closest approach to the Sun is scheduled for October 29, 2025, with the nearest pass to Earth expected in mid-December.</p>

<p>As the end of 2025 approaches, discussions about Nostradamus’ predictions have resurfaced, particularly regarding his writings about cosmic events and their implications for humanity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Even if prophecy draws people in for the wrong reasons, it’s still encouraging them to look up — to ask questions, to wonder, to care,” said an unnamed astrophysicist regarding public interest in 3I/ATLAS and Nostradamus’ predictions.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Nostradamus, a 16th-century French astrologer, is known for his cryptic verses that some interpret as prophecies about significant global events. His predictions for 2025 include references to a long war ending and a plague returning, which have coincided with current global issues.</p>

<p>The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS has reignited interest in these writings, prompting both scientific inquiry and public speculation about potential connections between the comet and Nostradamus' predictions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, astronomers and space agencies will continue to monitor its trajectory. While there are currently no indications of a threat, the public fascination with the intersection of science and prophecy will likely persist as 2025 draws to a close.</p>
