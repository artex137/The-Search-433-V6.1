      <h2>Hearing Wrap Up: Government Must Be More Transparent About UAPs</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON—The Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets held a hearing today titled “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection,” focusing on concerns regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) and federal agency disclosures.</p>

<p>The hearing addressed transparency issues within the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and the intelligence community. Witnesses emphasized the need for Congress to enhance protections for whistleblowers who provide information on UAPs. The federal government has been criticized for not adequately informing Americans about UAP-related programs and expenditures.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: Today</li>
    <li>Location: Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Agency: Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets</li>
    <li>Key witnesses: UAP journalist George Knapp, Chief Alexandro Wiggins, U.S. Air Force veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli, U.S. Air Force veteran Dylan Borland</li>
    <li>Major issue: Lack of transparency regarding UAP programs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The hearing commenced with testimonies from various witnesses who highlighted the ongoing concerns about UAP disclosures. George Knapp presented evidence from documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, contradicting the government's public stance on UAPs. Chief Wiggins discussed aviation and maritime safety related to UAP encounters. The testimonies collectively underscored the need for improved whistleblower protections and transparency.</p>

<p>Members of the task force raised questions about Congress's role in enhancing these protections and ensuring oversight of UAP-related programs. They also discussed the challenges faced by whistleblowers in coming forward with information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The public has been told over and over since the late 40s, ‘there’s nothing to worry about here.’ These mysterious craft seen by millions of people... are not real,” said George Knapp, UAP journalist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When crews and watchstanders observe objects that maneuver or accelerate in ways that do not match known profiles... that is first and foremost a safety issue,” stated Chief Alexandro Wiggins.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Transparency is the foundation of truth. Without it, witnesses like us are dismissed,” said U.S. Air Force veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Reporting without stigma protection without retribution. Sailors need to know that reporting UAP encounters will not harm their careers,” emphasized Chief Wiggins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The hearing reflects ongoing debates about UAPs and government transparency dating back to the late 1940s. Witnesses have repeatedly expressed concerns about the government's dismissive attitude towards UAP sightings and the stigma faced by those who report them. Whistleblower protections have been a recurring theme, with many advocates calling for stronger measures to encourage reporting without fear of retribution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress will consider recommendations from the hearing to improve oversight and protections for whistleblowers. Further investigations into the classification and declassification of UAP-related information are expected as lawmakers seek to enhance transparency.</p>
