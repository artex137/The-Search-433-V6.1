      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-24 15:29 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to Reach Closest Distance to the Sun on 29 October 2025</h2>
<p>An interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) will reach its nearest point to the sun on 29 October 2025, passing at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units, or approximately 210 million kilometres. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This close approach is significant for astronomers, who are monitoring the comet to gather insights into material from beyond our solar system. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has confirmed the comet’s trajectory will bring it just within the orbit of Mars, and it poses no threat to Earth or the sun, according to NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion on 29-30 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass 1.4 astronomical units from the sun, approximately 210 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will come within 1.8 astronomical units, or 270 million kilometres, of Earth.</li>
    <li>It was first detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of 60 kilometres per second.</li>
    <li>NASA expects the comet to disappear from view around September 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025, about 670 million kilometres from Earth. As it approaches the sun, it will reach its closest point on 29 October 2025. Following this event, it will continue on its hyperbolic trajectory, crossing the orbit of Mars before leaving the solar system entirely.</p>

<p>NASA scientists have indicated that tracking the comet will become increasingly difficult as it nears the sun, with ground-based telescopes expected to lose sight of it around September 2025. Observations will resume in early December once the comet re-emerges from behind the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth or the sun,” NASA stated. “It will continue its journey away from the solar system once it rounds the sun later this year.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Professor Darryl Seligman of Michigan State University remarked, “This event offers a rare glimpse of material from beyond the sun's neighbourhood, calling it an important chance to study interstellar matter.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Professor David Jewitt of UCLA dismissed speculation about the comet, stating, “It’s not a spaceship.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows a hyperbolic orbit, indicating it did not form within our solar system. This is in contrast to typical comets that return repeatedly to the sun. Previous comets, such as Comet ISON in 2013 and Comet Lovejoy in 2011, passed much closer to the sun, but 3I/ATLAS will remain far outside the sun's immediate zone of influence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After reaching its closest point to the sun, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey away from the solar system. NASA will continue to monitor the comet with space-based instruments until it reappears in December 2025.</p>
