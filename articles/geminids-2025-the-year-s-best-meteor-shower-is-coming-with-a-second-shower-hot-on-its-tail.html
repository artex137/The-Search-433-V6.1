      <h2>Geminids 2025: The year's best meteor shower is coming, with a second shower hot on its tail</h2>

<p>The Geminid meteor shower has begun, peaking overnight on December 13 and 14, 2025, with up to 150 meteors visible per hour from the Northern Hemisphere. The event will occur in mostly moonless skies, providing optimal conditions for viewing.</p>

<p>This meteor shower is significant because it is the most prolific of the year, offering a spectacular display for skywatchers. The American Meteor Society encourages viewers to look for meteors after 10 p.m. local time, with the best viewing occurring later into the night.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Peak viewing dates:</strong> December 13-14, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Meteor rate:</strong> Up to 150 meteors per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Best viewing time:</strong> After 10 p.m.</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Northern Hemisphere</li>
    <li><strong>Moon phase:</strong> 28% illuminated waning crescent rises at 2:30 a.m.</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Asteroid 3200 Phaethon</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Geminid meteor shower has been active since December 4, 2025, and will continue until December 17, 2025. The peak nights on December 13 and 14 are expected to be the highlight of this year’s display.</p>

<p>Following the Geminids, the Ursid meteor shower will begin on December 17, peaking on December 21-22, producing around 10 meteors per hour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Geminids are often bright, slow-moving and colorful,” said an astronomer from the American Meteor Society. “This is due to their denser composition from the asteroid they originate from.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Geminids are unique as they are the only major meteor shower caused by an asteroid rather than a comet. This characteristic contributes to their brightness and the variety of colors observed during the shower.</p>

<p>Previous years have seen similar displays, with skywatchers often encouraged to find dark locations away from artificial lights for the best experience.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the Geminids, skywatchers can anticipate the Ursid meteor shower, which will also offer viewing opportunities in the dark skies of a new moon.</p>
