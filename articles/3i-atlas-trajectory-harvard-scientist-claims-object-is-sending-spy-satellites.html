      <h2>3I/ATLAS Trajectory: Harvard Scientist Claims Object Is Sending Spy 'Satellites'</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has proposed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, first detected in July 2025, may not be a natural comet but rather a massive extraterrestrial 'mothership' deploying smaller surveillance 'satellites' to monitor our solar system, particularly Jupiter. This hypothesis has emerged amid ongoing debate within the scientific community regarding the object's unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>The significance of this claim lies in its potential implications for our understanding of extraterrestrial life and cosmic phenomena. While NASA and other planetary scientists assert that 3I/ATLAS is a natural object, Loeb argues that its behavior and trajectory warrant further investigation into its origins and purpose.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS first appeared in July 2025.</li>
  <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on 29 October 2025.</li>
  <li>The object will pass 270 million kilometres from Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
  <li>It came within 29 million kilometres of Mars in early October 2025.</li>
  <li>Predicted encounter with Jupiter is set for March 2026.</li>
  <li>Perijove distance forecasted at 53.445 million kilometres, near Jupiter's Hill's radius of 53.502 million kilometres.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, marking it as the third confirmed interstellar object. Following its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025, significant observations revealed its unusual emissions and movement patterns. In early October 2025, it passed within 29 million kilometres of Mars. The object is expected to reach Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If this object turns out to be artificial, it will redefine not just astronomy, but civilisation itself,” said Professor Loeb, emphasizing the need for careful examination of interstellar objects.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discoveries of 'Oumuamua and Borisov, both of which were also identified as interstellar visitors. The scientific community has been divided over the interpretation of such objects, particularly regarding the potential for artificial origins. Loeb's previous claims about 'Oumuamua have sparked similar debates about the nature of interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community continues to investigate the properties and trajectory of 3I/ATLAS, with calls for increased scrutiny of interstellar visitors. Further observations are planned as the object approaches Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
