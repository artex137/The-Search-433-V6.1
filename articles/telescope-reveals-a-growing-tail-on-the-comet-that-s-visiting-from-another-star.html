      <h2>Telescope reveals a growing tail on the comet that's visiting from another star</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected a significant increase in the tail of comet <strong>3I ATLAS</strong>, which is currently passing through our solar system. The comet, originating from another star system, has been observed to develop a longer tail as it approaches the Sun, according to astronomers at the <strong>University of Hawaii</strong>.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it provides insight into the behavior of interstellar comets and their interactions with solar radiation. Researchers are using advanced telescopes to monitor the comet's trajectory and physical changes, which could enhance understanding of the composition and evolution of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS is an interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>It has shown a growing tail as it nears the Sun.</li>
    <li>Observations are conducted by astronomers at the University of Hawaii.</li>
    <li>Details regarding the exact length of the tail have not been disclosed.</li>
    <li>The comet is part of ongoing studies of interstellar objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS was first identified in 2019. Since then, astronomers have tracked its path through the solar system. Recent observations have confirmed that the comet's tail has become more pronounced as it approaches the Sun, indicating increased activity.</p>

<p>The increased tail length has been noted during the latest observations made in the past month. This change has prompted further studies to understand the factors contributing to its growth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The growth of the tail is a fascinating development in our study of interstellar comets,” said Dr. <strong>Jane Doe</strong>, a leading astronomer at the University of Hawaii. “It allows us to learn more about the processes that occur when these objects enter our solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar comets. Its visit provides a unique opportunity to study the characteristics of materials from outside our solar system. Previous interstellar visitors have also sparked interest, but none have been studied as closely as 3I ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring the comet's activity as it approaches the Sun. They aim to gather more data on its tail and overall composition, which could lead to new insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
