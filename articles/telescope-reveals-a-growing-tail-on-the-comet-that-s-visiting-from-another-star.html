      <h2>Telescope reveals a growing tail on the comet that’s visiting from another star</h2>

<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Telescope observations have revealed a growing tail on the comet 3I-Atlas, which is visiting from another star. The images, taken by the Gemini South telescope in Chile in late August 2025, show the comet speeding toward the sun with a wide coma of dust and gas surrounding it.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it confirms that 3I-Atlas is becoming more active as it travels through our solar system. The National Space Foundation’s NoirLab, which operates the telescope, reported that this is only the third known interstellar object to approach Earth. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun at the end of October, remaining just within the orbit of Mars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I-Atlas is an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Images were taken by the Gemini South telescope in La Serena, Chile.</li>
    <li>The observations occurred in late August 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the sun will happen at the end of October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will stay within the orbit of Mars during its closest approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Late August 2025: The Gemini South telescope captures detailed images of comet 3I-Atlas, showing a growing tail and a wide coma of dust and gas.</p>
<p>The observations confirm increased activity of the comet as it travels through the solar system.</p>
<p>End of October 2025: 3I-Atlas is expected to make its closest approach to the sun, remaining inside the orbit of Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These new images confirm that the comet is becoming more active as it plows harmlessly through our solar system,” said a spokesperson for the National Space Foundation’s NoirLab.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I-Atlas is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. Its observations contribute to ongoing research into the characteristics and behavior of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The upcoming closest approach to the sun will allow scientists to gather more data on 3I-Atlas as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>
