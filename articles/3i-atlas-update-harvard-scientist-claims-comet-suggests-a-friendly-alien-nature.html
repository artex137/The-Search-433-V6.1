      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Harvard Scientist Claims Comet Suggests a Friendly Alien Nature</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has claimed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may suggest a friendly nature for extraterrestrial life, based on new findings about its chemical composition. The comet, which was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, is currently passing through our solar system and will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge of celestial chemistry. According to NASA astrochemist Martin Cordiner, the comet contains an unusually high concentration of organic molecules, which may provide insight into the building blocks of life and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has an estimated nucleus size between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is rich in methanol and hydrogen cyanide, with methanol making up about eight percent of its vapour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its detection, scientists began to closely monitor the comet with various instruments across the solar system. On October 30, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to the sun, becoming very active. Between November 2 and November 25, the European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft observed the comet, noting its bright coma and dual tails. NASA released new images of 3I/ATLAS on November 19, 2025, followed by Hubble's observations on November 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The anomalously large ratio of methanol to hydrogen-cyanide production by 3I/ATLAS suggests a friendly nature for this interstellar visitor."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Martin Cordiner noted, "Molecules like hydrogen cyanide and methanol are at trace abundances and not the dominant constituents of our own comets. Here we see that, actually, in this alien comet they're very abundant."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of such comets provides valuable insights into the chemistry of celestial bodies formed around other stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, scientists will analyze data from ongoing observations to further understand its origins and implications for the possibility of life beyond Earth.</p>
