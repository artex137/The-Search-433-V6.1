      <h2>US Hellfire Missile Hits UFO and It Just Keeps Flying</h2>

<p>On Tuesday evening at approximately 7:42 p.m. PST, a U.S. military drone fired an AGM-114 Hellfire missile at an unidentified flying object (UFO) over restricted airspace near Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, according to Pentagon officials. The missile struck the object, described as a luminous, disc-shaped craft approximately 30 feet in diameter, but the craft continued its flight unscathed, leaving no debris or traceable evidence.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as it marks the first publicly acknowledged use of a Hellfire missile against a UFO. The event has raised questions about the nature and origin of the object, prompting the Pentagon to increase surveillance and investigate further. Rear Adm. Laura Hensley, a Pentagon spokesperson, stated, “We are investigating the event and analyzing all available data to determine the nature and origin of the object.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on Tuesday evening, approximately 7:42 p.m. PST.</li>
    <li>Location: Restricted airspace near Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada.</li>
    <li>Object size: Approximately 30 feet in diameter.</li>
    <li>Missile used: AGM-114 Hellfire.</li>
    <li>Witness: Anonymous Air Force technician reported the missile struck the UFO directly.</li>
    <li>Object emitted a brief pulse of light after the missile hit.</li>
    <li>No debris or traceable evidence was found after the encounter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The encounter began when radar systems detected an unidentified object moving at high speed within a no-fly zone. A Reaper drone, deployed for surveillance, was authorized to engage the target after the object failed to respond to communication attempts. The missile struck the object, resulting in a visible explosion, but the craft continued its trajectory without apparent damage. It then accelerated and disappeared from radar within seconds.</p>

<p>The Pentagon has confirmed the incident but has provided limited details due to national security concerns.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It was like the missile just vanished into it,” said an anonymous Air Force technician present at the scene.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are investigating the event and analyzing all available data to determine the nature and origin of the object,” said Rear Adm. Laura Hensley.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a series of UAP sightings reported by military pilots and civilian observers in recent years. In 2022, Congress established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to investigate such phenomena. AARO's latest report, released in July 2025, documented 274 unexplained sightings, though none involved direct engagement until now.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations continue, the Pentagon has increased surveillance around Nellis Air Force Base and other sensitive sites. There are also calls for an emergency congressional hearing to address the implications of advanced, unidentified craft operating in U.S. airspace.</p>
