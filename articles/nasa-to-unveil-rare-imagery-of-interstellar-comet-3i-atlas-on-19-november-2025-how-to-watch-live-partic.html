      <h2>NASA to unveil rare imagery of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA will showcase new imagery of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a live event at 3 p.m. EST on Wednesday, 19 November 2025. The event will take place at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides the public with a detailed look at one of the rarest visitors to our solar system. The comet, discovered by the ATLAS observatory earlier this year, is only the third confirmed object to enter our solar system from outside the Milky Way. NASA aims to share findings from multiple missions that have observed the comet as it travels through space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> 19 November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Event Time:</strong> 3 p.m. EST</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Broadcast Platforms:</strong> NASA+, NASA mobile app, NASA website, YouTube channel, Amazon Prime</li>
    <li><strong>Hashtag for Questions:</strong> AskNASA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered earlier this year by the ATLAS observatory. Since then, NASA has initiated multiple observations of the comet, which has led to the upcoming live event to showcase new imagery and findings.</p>

<p>The event will feature senior NASA leaders discussing the scientific importance of the comet and its observations. Key contributors include Amit Kshatriya, Nicky Fox, Shawn Domagal Goldman, and Tom Statler.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, NASA Associate Administrator, said, "Our role in this mission is crucial for understanding the dynamics of interstellar objects."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nicky Fox, head of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, added, "The scientific goals connected to observing 3I/ATLAS are vital for our understanding of the universe."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Shawn Domagal Goldman, acting director of the Astrophysics Division, stated, "Interstellar comets expand our understanding of the wider cosmos."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tom Statler, lead scientist for solar system small bodies, noted, "3I/ATLAS is unique compared to typical comets, and studying it helps advance our knowledge of planetary formation."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS provide insights into conditions beyond our solar system. They originate in other planetary systems, and their composition can reveal clues about the environments where stars and planets formed. By comparing interstellar comets to native solar system comets, astronomers can better understand processes like planet formation and chemical evolution across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will conduct the live event on 19 November 2025, where scientists will present the new imagery and findings related to 3I/ATLAS. The agency will also engage with the public by answering questions submitted via social media during the broadcast.</p>
