      <h2>Boulder scientists track interstellar comet that sparked unfounded alien theories</h2>

<p>Scientists in Boulder have tracked a rare interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS as it travels through Earth’s solar system. The comet was first observed on July 1 and is only the third known object to enter the solar system from another solar system, according to NASA. The comet poses no threat to humanity, as it will pass about 170 million miles from Earth.</p>

<p>This tracking effort is significant for understanding the characteristics of interstellar objects. Researchers at the Southwest Research Institute and the University of Colorado Boulder are utilizing existing NASA spacecraft to gather data on the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS first observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is approximately 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>Tracked by teams at the Southwest Research Institute and CU Boulder.</li>
    <li>Data collected using NASA’s PUNCH and MAVEN spacecraft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, scientists first observed comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, the comet sparked various unfounded theories, including claims that it was an alien spacecraft. Researchers have since confirmed that it is a standard comet.</p>
<p>Teams at the Southwest Research Institute used data from the PUNCH spacecraft to monitor the comet for about two months. The PUNCH spacecraft, which is designed to study the sun, provided nearly continuous data on the comet's passage.</p>
<p>A separate team at CU Boulder captured images of the comet using NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft in September and October 2025, marking another significant effort to study its properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re actually learning about other solar systems because we’re seeing how different these comets are from our local comets and what differences they might’ve had during formation,” said Simon Porter, Senior Research Analyst at the Southwest Research Institute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every measurement we can make of this comet is precious and helps to open up new understanding of interstellar objects,” stated Justin Deighan, a research scientist at LASP and deputy principal investigator for MAVEN.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. Previous objects, such as 'Oumuamua and comet Borisov, have also prompted scientific interest and speculation regarding their origins and compositions.</p>
<p>The study of interstellar comets is crucial for expanding our knowledge of the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from both the PUNCH and MAVEN spacecraft to gain insights into the comet’s characteristics, including its rotation and dust composition. This ongoing analysis may lead to new discoveries about the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
