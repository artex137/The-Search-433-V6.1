      <h2>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is wrapped in carbon dioxide fog, NASA space telescope reveals</h2>

<p>NASA's SPHEREx space observatory has detected significant amounts of carbon dioxide gas surrounding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Deep Random Survey remote telescope in Chile. This comet is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, and it is the largest and brightest one yet.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it helps scientists understand how comets from other star systems compare to those formed in our solar system. Researchers are using various instruments, including SPHEREx, to study 3I/ATLAS in detail. The findings could lead to new insights into the formation and evolution of comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the largest and brightest interstellar comet observed to date.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx detected carbon dioxide gas and water ice in the comet's coma and nucleus.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion, or its closest approach to the sun, in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the Deep Random Survey remote telescope in Chile identified comet 3I/ATLAS. This comet, originating from outside our solar system, has since been closely monitored by scientists.</p>
<p>NASA's SPHEREx has provided significant findings, including the presence of carbon dioxide gas in the comet's coma and water ice in its nucleus. The team expects further observations as the comet approaches perihelion in late October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“SPHEREx’s finding very large amounts of vaporized carbon dioxide gas around 3I/ATLAS told us it could be like a normal solar system comet,” said Carey Lisse, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University and member of the SPHEREx science team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is behaving like a normal, well-thermally processed, natural solar system cometary object does,” Lisse added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. Its composition, including carbon dioxide and water ice, provides insights into the characteristics of comets from other star systems compared to those formed within our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As SPHEREx continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS, scientists expect to observe changes in the comet's coma and tail as it approaches the sun. A more detailed paper on these findings is expected to be published soon by the SPHEREx team.</p>
