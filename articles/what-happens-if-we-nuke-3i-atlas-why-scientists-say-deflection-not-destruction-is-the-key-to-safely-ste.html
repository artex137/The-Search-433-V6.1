      <h2>Scientists Discuss Potential Deflection of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Scientists have assessed the implications of using nuclear devices on comet 3I/ATLAS, which recently made its closest approach to the Sun, coming within approximately <strong>126 million miles (203 million km)</strong> of the star. The comet is currently obscured by the Sun from Earth-based telescopes and is expected to reappear for predawn viewers around <strong>November 11</strong>, with its nearest approach to Earth projected for <strong>December 19</strong>, at about <strong>168 million miles (270 million km)</strong>. According to the European Space Agency and NASA, the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This analysis of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it raises questions about planetary defense strategies. The possibility of a comet altering its course towards Earth prompts discussions about whether nuclear devices could be employed to redirect such an object rather than destroy it.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest pass to the Sun on a date not disclosed.</li>
<li>Closest approach to Earth is expected on <strong>December 19</strong>.</li>
<li>Distance from Earth during closest approach: <strong>168 million miles (270 million km)</strong>.</li>
<li>Comet's distance from the Sun: <strong>126 million miles (203 million km)</strong>.</li>
<li>Agencies involved: European Space Agency, NASA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, has made its closest approach to the Sun. It is now hidden behind the Sun from Earth-based telescopes but is expected to reappear in early November. The nearest approach to Earth is anticipated in December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Nuking a comet isn’t about blowing it up,” scientists from Los Alamos National Laboratory said, emphasizing the importance of deflection over destruction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Nuclear munitions are by far the most efficient in terms of yield-per-unit-mass launched and are technically mature,” according to a 2009 paper on impact hazard mitigation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that simply destroying a comet could lead to more dangerous fragments. Instead, scientists advocate for a method known as ablation, where a nuclear device's energy vaporizes part of the comet's surface, providing a push that alters its trajectory.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research continues on the best methods to deflect comets and asteroids. No specific investigations or timelines for action on 3I/ATLAS have been disclosed at this time.</p>
