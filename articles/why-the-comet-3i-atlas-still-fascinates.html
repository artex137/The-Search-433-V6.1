      <h2>Why the comet 3I/Atlas still fascinates</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar visitor, reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023, and is now rapidly heading back toward the stars. This comet has intrigued astronomers and the public alike as it traversed our solar system.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/Atlas lies in its status as the third object discovered to have entered our solar system from interstellar space. Astronomers have utilized powerful telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, to study this unique cosmic body. Its journey has sparked interest in the scientific community and among space enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>It was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar object after Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>Dozens of telescopes, including the Hubble and James Webb, have observed the comet.</li>
    <li>It is estimated that there could be more interstellar comets than stars in our galaxy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers discovered 3I/Atlas as it entered our solar system. Since then, it has passed close to Mars and has been observed by various telescopes. The comet reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2023, and is now on its way back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“With the increasing depth and completeness of surveys of the sky, we will find many more of these interstellar visitors,” said astronomer Avi Loeb from Harvard University. “3I/Atlas is a reminder of our place in the universe.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas follows Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object, detected in October 2017, and Comet 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019. These discoveries have prompted astronomers to enhance their search for similar objects, as they provide insights into the formation of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its journey away from the Sun, astronomers will focus on analyzing data collected during its passage. There are no plans for a probe to visit this comet, but future interstellar objects may present opportunities for closer study.</p>
