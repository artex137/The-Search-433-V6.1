      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Jupiter</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has accelerated to over 100 km/h as it moves through the Solar System, with a close approach to Jupiter scheduled for March 16, 2026. This comet, the third confirmed interstellar object, is on a hyperbolic orbit and is expected to pass approximately 54 million kilometers from Jupiter.</p>

<p>The significance of this approach lies in its potential to alter the comet's trajectory as it exits the Solar System. While numerical models indicate that this encounter does not pose a risk to the planets, the gravitational influence of Jupiter will likely modify 3I/ATLAS's path before it continues its journey into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS scanning system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Current speed is approximately 58 km/h relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter is projected for March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>Distance from Jupiter at closest approach will be about 0.36 astronomical units (approximately 54 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be between 7 and 14 billion years old.</li>
    <li>It was last within 0.2 astronomical units of Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS as an object with an eccentric trajectory. As observations continued, it was confirmed as a comet on a one-way passage through the Solar System. The comet crossed the orbit of Mars on October 3, 2025, before reaching perihelion in October, slightly inside Mars's orbit. It then made a close pass near Venus.</p>

<p>As it approaches Jupiter, telescopes such as Hubble and other ground-based instruments are monitoring its activity to refine its orbit and provide observation opportunities for researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The gravitational influence of Jupiter will be significant in altering the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS before it exits the Solar System,” said a researcher from the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique as it originates from outside the Solar System, unlike ordinary comets that belong to the Oort Cloud or Kuiper Belt. Its long journey through the galaxy has likely been shaped by multiple encounters with stars and gravitational forces.</p>

<p>Prior interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also provided valuable insights into the composition and dynamics of celestial bodies from outside our solar neighborhood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. The comet's trajectory will be analyzed post-encounter to understand the effects of Jupiter's gravity on its path into interstellar space.</p>
