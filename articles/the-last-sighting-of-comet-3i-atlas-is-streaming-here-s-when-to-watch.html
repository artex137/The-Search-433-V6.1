      <h2>The Last Sighting of Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Streaming — Here's When to Watch</h2>

<p>The final opportunity to view Comet 3I/ATLAS occurs on Thursday, January 22, at 11:30 p.m. GMT (6:30 p.m. EST) as it streams live from Manciano, Italy. Poor weather conditions previously postponed the broadcast, but it now marks the last chance for stargazers to observe this interstellar object before it exits the solar system.</p>

<p>The comet's imminent departure is significant as it represents a rare visitor from another star system. Authorities from the Virtual Telescope Project have arranged the live feed, titled 'Farewell, 3I/ATLAS: a final view of this exceptional object,' which will provide real-time views of the comet using robotic telescopes. Earth will be positioned between the sun and the comet, offering optimal viewing conditions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> January 22, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Time:</strong> 11:30 p.m. GMT (6:30 p.m. EST)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Livestream by the Virtual Telescope Project</li>
    <li><strong>Comet designation:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Previous names:</strong> A11pl3Z, C/2025 N1 ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025, using a remote telescope in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile, as part of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System project. Initially tagged as A11pl3Z, it was later renamed C/2025 N1 ATLAS upon exhibiting comet-like behavior. Its trajectory indicated it was on a hyperbolic path, confirming its origin from a different star system.</p>

<p>In 2023, the comet's arrival led to speculation about its nature, with some suggesting it could be an alien craft. However, evidence collected by NASA and ESA pointed to its natural origins, with outgassing characteristics typical of comets.</p>

<p>As the comet nears the end of its journey, the livestream event on January 22 represents the final chance for enthusiasts to observe it before it fades into the cosmos.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is truly the last call for observation. Once it fades from view after this final appearance, 3I/ATLAS will never be seen again,” said a representative from the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed to have passed through our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The trajectory and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have contributed to discussions about the nature of interstellar visitors and their implications for understanding the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After the livestream, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey back to the interstellar medium. Observers will not have another opportunity to view the comet as it exits the solar system.</p>
