      <h2>NASA shares different views of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas as scientists study the object using various space cameras and observatories</h2>

<p>NASA has shared new images and updates about comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object currently passing through our solar system. Discovered on July 1, 2023, by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, this comet is unique as it originates from outside our solar system, making it only the third known interstellar object.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it offers scientists a rare opportunity to study an object that has traveled from another star system. NASA is utilizing multiple spacecraft and telescopes to observe 3I/Atlas, with twelve missions having already captured images of the comet. As it continues its journey, more missions will also have the opportunity to observe it.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet passed Mars at a distance of approximately 19 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured some of the closest images of the comet.</li>
    <li>NASA's MAVEN orbiter took ultraviolet pictures of the comet.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will fly closest to Earth on December 19, 2023, at about 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA plans to continue observing the comet as it moves past Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, NASA began monitoring the comet using various missions. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured close images as the comet approached Mars in the fall. From September 11 to October 2, the STEREO mission tracked the comet near the Sun, followed by the SOHO mission observing it from October 15 to October 26. The Psyche and Lucy missions also photographed the comet during their asteroid studies in September.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By examining 3I/Atlas from various angles, NASA aims to understand how it differs from the comets that formed in our own solar system,” NASA officials said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar object observed, following the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such objects is crucial as it can provide insights into the formation and evolution of other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth and moves past Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026, with additional observations planned from various missions.</p>
