      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS: NASA Telescope Sees It Leaving the Solar System</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, considered a comet by most astronomers, was discovered in early July 2025 and is currently departing the Solar System after reaching its closest point to the Sun in late October and to Earth in December. The comet is now heading towards Jupiter.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides scientists with valuable data that may help uncover the mysteries surrounding this unusual object. NASA's TESS space telescope has captured its movement, and researchers aim to analyze the data to understand the comet's activity, including how much dust and gas it is shedding into space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest point to the Sun: Late October 2025</li>
    <li>Closest point to Earth: December 2025</li>
    <li>Current trajectory: Heading towards Jupiter</li>
    <li>TESS observations: January 15 to 22, 2026</li>
    <li>Brightness magnitude: 11.5</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in early July 2025. It reached its closest distance to the Sun in late October and then to Earth in December. The TESS space telescope tracked the comet from January 15 to 22, 2026, as it was moving away from the Solar System. Observations were temporarily interrupted when TESS entered safe mode due to a solar panel issue.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The data obtained may help uncover some mysteries of this enigmatic interstellar object,” scientists stated. “We want to study the comet's activity, which will help us understand how intensely it is shedding dust and gas into space.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has attracted attention due to its unusual chemical composition and trajectory, which differs from known comets. Some scientists have speculated that it might be a spacecraft from an extraterrestrial civilization; however, most astronomers, including those from NASA, maintain that it is a comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected by TESS to further study the comet's characteristics and behavior as it leaves the Solar System.</p>
