      <h2>Nasa unveils close-ups of rare interstellar comet 3I/Atlas on brief solar system visit</h2>

<p>On November 20, 2025, Nasa released detailed images of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which has made a brief pass through the solar system. The comet approached Mars last month, passing at a distance of approximately 18 million miles (29 million kilometres) without incident.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed visitor from another star system. Nasa scientists believe the comet may provide insights into conditions predating the formation of the Sun and Earth. Authorities are conducting additional observations, including from the James Webb Space Telescope, to gather more data on this unique celestial object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/Atlas passed Mars on October 22, 2025.</li>
<li>The comet is now about 190 million miles (307 million kilometres) from Earth.</li>
<li>The nearest approach to Earth is anticipated in mid-December at approximately 167 million miles (269 million kilometres).</li>
<li>Three Nasa spacecraft captured images during the fly-by.</li>
<li>Two European Space Agency satellites also collected data on the comet.</li>
<li>Measurements from ESA’s Juice probe will not be received until February 2026.</li>
<li>The comet spans between approximately 440 metres (1,444 feet) and 5.6 kilometres (3.5 miles) across.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in the summer of 2025. On October 22, 2025, it made its closest approach to Mars, where Nasa and ESA spacecraft recorded its passage. Following this, the comet has continued its outbound trajectory, and ground-based astronomers have begun to capture additional imagery.</p>
<p>The next significant event is its anticipated closest approach to Earth in mid-December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa has stated that while there is heightened public interest in the comet, it is "unequivocally a comet on a one-off passage through our neighbourhood," dismissing speculative claims that it may be an alien craft.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is notable as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such objects provides valuable data on the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas over the coming weeks, with additional observations planned from various space and ground-based telescopes. The next set of data from the Juice probe is expected in February 2026.</p>
