      <h2>3I ATLAS Interstellar Comet Tail Mystery Prompts Upcoming Space Missions</h2>

<p>Scientists are closely observing comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the Solar System, with the Hera spacecraft and Europa Clipper mission set to fly through its tail between October 25 and November 6, 2025. This marks a significant opportunity to study the comet’s composition and behavior as it approaches its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This research is crucial as it may provide insights into the structure and magnetic field interactions of interstellar objects. The upcoming flybys of Hera and Europa Clipper will allow scientists to gather data on the comet's emissions and mass loss, contributing to the understanding of 3I ATLAS and its similarities to other known interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
    <li>Hera will pass through the comet's tail at a distance of 8 million kilometers between October 25 and November 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper will pass at 8.2 million kilometers from October 30 to November 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has emitted significant amounts of water and hydroxyl ions, affecting the magnetic field in the Solar System.</li>
    <li>From July to October 2025, 3I/ATLAS lost approximately 2 million tons of material.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing a jet-like anti-tail structure. By September 2025, this anti-tail transitioned into a regular tail as the comet approached the Sun. Observations indicated that carbon dioxide is a primary driver of the comet's activity, comprising about 87% of its emissions.</p>
<p>As of October 2025, the comet is near the Sun, making Earth-based observations impossible. The Hera spacecraft and Europa Clipper are preparing to gather data during their respective flybys, providing a unique chance to study the comet's tail and its interactions with solar wind.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is the first time humans will have the chance to directly sample an interstellar comet tail,” said a spokesperson for the Hera mission.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets has gained importance in recent years, particularly since the discovery of 3I/ATLAS. Previous interstellar objects like ‘Oumuamua and Borisov have raised questions about the differences between natural and artificial celestial bodies. The upcoming missions aim to clarify these distinctions and enhance understanding of such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations will continue as Hera and Europa Clipper conduct their flybys. Observations in December 2025, when 3I/ATLAS will be closest to Earth, are expected to provide further insights into the comet's behavior and characteristics. Scientists hope to determine whether it exhibits typical comet behavior or reveals unusual features.</p>
