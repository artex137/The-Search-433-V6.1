      <p class="byline">Published 2026-02-03 18:37 UTC</p>

      <h2>Harvard Astrophysicist Decodes Latest Data From NASA on Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has analyzed new data from NASA's Webb telescope regarding comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first observed by the ATLAS observatory on July 1, 2025. The comet, known for its unusual behavior, has sparked discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>The significance of Loeb's findings lies in the composition of the gases emitted by 3I/ATLAS, which include water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane. The data, shared ahead of the comet's perihelion on October 29, 2025, has led to questions about the comet's origins and its potential for harboring life. Researchers continue to investigate the comet's anomalies and their implications for understanding life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet flew past Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 AU (270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has published 18 papers on the anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The comet's perihelion event is scheduled for October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Data from the Webb telescope indicates the presence of methane, water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide in the comet's plume.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS observatory first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Subsequent observations revealed its peculiar characteristics, leading Avi Loeb to publish various papers discussing its anomalies. The comet is set to reach its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025. On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS passed Earth, providing opportunities for astrophotographers to capture images of the comet.</p>

<p>Following this close encounter, data from observatories, including the Webb telescope, has revealed unprecedented findings about the comet's composition. Notably, the delayed detection of methane production has raised questions about its potential origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The most notable finding from the latest SPHEREx and Webb data is the robust spectroscopic detection of methane (CH₄) production."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further questioned, "Could it be that the detected methane is produced by lifeforms?"</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The peculiar behavior of 3I/ATLAS has drawn attention from scientists and researchers, particularly regarding its potential implications for understanding life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS, particularly following its perihelion event, to better understand its composition and the implications for the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
