      <h2>Scientists claiming 'alien ship' is headed to Earth only said so for a bit of 'fun'</h2>

<p>A mysterious object, referred to as 3I/ATLAS, which some believed was an "alien spaceship" heading toward Earth, has been confirmed by scientists to be an interstellar comet. The speculation began after a paper by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb and two British researchers, published recently, sparked widespread interest online.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention due to the public's fascination with the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, have since clarified that the object poses no threat to Earth and is simply a comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object identified as 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Spotted on July 1.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency confirmed its status as an interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>Speculation about its nature began following a paper titled “Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?”</li>
    <li>Authors of the paper stated the discussion was meant to be “fun” and not serious.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The speculation around 3I/ATLAS began with the publication of a paper by Avi Loeb and two British researchers. This paper proposed the idea of the object being alien technology, which led to heightened interest on social media platforms. Following this, NASA confirmed on July 1 that the object is an interstellar comet and poses no danger to Earth.</p>

<p>The authors clarified that their exploration of the topic was intended as a thought experiment rather than a serious claim. The scenario of the comet being capable of slingshot maneuvers toward Earth was purely hypothetical.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb and the co-authors of the paper stated they thought it would be “fun” to explore the idea of 3I/ATLAS as alien technology.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not a threat and is simply an interstellar comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a similar situation in 2017 when the interstellar object known as “Oumuamua” passed through our solar system. Loeb previously suggested checking for radio signals from it, maintaining an interest in the possibility of alien technology in space.</p>

<p>The current situation highlights how quickly speculation can escalate on social media, often leading to public concern without scientific basis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No further investigations are planned regarding 3I/ATLAS. NASA and the European Space Agency will continue to monitor the object as part of their ongoing observation of interstellar comets.</p>
