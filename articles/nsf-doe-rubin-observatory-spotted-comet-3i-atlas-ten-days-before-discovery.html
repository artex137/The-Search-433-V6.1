      <h2>NSF–DOE Rubin Observatory Spotted Comet 3I/ATLAS Ten Days Before Discovery</h2>

<p>The NSF–DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory has detected the interstellar object known as comet 3I/ATLAS on 21 June 2025, ten days before it was officially reported by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on 1 July 2025. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it highlights the capabilities of the Rubin Observatory, which is preparing to launch a ten-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The observations of comet 3I/ATLAS demonstrate the facility's potential to uncover many interstellar objects that pass through our Solar System, which are typically difficult to capture.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on 21 June 2025.</li>
    <li>Official discovery reported by ATLAS occurred on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations continued until 20 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The Rubin Observatory utilized a 3200-megapixel LSST Camera.</li>
    <li>Rubin collected nearly 100 exposures of the comet.</li>
    <li>Rubin's LSST mission is set to begin later in 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 21 June 2025, the NSF–DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory captured high-resolution data of comet 3I/ATLAS as part of its commissioning phase. The observatory was not initially aware of the interstellar object's presence. Following the first alert from ATLAS on 1 July 2025, a review of the camera’s data confirmed that Rubin had observed the comet ten days prior.</p>

<p>Rubin continued to monitor 3I/ATLAS until 20 July 2025, when the comet became unobservable due to the Sun's position. The extensive data collected during this period provided a time-lapse of the comet's movement across the sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This detection showcases the Rubin Observatory's unparalleled field of view and light-collecting power,” said C. Chandler from the University of Washington, who contributed to the image processing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The astronomical community is eagerly awaiting the LSST, as it will allow for the detection of millions of changes in the sky every night,” noted M. Zamani from NSF NOIRLab.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever discovered. Interstellar comets are rare and typically difficult to observe, as they are only visible when they are close and bright enough. The upcoming LSST mission is expected to significantly enhance our ability to detect such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Rubin Observatory will officially commence its LSST mission later in 2025, aiming to uncover a large number of new interstellar objects and changes in the night sky.</p>
