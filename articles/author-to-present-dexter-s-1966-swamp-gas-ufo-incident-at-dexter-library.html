      <h2>Author to Present Dexter’s 1966 ‘Swamp Gas’ UFO Incident at Dexter Library</h2>

<p>Author Raymond Szymanski will present new witness testimony related to the March 1966 “Swamp Gas” UFO sightings during events scheduled for March 20 and 21, 2026, at the Dexter District Library. The presentations coincide with the 60th anniversary of the widely publicized sightings in Washtenaw County.</p>

<p>The March 1966 incidents involved multiple reports of unexplained lights and objects in the sky over Washtenaw County, including areas near Dexter and Ann Arbor. The events prompted an investigation by the U.S. Air Force’s Project Blue Book and drew national media attention. Szymanski has spent several years interviewing individuals who reported witnessing unusual aerial phenomena during that time.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 1966, residents of Washtenaw County began reporting unexplained light sightings, particularly near Dexter and Ann Arbor. The reports attracted significant media coverage and led to an investigation by the U.S. Air Force’s Project Blue Book. Astronomer J. Allen Hynek suggested that some sightings could be attributed to ignited marsh gas, a statement that resulted in criticism and the nickname “Swamp Gas” for the incidents.</p>

<p>In 2026, Raymond Szymanski has organized presentations to share new witness testimonies and recorded interviews with individuals who experienced these events. These presentations aim to document the personal experiences connected to the 1966 sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I have spent the past several years identifying and interviewing individuals who reported witnessing unusual aerial phenomena during that time,” said Szymanski. “Witnesses include siblings who reported seeing an object land on their lawn and residents who described a large craft hovering over treetops.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 1966 “Swamp Gas” UFO sightings have remained a topic of interest in UFO studies and local history. The incidents have been referenced in discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena and have contributed to ongoing interest in government investigations into such reports.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the Dexter presentations, Szymanski will continue to share findings at various UFO-related events, including a keynote address at the MUFON conference in May and a panel discussion in Kentucky in August.</p>
