      <h2>Calculated encounter with Jupiter in 2026 exposes the anomalies of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>An interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS is on a trajectory towards Jupiter, with a calculated encounter set for March 16, 2026. Discovered in 2025, 3I/ATLAS exhibits characteristics that deviate significantly from known celestial bodies, raising questions about its nature and origin.</p>

<p>This upcoming encounter is significant for astronomers as 3I/ATLAS’s mass and acceleration challenge existing models of interstellar objects. NASA has intensified planetary defense measures in response to the peculiarities observed in this comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2025 and is expected to reach its closest point to Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The object’s nucleus mass is estimated to be up to a million times greater than 1I/’Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass within 53.445 million kilometers of Jupiter, close to the planet’s Hill radius of 53.502 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Observations from July to November 2025 indicated an anomalous acceleration not solely explained by gravity.</li>
    <li>A jet of luminous material has been observed being expelled from the object, suggesting a controlled propulsion mechanism.</li>
    <li>Spectroscopic analysis has detected an unusually high nickel-to-iron ratio, differing from typical comet compositions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object with an unusual trajectory. Observations from various observatories confirmed its significant mass and anomalous acceleration between July and November. The object is set to reach its closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, a significant event for further study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The characteristics of 3I/ATLAS challenge our understanding of interstellar objects and may indicate a more complex nature than previously thought,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discoveries of two other interstellar objects, 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have also raised questions about the frequency and nature of such bodies entering the solar system. The statistical rarity of large interstellar objects suggests that their presence may not be coincidental.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and characteristics. NASA's planetary defense efforts will remain heightened in anticipation of the encounter, with further analyses planned after the event.</p>
