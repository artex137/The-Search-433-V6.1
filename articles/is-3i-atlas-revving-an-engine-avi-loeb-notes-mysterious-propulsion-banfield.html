      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS revving an engine? Avi Loeb notes mysterious propulsion | Banfield</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has discussed his observations of comet 3I/ATLAS during an appearance on “Banfield,” highlighting its “non-gravitational acceleration.” Loeb suggests this acceleration indicates possible propulsion that alters the comet's trajectory. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the nature of interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial technology. Authorities in the scientific community are now examining Loeb's claims and their implications for our understanding of space phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a Harvard astrophysicist.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits “non-gravitational acceleration.”</li>
    <li>Loeb has suggested the presence of propulsion affecting the comet's trajectory.</li>
    <li>Details about the comet's trajectory and characteristics are not disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb's observations of comet 3I/ATLAS have been ongoing since its discovery. His recent comments on “Banfield” have sparked renewed interest in the comet's features and behavior in space.</p>
<p>Loeb has previously expressed his theories regarding the possibility of advanced technology associated with interstellar objects, including 3I/ATLAS. This latest discussion builds on those ideas.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “There was some propulsion that moved it away from its original trajectory.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community has shown increasing interest in interstellar objects since the discovery of 1I/2017 U1, the first known interstellar visitor. This has led to a broader examination of unusual space phenomena and their implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the characteristics of comet 3I/ATLAS are expected as scientists analyze its behavior in space. No specific timelines for these studies have been disclosed.</p>
