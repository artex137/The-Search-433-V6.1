      <h2>NASA tracks comet 3I/ATLAS, third object from outside the Solar System, in safe passage through Mars orbit</h2>

<p>Astronomers from NASA and international institutions have identified comet 3I/ATLAS as the third confirmed interstellar object to cross the Solar System. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, the comet is currently passing through the orbit of Mars without posing any threat to Earth. The closest approach to Earth is estimated at 1.8 astronomical units, equivalent to about 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances global monitoring of celestial bodies and provides insights into interstellar dynamics. NASA has engaged multiple telescopes to study the comet's chemical composition and activity during its journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
<li>Closest approach to Earth: 270 million kilometers</li>
<li>Perihelion date: October 30, 2025</li>
<li>Minimum distance to the Sun: 210 million kilometers</li>
<li>Speed: Up to 221,000 kilometers per hour</li>
<li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2025, at 28 million kilometers</li>
<li>Estimated core diameter: Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first reported on July 1, 2025, with pre-discovery data tracing back to June. Initial observations from the ATLAS telescope confirmed its presence. Further observations on July 2 from the Nordic Optical Telescope indicated cometary activity.</p>
<p>On October 3, 2025, the comet passed near Mars, and by October 30, it reached its closest point to the Sun. Observations from various NASA telescopes have continued to reveal important details about its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I/ATLAS demonstrates the importance of global collaboration in monitoring celestial bodies,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows in the footsteps of earlier interstellar objects, notably 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These discoveries have sparked interest in understanding the origins and characteristics of objects from beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network plans an observation campaign from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, to refine size and composition estimates of 3I/ATLAS. The comet is expected to reappear in December 2025, becoming visible to amateur astronomers.</p>
