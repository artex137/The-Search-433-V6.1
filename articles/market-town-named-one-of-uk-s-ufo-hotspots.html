      <h2>Market town named one of UK's UFO hotspots</h2>

<p>The Herefordshire market town of Leominster has been ranked seventh among the UK's top ten hotspots for UFO sightings, according to a recent report. This ranking is based on per capita data collected from user-reported sightings, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This recognition highlights the prevalence of UFO sightings in Leominster, prompting local authorities and enthusiasts to take note of the phenomenon. The data was compiled from several sources, including the National UFO Reporting Centre (NUFORC) and the Enigma app, which tracks recent sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Leominster ranks seventh out of ten UK UFO hotspots.</li>
    <li>Per capita ranking based on reports per 100,000 residents.</li>
    <li>Leominster recorded 58.5 UFO reports.</li>
    <li>Preston, Lancashire, leads with 60.2 reports per 100,000.</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2023, an orb-shaped object, described as a "swirl," was observed moving across the sky in Leominster. This incident was one of several reported sightings in the town this year.</p>

<p>In June 2023, a resident reported a "diamond shape" hovering before it "zoomed across" the sky. Earlier in January, a large green object was spotted breaking into pieces, described by locals as a "shooting star." This sighting occurred during a Quadrantid meteor shower, although observers noted the meteors typically appear in blue or yellow hues.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I had never seen anything like it before in my life,” a local resident stated on Facebook, referring to the green object sighting.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have been a topic of interest in various regions across the UK, with Leominster now recognized as a significant location for such reports. The methodology used for ranking these hotspots takes into account not just the total number of sightings, but also the population size, giving a clearer view of where residents are more likely to report UFO encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Local authorities and UFO enthusiasts are expected to continue monitoring sightings in Leominster. Further investigations into reported incidents may also take place as interest in the phenomenon grows.</p>
