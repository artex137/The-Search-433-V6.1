      <h2>Anomalous radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS put NASA’s planetary defense on high alert</h2>

<p>The international scientific community has responded to the detection of anomalous radio signals from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, first identified on October 24, 2025. The emissions, detected by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa, have prompted NASA to activate its intensive surveillance protocols through the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO). There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this incident.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it mobilizes astronomers and space agencies worldwide to analyze the nature and origin of the unusual signals. The findings have raised questions about the comet's characteristics and potential interactions, although initial trajectory analyses confirm that 3I/ATLAS poses no risk of collision with Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Signals detected on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Location of detection: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa.</li>
    <li>Signal frequency: 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS surveillance system.</li>
    <li>Comet is the third interstellar object detected in the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers officially identified comet 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS surveillance system. This program, operated by the University of Hawaii and funded by NASA, is designed to detect potential impact threats from asteroids and comets. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope intercepted unusual radio emissions from the comet, leading to a coordinated global observation campaign. NASA's PDCO activated protocols to analyze the signals and mobilize partner observatories for further study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The consistent and focused nature of the emission has raised immediate questions about the physical processes taking place in the object,” said a spokesperson from NASA's PDCO.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is no cause for public alarm; trajectory analyses confirm that comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat of collision with Earth,” emphasized representatives from major space agencies involved in the monitoring.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected traversing the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The unique characteristics of these objects provide valuable data on the formation of other planetary systems. The discovery of anomalous radio signals from 3I/ATLAS has prompted a review of existing planetary defense protocols and the importance of timely detection technologies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its international partners will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, focusing on spectroscopy to determine the comet's chemical composition and behavior. The aim is to uncover any anomalies that could explain the origin of the radio signals. Further analysis and observations are expected as the comet approaches Earth.</p>
