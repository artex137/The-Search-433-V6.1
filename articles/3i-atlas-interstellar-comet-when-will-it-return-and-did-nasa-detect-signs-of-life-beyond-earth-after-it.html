      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet Peaks in Brightness, Expected to Reappear in December 2025</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its peak brightness near the Sun, observed on October 29, 2025. This marks the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, generating significant interest among astronomers and space enthusiasts.</p>

<p>The event is significant as it may provide insights into the origins of life beyond Earth. NASA is actively analyzing data from multiple missions to determine the comet's composition and potential organic compounds. This research could enhance understanding of how life-sustaining molecules form across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS observed at peak brightness on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's PUNCH mission and international spacecraft are monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be 7.6 billion years old.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may measure up to 5.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>NASA predicts reappearance in early December 2025.</li>
    <li>Close pass near Jupiter expected in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in early 2025. On October 29, it reached peak brightness as it neared its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun. Data from the GOES-19 weather satellite and SOHO have shown a significant increase in brightness, nearly tenfold over several days.</p>

<p>NASA researchers have noted that the comet's brightening is a response to solar heating, causing its icy surface to sublimate and release gas and dust. This phenomenon has been described as extraordinary for an interstellar body.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are essentially witnessing material from another star system responding to our Sun for the first time,” said NASA researcher Qicheng Zhang.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant not only for its age but also for its potential to inform scientists about the formation of organic compounds in distant planetary systems. Prior interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have sparked debates about the nature of such celestial bodies, but 3I/ATLAS offers a new opportunity for detailed study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its reappearance in December 2025. The upcoming close pass near Jupiter in March 2026 will provide additional opportunities for observation and comparison with comets from our solar system.</p>
