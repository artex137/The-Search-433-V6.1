      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery: Interstellar Object 'Not Behaving' as it Races Toward Jupiter</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, is exhibiting unusual behavior as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026. The object, designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is shedding material in a manner that defies typical cometary behavior, according to NASA observations.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant because it challenges existing comet science and raises questions about the underlying mechanisms governing the object’s mass loss. Researchers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to gather more data and understand its behavior as it nears the gas giant.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion: October 29 or 30, 2025, at approximately 130 million miles (210 million km) from the sun.</li>
    <li>Inbound velocity: About 44 km/s.</li>
    <li>Outbound trajectory: Retrograde, inclined at about 5° to the ecliptic.</li>
    <li>Close approach to Jupiter: March 2026, at 0.357 AU (about 33 million miles or 53 million km).</li>
    <li>Mass loss: Approximately 10 million kilograms of dust released over a month, with a rate near three kilograms per second.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. It reached perihelion on October 29 or 30, 2025, traveling at speeds of around 152,000 mph (245,000 km/h). Observations from NASA's Parker Solar Probe and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory confirmed ongoing activity, showing a release of dust and gas.</p>
<p>Recent observations from Tenerife, Spain, indicated that the comet is losing material in a controlled manner, contrary to expectations for typical comets. The object is expected to make a close approach to Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unlike any comet we have observed before,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist. “It suggests an underlying mechanism that current models simply do not describe.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous interstellar objects have exhibited different characteristics, making 3I/ATLAS’s behavior particularly intriguing to scientists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, focusing on its mass loss patterns and behavior as it approaches Jupiter. Further data collection is crucial to test existing cometary models against this unusual interstellar object.</p>
