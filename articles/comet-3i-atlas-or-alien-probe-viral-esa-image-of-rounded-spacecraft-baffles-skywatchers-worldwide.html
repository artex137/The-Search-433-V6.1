      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS or Alien Probe? Viral ESA Image of 'Rounded Spacecraft' Baffles Skywatchers Worldwide</h2>

<p>A mysterious video claiming to show the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has gone viral on social media, baffling observers worldwide. The footage, which appears grainy and depicts an elongated structure, has sparked speculation about the object's nature, with some attributing it to a Japanese Space Agency. However, experts are turning to scientific observations to uncover the truth behind this enigmatic object.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) is currently focusing its efforts on studying Comet 3I/ATLAS as it remains hidden from Earth-bound telescopes. The comet, first spotted on 1 July 2025 by an Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, is the third interstellar object ever discovered. As Earth moves away from the comet, it has become completely obscured from view, allowing speculation about its true nature to flourish.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First spotted:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery location:</strong> Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> 30 million km on 3 October</li>
    <li><strong>Observation dates:</strong> 1 to 7 October by ESA's Mars orbiters</li>
    <li><strong>Next observation:</strong> 2 to 25 November by ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>1 July 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is officially discovered by an ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</p>
<p>October 2025: ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter begin observing 3I/ATLAS as it remains obscured from Earth.</p>
<p>3 October 2025: The comet reaches its closest distance to Mars, allowing for detailed observations.</p>
<p>2 to 25 November 2025: ESA's Juice mission will observe 3I/ATLAS, expected to be in a very active state post-closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Juice will be looking towards 3I/ATLAS so soon after the comet's closest approach to the Sun. This timing is critical,” said an ESA representative.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This data will be the most revealing, providing scientific truth to counter the viral 'spacecraft' theories,” the representative added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar object discovered. Its journey through the Solar System has attracted considerable attention from both scientists and the public, especially as it becomes less visible from Earth. The recent viral footage has further fueled interest, prompting ESA to leverage its space missions for scientific insights.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA will continue its observations of 3I/ATLAS with Mars orbiters and the Juice mission. Data collected from these missions will help clarify the comet's composition and behavior, providing a scientific basis to address the current speculation surrounding the object.</p>
