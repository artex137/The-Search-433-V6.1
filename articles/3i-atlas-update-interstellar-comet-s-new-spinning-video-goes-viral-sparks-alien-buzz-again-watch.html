      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Interstellar Comet's New ‘Spinning’ Video Goes Viral, Sparks Alien Buzz Again</h2>

<p>Fresh footage of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has generated significant online interest after amateur astronomers shared clips suggesting a rotating pattern around the object. The videos, which surfaced on November 18 and 21, have prompted discussions about the comet's behavior, but experts urge caution in interpreting the visuals.</p>

<p>The recent videos showcase what appears to be shifting arcs of light and changing dust brightness within the comet's coma. While some viewers speculate about the comet possibly spinning, professional astronomers advise waiting for formal observations to confirm these early visuals. International teams monitoring the comet have reported no verified signs of rapid or abnormal rotation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed between November 12 and 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>New footage was shared on social media on November 18 and 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations were made using telescopes at Mount Abu, among others.</li>
    <li>NASA and other agencies have reported no signs of artificial anomalies.</li>
    <li>Data indicates the comet displays typical cometary characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between November 12 and 15, 2025, scientists at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in India captured new observations of comet 3I/ATLAS. These observations confirmed the presence of a clear coma and expected gas emissions.</p>
<p>On November 18, amateur astronomers shared videos that suggested a rotating structure around the comet. A second round of videos on November 21 further fueled discussions about the comet's behavior.</p>
<p>NASA published new images from several observatories on November 21, asserting that the comet behaves like a standard comet with no indications of being artificial.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It behaves exactly like a comet. We have seen nothing to indicate that it is artificial or unusual,” said Nicola Fox, Associate Administrator at NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“All available data points firmly to a cometary origin,” said Amit Kshatriya, a senior NASA official.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussions surrounding 3I/ATLAS are not new, as previous comments from astronomers have highlighted the potential for misinterpretation of visual data. The comet's coma, a diffuse cloud of gas, can naturally fluctuate, leading to perceived motion when images are aligned. This phenomenon has been observed in other comets as well.</p>
<p>NASA and Indian scientists have consistently reported findings that align with standard cometary behavior, dismissing speculations of extraterrestrial technology or unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS for further observations. Formal analyses are expected to clarify the comet's behavior and confirm its characteristics as a standard comet.
