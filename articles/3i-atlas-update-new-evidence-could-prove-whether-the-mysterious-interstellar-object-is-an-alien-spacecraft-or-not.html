      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: New Evidence Could Prove Whether The Mysterious Interstellar Object Is An Alien Spacecraft Or Not</h2>

<p>Scientists have been investigating the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS since its discovery in July 2025. Recent images and observations have raised questions about its true nature as it approaches Jupiter this spring. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>The investigation is significant as it may clarify whether 3I/ATLAS is a comet or a technologically advanced spacecraft. Researchers are employing a variety of observational tools to gather more data about the object as it travels through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It approached Earth in December 2025.</li>
    <li>It is expected to pass near Jupiter in spring 2026.</li>
    <li>A team from Oxford's astronomy group conducted observations using the Green Bank Telescope on 18 December 2025.</li>
    <li>The telescope did not pick up any signals from 3I/ATLAS at a distance of 170 million miles from Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025. The object drew closer to Earth in December 2025, prompting increased interest from scientists and researchers. Observations continued, with a significant attempt made by the Breakthrough Project on 18 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Is the network of jets associated with pockets of ice on the surface of a natural cometary nucleus, or are they coming from a set of jet thrusters used for navigation of a spacecraft?” 
    <strong>- Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The negative results from the telescope could only rule out specific types of transmissions, particularly those similar to the Earth's radio technology at relatively low levels.” 
    <strong>- Mark Christopher Lee, UFO expert and filmmaker</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of interstellar objects have often led to debates about their origins and characteristics. 3I/ATLAS's unusual behaviour has prompted discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial technology, a topic that has gained traction in recent years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyse data from 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. More observations and studies are planned to determine the object's true nature and to support or refute the theories surrounding its origin.</p>
