      <h2>NASA and ESA Release New Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and the JUICE probe, on December 4, 2025. The images, however, lack detail as the comet approaches its closest flyby of Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as it marks the ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS, which was first discovered on July 1, 2025. Scientists are eager to learn more about this comet, which is the third known interstellar visitor to our solar system. Observatories are working to gather crucial data on the comet's composition and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest flyby of Earth is expected on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images were taken by NASA's Hubble telescope on November 30, 2025, when the comet was approximately 286 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>ESA's JUICE probe captured images of the comet during its active phase.</li>
    <li>Data from the JUICE probe is expected to arrive in February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. On November 30, 2025, NASA's Hubble telescope captured images of the comet as it moved across the sky. ESA's JUICE probe observed the comet in early December during its closest approach. The images show the comet's coma and tails, although they are not high-resolution.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet is known as its coma; a hint of two tails is visible,” ESA stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Hubble tracked the comet as it moved across the sky,” NASA reported, highlighting the streaked background stars in the images.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have generated discussions among scientists regarding its origin and nature. Some theories suggest it could be an extraterrestrial probe, while others view it as a unique icy rock.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data from Hubble and JUICE as it becomes available. The next significant milestone will be the closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, followed by the arrival of more detailed data from the JUICE probe in February 2026.</p>
