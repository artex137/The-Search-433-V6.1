      <h2>Mumbai's First Tesla Cybertruck Looks Like A UFO On Road</h2>

<p>Mumbai has seen its first Tesla Cybertruck on the roads, as a video surfaced on January 14, 2026, showing the unique vehicle driving along the coastal road and Marine Drive. The Cybertruck, which has a registration number from Dubai, is a left-hand-drive model privately imported via a carnet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights the trend of wealthy individuals in India importing the Cybertruck from other countries, despite the vehicle not being officially sold in India. Authorities have noted the use of the carnet system, which allows for the temporary import of vehicles without incurring customs duties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of video release: January 14, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: Coastal road and Marine Drive, Mumbai</li>
    <li>Registration: Dubai</li>
    <li>Cost of Cybertruck: Rs 5 crore (approximately $114,990)</li>
    <li>Owner: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Vehicle specifications: Up to 834 PS power, 0-100 km/h in 2.6 seconds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 14, 2026, a video showcasing Mumbai's first Tesla Cybertruck was uploaded to YouTube by CS12 Vlogs. The vehicle was seen driving through notable areas in the city, drawing attention for its distinct design.</p>
<p>The Cybertruck has been imported via a carnet, which allows temporary entry into India. This process requires a security deposit based on the vehicle's value, and the car can remain in the country for up to six months.</p>
<p>Prior to this, a diamond merchant from Gujarat had imported the first Cybertruck to India, and a real estate tycoon from Chennai has also registered his own Cybertruck.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The carnet acts like a passport for vehicles, allowing temporary import without customs duties,” an official explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Tesla Cybertruck has gained popularity among wealthy individuals in India, who seek to own unique vehicles not officially available in the local market. The carnet system has facilitated this trend, allowing for imports without the burden of immediate customs fees.</p>
<p>As of now, the Cybertruck remains a rare sight on Indian roads, with only a few having been imported through this method.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The owner of the Cybertruck will need to comply with the carnet regulations, ensuring the vehicle is re-exported within the specified timeframe to avoid additional duties.</p>
