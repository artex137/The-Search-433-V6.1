      <h2>NASA Broadcasts Live Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>This Wednesday, November 19, at 5 p.m. (Brasília time), NASA will host a live broadcast showcasing unprecedented images of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) during its close approach to Mars on October 2 and 3. The event takes place at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, United States. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The broadcast is significant as it marks the first official release of detailed data on 3I/Atlas, the third interstellar object identified, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA experts will present analyses of the comet's characteristics, which have remained unpublished for over 40 days due to a government shutdown that affected NASA operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date and Time:</strong> November 19, 5 p.m. (Brasília time)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland, USA</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Discovery:</strong> July 12, 2025, by the Atlas system in Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Speed:</strong> Exceeds 65 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Core Diameter:</strong> Between 1 and 4 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 28, 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Images captured 80 million kilometers from Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 12, 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/Atlas using the Atlas system in Hawaii. The comet passed close to Mars on October 2 and 3, during which the MRO captured high-resolution images. 3I/Atlas reached perihelion on October 28, approximately 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun. Following its perihelion passage, an increase in brightness and a change in the color of the coma were observed.</p>

<p>After a 43-day government shutdown, the analysis of the captured images resumed, leading to the planned live broadcast on November 19. The raw image files will be made publicly available after the event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The live broadcast will provide insights into the behavior of 3I/Atlas after its closest approach to the Sun,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are excited to share these findings with the public after overcoming the delays due to the government shutdown,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar comet, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirms its origin outside the Solar System. The comet's composition shows high levels of carbon monoxide, contributing to ongoing discussions in the scientific community regarding its nucleus.</p>

<p>The MRO utilized the HiRISE camera to capture the images, which revealed an asymmetric structure in the tail, likely due to jets of material expelled from the core.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the live broadcast, NASA will release the raw image files to the public. Further analyses of the comet’s characteristics will continue as 3I/Atlas heads towards interstellar space, moving definitively away from the Sun.</p>
