      <h2>Is it a comet, or an alien spacecraft? Here's what one Harvard scientist says</h2>

<p>A bright object known as 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth, having been identified by NASA as an interstellar object originating from another planetary system. The object is travelling at a speed of 130,000 miles per hour and is the third such object discovered in the last decade. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this object.</p>

<p>This discovery has prompted significant interest among scientists, particularly at Harvard University. Dr. Abraham "Avi" Loeb, director of the Institute for Theory and Computation at Harvard, has suggested that the object could be more than just a comet, raising the possibility that it might be an alien spacecraft. NASA has been monitoring 3I/ATLAS using multiple telescopes, and the object is expected to pass close to Jupiter, Mars, and the Sun within the next four months, missing Earth by approximately 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: 130,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Identified by: NASA using telescopes, including ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li>Potential size range: as small as the Ted Williams Tunnel in Boston to as large as 14 miles in diameter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, NASA identified 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar object using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Since then, scientists have estimated its size and trajectory. NASA reported that the object is active, indicating it may be a comet.</p>
<p>In late July, an image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope showed the object emitting light, which raised questions about its nature. Dr. Loeb has been vocal about the unusual characteristics of the object, particularly its trajectory and glow.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass by Jupiter, Mars, and the Sun in the coming months, with scientists hoping to gather more data during its approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "We also saw that this object is active, which means that around the nucleus there is some coma, which is an indication that this object is, in fact, a comet," said Davide Farnocchia, a NASA navigation engineer.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "It shows a glow ahead of the object, not behind it. If it were a standard comet, we would expect some dust to be shed off the surface of the object and the dust will be pushed behind the object as a result of the solar radiation pressure," said Dr. Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "As we get more data, when the sun puts more heat on this object, it might reveal its true nature," Dr. Loeb added. "It could be a wake-up call for humanity if we realize that there is a smarter kid on our block."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered in the last decade, following previous objects that have drawn attention from scientists and the public. The unique trajectory and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have sparked discussions about the nature of interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the inner solar system. They aim to capture more detailed images using space telescopes to further investigate its nature and determine whether it is indeed a comet or something else entirely.</p>
