      <h2>Do aliens exist? Obama jokes that they're real – but not at Area 51</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has joked about the existence of aliens during a podcast interview on February 14, 2026, with Brian Tyler Cohen. He denied that extraterrestrial beings are kept at Area 51, a classified U.S. Air Force facility in Nevada.</p>

<p>This discussion comes amid renewed interest in the topic of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), commonly known as UFOs. Recent hearings have sparked debates about the government's transparency regarding these sightings. Nearly half of Americans believe authorities are withholding information about UFOs, according to a prior USA TODAY report.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of interview: February 14, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: Podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen</li>
    <li>Former President Obama confirmed aliens are real but not at Area 51</li>
    <li>Department of War advises most UAP sightings can be identified</li>
    <li>Nearly half of Americans think the government conceals UFO information</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2026, Obama participated in a lightning round during his interview with Cohen. He humorously confirmed the existence of aliens but dismissed the idea that they are stored at Area 51. He also recalled his curiosity about extraterrestrial life when he first took office.</p>

<p>Interest in UFOs has surged in recent years, driven by public hearings and discussions surrounding UAPs. This has led to increased speculation and theories about government secrecy regarding alien life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them," Obama said in response to Cohen's question about aliens. "They’re not being kept at Area 51. There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Obama also stated, “Where are the aliens?” when asked about the first question he wanted answered as president, which drew laughter from the audience.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Aliens and UFOs have long captured the public's imagination, bolstered by pop culture representations and ongoing conspiracy theories. The recent focus on UAPs has prompted various government agencies to investigate and report on these phenomena, though the Department of War maintains that many sightings can be traced back to conventional aircraft or natural occurrences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<pAs the conversation about UAPs continues, further investigations and discussions are expected regarding government transparency and public interest in extraterrestrial life.</p>
