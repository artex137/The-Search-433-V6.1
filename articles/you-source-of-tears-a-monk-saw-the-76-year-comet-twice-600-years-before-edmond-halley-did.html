      <h2>'You source of tears...': A monk saw the 76-year comet TWICE 600 years before Edmond Halley did</h2>

<p>New research has revealed that Eilmer of Malmesbury, an 11th-century English Benedictine monk, was the first person to observe Halley’s Comet, doing so in 989 CE and again in 1066 CE. This finding, documented by chronicler William of Malmesbury, suggests that Eilmer recognized the comet's periodic nature more than 600 years before Edmond Halley made his observations in 1705.</p>

<p>Understanding Eilmer's observations is significant as it challenges the historical narrative surrounding Halley's Comet. Professor Simon Portegies Zwart from Leiden University, along with other astronomers, has highlighted that Eilmer's contributions have largely gone unacknowledged by historians. Their research is published in the book "Dorestad and Everything After. Ports, townscapes & travellers in Europe, 800-1100."</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Eilmer of Malmesbury first observed Halley's Comet in 989 CE.</li>
    <li>He saw the comet again in 1066 CE.</li>
    <li>Edmond Halley observed the comet in 1705.</li>
    <li>The comet's appearance is approximately every 76 years.</li>
    <li>Historical records indicate the comet was visible in China for over two months in 1066.</li>
    <li>Halley's Comet reached peak brightness on 22 April 1066.</li>
    <li>The comet was illustrated on the Bayeux Tapestry.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 989 CE, Eilmer of Malmesbury, a young boy at the time, first observed Halley's Comet. He later saw it again in 1066 CE, recognizing it as the same comet he had seen years earlier.</p>
<p>In 1705, Edmond Halley made his observations and analysis of the comet, establishing its periodic nature based on earlier sightings in 1531, 1607, and 1682.</p>
<p>Halley's prediction of the comet's return in 1758 was confirmed after his death in 1742.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You've come, have you? ... It is long since I saw you... You source of tears to many mothers,” said Eilmer of Malmesbury, as recorded by William of Malmesbury upon the comet's return in 1066.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, comets have been associated with negative omens, such as death and war. Eilmer's observations coincided with significant events in British history, including the reign of King Harold Godwinson in 1066, who ruled for a brief period before his death. Previous sightings of comets were linked to the deaths of kings and calamities.</p>
<p>Research indicates that prior to Eilmer's observations, comets appeared five times over centuries, each linked to turmoil in the British Isles.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research surrounding Eilmer's findings may prompt a reevaluation of historical records regarding Halley's Comet and its impact on society. Further studies may aim to uncover more about Eilmer's life and contributions to astronomy.</p>
