      <h2>China releases rare records of interstellar object made by the Tianwen-1 mission in Mars orbit</h2>

<p>The Administração Espacial Nacional from China has released significant findings from the Tianwen-1 mission, which has been monitoring Mars since the beginning of the decade. During a close pass of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS in October 2025, the probe captured high-resolution images from approximately 29 million kilometers above the Martian surface.</p>

<p>This achievement marks a new milestone in astronomical observation from non-Earth orbital bases. The data collected contributes to the understanding of interstellar objects and showcases the capabilities of China's space exploration initiatives. Authorities are now processing the findings to analyze the physical and chemical properties of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
<li>Distance from Mars during observation: 29 million kilometers</li>
<li>Speed of the comet: 58 kilometers per second</li>
<li>Diameter of the comet's nucleus: 5.6 kilometers</li>
<li>Observation date: October 2025</li>
<li>Data processing location: Beijing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was initially detected by ground-based telescopes in Chile in July 2025. Following its identification, the Tianwen-1 mission successfully reconfigured its systems to capture images during the comet's close pass in October 2025. This involved adjustments to the high-resolution HiRIC camera, which was originally designed for mapping Mars.</p>

<p>The probe transmitted the captured data back to Earth for processing in Beijing, where scientists analyzed the images and spectral data for insights into the comet's structure and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The successful execution of this observation maneuver validates essential protocols for the future of Chinese space exploration,” said a spokesperson from the Administração Espacial Nacional.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader global effort involving multiple space agencies. The Agência Espacial Europeia, NASA, and other agencies contributed to the data collection, enhancing the understanding of the comet's trajectory and composition. This cooperative approach reflects ongoing trends in international collaboration for space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Chinese authorities will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS to refine their understanding of the interstellar object. The findings will also inform future missions, including Tianwen-2, which aims to collect asteroid samples.</p>
