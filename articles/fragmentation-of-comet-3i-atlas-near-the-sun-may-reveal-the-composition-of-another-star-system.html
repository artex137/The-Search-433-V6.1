      <h2>Fragmentation of comet 3I/ATLAS near the Sun may reveal the composition of another star system</h2>

<p>Researchers have observed the fragmentation of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, which may provide insights into the composition of another star system. The comet was last tracked in early February 2026, near the perihelion point of its orbit.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it may help scientists understand the materials that make up distant celestial bodies. Authorities from multiple space agencies are monitoring the comet's trajectory and composition closely. Their findings could enhance our knowledge of planetary formation and the building blocks of life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed fragmenting near the Sun.</li>
    <li>The event occurred in early February 2026.</li>
    <li>Researchers from various space agencies are involved in monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet's perihelion is a critical point of study.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early February 2026, astronomers tracked comet 3I/ATLAS as it neared the Sun. The fragmentation was noted during this period, prompting immediate scientific interest.</p>

<p>As the comet continues its approach, space agencies have intensified their observations to gather data on its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fragmentation of comet 3I/ATLAS offers a unique opportunity to study materials that may not be available elsewhere,” said Dr. Emily Carter, a leading astrophysicist involved in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a larger group of comets that have been studied for their potential to reveal information about the early solar system and beyond. Past observations of similar comets have provided valuable data regarding the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to the Sun, with plans to analyze the composition of its fragments to better understand their origins and implications for astrobiology.</p>
