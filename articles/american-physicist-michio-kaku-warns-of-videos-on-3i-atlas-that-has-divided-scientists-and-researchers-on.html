      <h2>American Physicist Michio Kaku Warns of Deepfake Videos on Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku has warned about AI-generated deepfake videos that exploit his image to spread false claims regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Kaku issued the warning this week via Twitter, stating that the fraudulent clips misrepresent his views on the comet's nature and have intensified public confusion surrounding a contentious scientific debate.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights the growing issue of misinformation in scientific discourse, particularly related to 3I/ATLAS, which is the third confirmed object detected entering our solar system from interstellar space. Kaku has called on technology platforms and AI leaders to take immediate action against the unauthorized use of his likeness.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Who:</strong> Michio Kaku, theoretical physicist</li>
    <li><strong>What:</strong> Warning about deepfake videos misrepresenting his views</li>
    <li><strong>When:</strong> This week</li>
    <li><strong>Where:</strong> Social media platforms, including YouTube and TikTok</li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Response:</strong> Calls for immediate action from tech platforms</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>This week, Michio Kaku tweeted about the rise of fraudulent deepfake videos using his likeness. He expressed concern over the spread of misinformation regarding 3I/ATLAS, specifically false claims that he believes the comet is an alien spacecraft. The videos manipulate footage from his actual interviews.</p>
<p>In response to the misinformation, Kaku urged technology platforms to act swiftly against the unauthorized content. The scientific community remains divided on the nature of 3I/ATLAS, with some theorists suggesting it could represent alien technology, despite prevailing evidence supporting its classification as a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"There has been a sudden rise of fraudulent unauthorised deep fake AI videos, impersonating me, misleading the public with crazy false claims that are not my own," Kaku tweeted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention, particularly from theorists like Avi Loeb, who have suggested that the object may represent alien technology. However, the majority of astronomers assert that 3I/ATLAS is a natural object that demonstrates typical cometary characteristics, including the ejection of water vapor.</p>
<p>In addition to Kaku, physicist Brian Cox has also reported similar deepfake videos using his image. Both scientists have criticized platforms like YouTube and TikTok for their slow response in removing misleading content.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and tech platforms are expected to face increasing pressure to address the issue of deepfake videos and misinformation. Kaku and other scientists continue to advocate for quicker content removal to prevent further public confusion regarding 3I/ATLAS.</p>
