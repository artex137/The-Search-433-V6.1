      <h2>Robots on Mars have just seen the strange deep-space comet tracing across the Martian sky</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed close to Mars, as observed by the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express spacecraft between October 1 and October 7, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides a rare glimpse of an interstellar comet that is not easily visible from Earth due to solar glare. The spacecraft have captured images of 3I/ATLAS, which is believed to be one of the oldest comets ever observed, possibly around 7 billion years old. This data will help astronomers understand its composition and behaviour as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed approximately 30 million km from Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express conducted observations between October 1 and October 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar comets.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus and coma are difficult to distinguish in the images due to their faintness.</li>
    <li>Further analysis of Mars Express images is ongoing, as they initially did not show 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>ESA plans to utilize the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) mission for additional observations in November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. As it approached the Sun, astronomers began to observe it using powerful telescopes. Between October 1 and October 7, 2025, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express spacecraft attempted to capture images of the comet as it passed close to Mars. On October 3, 2025, the comet was approximately 30 million km away from the Martian orbiters.</p>

<p>Initial images from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter showed 3I/ATLAS as a white dot in the Martian sky. Mars Express, however, did not capture the comet due to its camera's short light-gathering limit. ESA scientists are currently processing data from both spacecraft to learn more about the comet's composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target," said Nick Thomas, Principal Investigator of CaSSIS.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one," said Colin Wilson, Mars Express and ExoMars project scientist at ESA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of the few interstellar comets discovered in our Solar System. Its origin from a different star system provides unique opportunities for scientists to study the materials and processes that may differ from those of solar system comets. This observation comes at a time when interest in comet studies has increased, particularly regarding their potential to inform us about the early solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The European Space Agency will continue to analyze data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express over the coming weeks and months. Additionally, the Juice mission will conduct observations of 3I/ATLAS in November 2025, with results expected in February 2026.</p>
