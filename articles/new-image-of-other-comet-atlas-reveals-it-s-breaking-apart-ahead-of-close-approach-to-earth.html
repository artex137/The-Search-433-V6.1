      <h2>New image of 'other comet ATLAS' reveals it's breaking apart ahead of close approach to Earth</h2>

<p>New images show that comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has fragmented after passing its closest point to the sun on October 8, ahead of its close approach to Earth later this month. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This fragmentation matters because it indicates the comet's structural integrity has been compromised, resulting in a cloud of debris streaming into space. Astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) discovered C/2025 K1 in May. It is important to note that this comet is not related to the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, despite both being discovered by the same telescope network.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered in May 2023.</li>
    <li>It passed perihelion, or closest point to the sun, on October 8, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently located in the constellation Leo.</li>
    <li>It will pass closest to Earth on November 25, 2023, at a distance of about 37 million miles (60 million km).</li>
    <li>New observations show the comet has fragmented into several pieces.</li>
    <li>The comet's brightness has changed from greenish to a streaking ribbon of gold.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered in May 2023 by astronomers at ATLAS. It passed its perihelion on October 8, 2023. Observations by astronomer Gianluca Masi in Manciano, Italy, have revealed that the comet has broken apart due to gravitational strain during its orbit around the sun.</p>
<p>The fragmentation was noted after a sudden brightening event around perihelion, which transformed the comet's appearance. As of now, the comet is projected to pass closest to Earth on November 25, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Several parts (sub-nuclei or clouds of debris) are visible, also a plume just below the leading (the first from the left) fragment,” said Gianluca Masi, an astronomer at the Astronomical Observatory of Campo Catino and the founder of The Virtual Telescope Project.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event is significant as it showcases the unpredictable nature of comets. The transformation in the comet's color and structure raises questions about its composition and stability. Past observations of similar comets have often led to insights into their behavior as they approach the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations will continue as C/2025 K1 approaches Earth. Astronomers will monitor its behavior and any further changes in its structure or brightness leading up to its closest approach on November 25, 2023.</p>
