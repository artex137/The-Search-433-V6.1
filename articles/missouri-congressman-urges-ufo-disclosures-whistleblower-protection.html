      <h2>Missouri Congressman Urges UFO Disclosures, Whistleblower Protection</h2>

<p>Republican Missouri Rep. Eric Burlison has spoken in favour of UFO disclosure and whistleblower protections during a conference on January 20, 2023, in Varginha, Brazil. The event commemorated the 30th anniversary of an alleged extraterrestrial encounter, where some claim the Brazilian government captured two “non-human” entities.</p>

<p>Burlison's comments come as part of a push for transparency regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). He has advocated for the UAP Disclosure Act and protections for whistleblowers, stating that these measures will encourage more witnesses to come forward. According to Burlison, “We’ve been given marching orders — we have legislation that we need to pass.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: January 20, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Varginha, Brazil</li>
    <li>Event: 30th anniversary of alleged extraterrestrial encounter</li>
    <li>Legislation proposed: UAP Disclosure Act and whistleblower protections</li>
    <li>Host: Investigative filmmaker James Fox</li>
    <li>Key witness: Physician Italo Venturelli</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 20, 2023, Eric Burlison participated in a conference hosted by James Fox to mark three decades since the alleged Varginha incident. During the event, he expressed his support for legislative measures aimed at improving transparency regarding UAPs and protecting whistleblowers. Witnesses from the 1996 encounter shared their experiences, many of whom had remained silent due to fears of retaliation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is once, in more compelling first-person narratives,” Burlison told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “I’m looking forward to actually getting my hands on any kind of real physical evidence... I remain skeptical until I get my hands on physical evidence.” 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I think that it’s safe to say there’s enough extremely compelling firsthand eyewitness testimony. Something truly extraordinary took place, and we just want an investigation,” Fox stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “In 1996, on Jan. 20, I was called in to see a patient... I realized it was a being not of this planet,” said Italo Venturelli, describing his encounter with the alleged extraterrestrial.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Varginha incident has been a focal point in discussions about UAPs since it occurred in 1996. Many witnesses have come forward over the years, but concerns about professional and physical repercussions have often silenced them. The current push for legislation aims to create a safer environment for those with information regarding UAPs to share their experiences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congressman Burlison's advocacy for the UAP Disclosure Act and whistleblower protections is ongoing. The next steps involve gathering support for these legislative measures to ensure that witnesses can come forward without fear of retaliation.</p>
