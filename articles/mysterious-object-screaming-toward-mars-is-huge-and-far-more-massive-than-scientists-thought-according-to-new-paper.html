      <h2>Mysterious Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Approaches Mars</h2>

<p>Astronomers have been monitoring an interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system at high speed. The object, identified as a comet, has been observed for over two months and is expected to come within 1.67 million miles of Mars in just over a week. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Researchers, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have found that 3I/ATLAS contains more carbon dioxide than initially expected and may be much more massive than previously thought. This information could help scientists understand more about the characteristics and origins of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: High speed through the solar system</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 1.67 million miles</li>
    <li>Expected close approach: In just over a week</li>
    <li>Mass estimate: Greater than 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Diameter of nucleus: Larger than 3.1 miles</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects detected: Two (’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation for over two months as it travels through the solar system. Researchers have closely studied its trajectory and composition, leading to recent findings about its mass and the gases it sheds.</p>

<p>In a recent blog post, Loeb reported that the object's "non-gravitational acceleration" is smaller than 49 feet per day squared. This analysis contributed to the new mass estimates and insights into the object's trajectory, which brings it near Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Given the limited reservoir of heavy elements, we should have discovered on the order of a hundred thousand interstellar objects on the 0.1-kilometer scale of 1I/’Oumuamua before finding 3I/ATLAS, yet we only detected two interstellar objects previously,” <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> wrote in his blog post.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The amount of sunlight reflected from the brightest pixel in the HiRISE image will constrain further the nucleus surface area for an assumed albedo value,” <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> stated regarding the upcoming observation opportunities.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a small group of detected interstellar objects. Prior to this, only two others, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have been observed, making 3I/ATLAS a valuable subject for study. These findings could help improve the understanding of interstellar materials and their properties.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to use NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, equipped with the HiRISE camera, to observe 3I/ATLAS during its close approach. This could provide additional data to confirm the object's size and composition.</p>
