      <h2>A City-Sized Green Comet Is Nearing Earth This Week</h2>

<p>Comet Wierzchoś, also known as C/2024 E1, is making its closest approach to Earth this week. The comet, about the size of a small city, was first discovered in March 2024 by Polish astronomer Kacper Wierzchoś at the Mount Lemmon Observatory in Arizona.</p>

<p>This event is significant as astronomers believe Comet Wierzchoś will be expelled from the solar system, becoming an "alien comet," similar to comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet has been observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and has garnered attention for its distinct green color, attributed to the presence of carbon dioxide in its coma.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> Wierzchoś (C/2024 E1)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> February 17, 2024, approximately 94 million miles away</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Discovery:</strong> March 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope Used:</strong> 4.9-foot telescope at Mount Lemmon Observatory</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> Approximately 8.5 miles</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> January 20, 2024, at approximately 52 million miles from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Not visible to the naked eye; observable through telescopes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Wierzchoś was first observed by Kacper Wierzchoś in March 2024. Its perihelion occurred on January 20, 2024, when it was about 52 million miles from the Sun. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on February 17, 2024, at a distance of approximately 94 million miles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This lovely comet is gracing southern skies,” said Ian Griffin, who photographed Comet Wierzchoś from Middlemarch, New Zealand.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Wierzchoś is believed to have originated from the Oort cloud, a vast reservoir for comets at the outer edge of the solar system. It is classified as a hyperbolic comet, meaning it will not return to the Sun after its current approach. Researchers speculate that it may have been traveling towards the Sun for 1 million to 3 million years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet Wierzchoś continues its journey, astronomers will monitor its brightness and trajectory until it exits the solar system. It may take decades or even centuries for the comet to leave the solar system entirely.</p>
