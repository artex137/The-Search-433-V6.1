      <h2>Thousands of Unidentified Submersible Objects Recorded Off U.S. Coasts</h2>

<p>Thousands of Unidentified Submersible Object (USO) sightings have been reported around U.S. waterways, raising concerns among U.S. Navy officials about potential national security threats. The UFO-reporting app Enigma has logged over 9,000 such sightings within 10 miles of U.S. shorelines as of August 2025.</p>

<p>This surge in sightings has prompted high-ranking officials to assess the implications for national security. Enigma, which describes itself as the “largest queryable historical sighting database for global UFO sightings,” claims it has received more than 30,000 reports of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) since its launch in 2022.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enigma has recorded over 9,000 USO sightings near U.S. coasts as of August 2025.</li>
    <li>California has the highest number of reports with 389 sightings, followed by Florida with 306.</li>
    <li>More than 150 reports detail objects entering or hovering above water.</li>
    <li>The app has logged over 30,000 reports of UFOs and UAPs since its inception in 2022.</li>
    <li>High-ranking officials express concerns about these sightings as national security threats.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since the launch of the Enigma app in 2022, the number of reported UFO and USO sightings has grown significantly. As of August 2025, the app has recorded over 30,000 UFO sightings, with a notable increase in reports of USOs in recent months.</p>
<p>In October 2025, reports emerged of strange objects rising from or diving into the ocean without making a splash, prompting further investigation from the U.S. Navy.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering U.S. water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena.”</blockquote>
<p>— Tim Gallaudet, retired Navy Rear Admiral, in a March 2024 report</p>

<blockquote>“That’s one of two things: either that’s something we don’t understand, or our technology is picking up ghosts underwater.”</blockquote>
<p>— Kent Heckenlively, author of “Catastrophic Disclosure: Aliens, The Deep State and The Truth”</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The increase in USO sightings follows a trend of heightened interest in UFO and UAP phenomena. Reports of aerial phenomena have surged in recent years, prompting government agencies to investigate and disclose information about potential threats. The unusual characteristics of these underwater sightings have added a new dimension to the ongoing discussions about unidentified phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to investigate the reports of USOs as concerns about national security grow. Further analysis and potential disclosures from the Department of Defense may follow as more information becomes available.</p>
