      <h2>‘Technology Is Picking Up Ghosts Underwater’: UFO Tracker Shows Thousands Of Objects Hovering Around US Coasts</h2>

<p>Thousands of sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) have been recorded around waterways in the United States, prompting concern among high-ranking officials from the US Navy. The popular UFO-reporting app Enigma has documented these reports, which could pose a national security threat, as of August 2023.</p>

<p>The increase in reported USO sightings has raised alarms about unidentified objects entering U.S. waters. Authorities are currently evaluating the implications of these findings. Enigma, which claims to be the “largest queryable historical sighting database for global UFO sightings,” has reported over 30,000 sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) since its launch in 2022.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enigma has recorded over 30,000 reports of UFOs and UAPs since 2022.</li>
    <li>Over 9,000 USO sightings were reported within 10 miles of U.S. shorelines as of August 2023.</li>
    <li>500 sightings occurred within five miles of the shore.</li>
    <li>California has 389 reported USO sightings; Florida has 306.</li>
    <li>More than 150 reports describe unexplained objects entering or hovering over water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its launch in 2022, Enigma has accumulated significant data on UFO and USO sightings. By August 2023, the app reported over 30,000 sightings worldwide, with a notable concentration of over 9,000 sightings near U.S. waterways.</p>
<p>In March 2024, retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet issued a report expressing concern over the implications of these findings. He indicated that unidentified objects capable of entering water without splashing could have significant consequences.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That’s one of two things: either that’s something we don’t understand, or our technology is picking up ghosts underwater.”</blockquote>
<p>- Kent Heckenlively, author of “Catastrophic Disclosure: Aliens, The Deep State and The Truth.”</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The rise in USO sightings aligns with a growing trend of interest in unidentified aerial phenomena. Previous reports have also indicated a lack of transparency from government agencies regarding these occurrences. The implications for national security and scientific understanding remain unclear.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue monitoring USO sightings and assess their implications for national security. Further investigations may be initiated as more data becomes available.</p>
