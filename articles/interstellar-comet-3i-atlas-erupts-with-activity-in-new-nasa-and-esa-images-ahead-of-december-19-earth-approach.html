      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Erupts with Activity in New NASA and ESA Images Ahead of December 19 Earth Approach</h2>

<p>NASA and ESA have reported that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting increased activity as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach scheduled for December 19, 2025. The comet is currently about 1.8 astronomical units away, approximately 170 million miles (270 million km) from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the comet's transition from an obscure object to a subject of global interest. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet has revealed jets, twin tails, and a mix of organic molecules, which scientists believe are linked to the chemistry that precedes life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is officially designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>It was first reported on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at about 1.4 AU.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured new images of the comet on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Juice spacecraft observed the comet on November 4, 2025, at a distance of 66 million km (41 million miles).</li>
    <li>ALMA reported high levels of methanol and hydrogen cyanide in the comet's atmosphere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 1, 2025: 3I/ATLAS is first reported by the ATLAS survey telescope.</p>
<p>October 30, 2025: The comet makes its closest approach to the Sun, skimming inside Mars's orbit.</p>
<p>November 2, 2025: ESA's Juice spacecraft captures a teaser image of the comet.</p>
<p>November 30, 2025: NASA's Hubble Space Telescope releases new images showing the comet's activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA stresses that the comet poses no threat to our planet,” the agency confirmed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The new post-perihelion image is scientifically crucial for understanding the comet's evolution,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates it originated from interstellar space. Previous observations have allowed scientists to estimate its size between approximately 440 meters and 5.6 km.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS over the coming months to gather more data on its composition and behavior as it recedes into deep space.</p>
