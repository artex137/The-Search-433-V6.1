      <h2>Avi Loeb points out anomaly in comet 3I/ATLAS with Jupiter: orbit aligned with Hill’s radius in 2026</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system, is showing a unique trajectory as it approaches the Solar System, with its orbit aligning closely with Jupiter's Hill's radius in 2026. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's path.</p>

<p>This alignment has attracted significant attention from the scientific community, particularly due to a non-gravitational acceleration anomaly identified by Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard and director of Project Galileo. NASA is coordinating a wide range of observational efforts to gather data on the comet before its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration measured at 5×10<sup>-7</sup> AU/day² during perihelion.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 2:00 pm UTC, at a distance of 1.8 AU.</li>
    <li>Hill’s radius of Jupiter estimated at 53.502 million kilometers for December 2026.</li>
    <li>Initial spectroscopy indicates 4% water by mass and higher nickel levels than iron.</li>
    <li>Telescope observations confirm cometary activity since July 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 2025 by the ATLAS system. Initial observations noted signs of activity in May 2025, captured by TESS images. The comet made close passes to Mars in October 2025 and to Venus shortly thereafter. Its trajectory is set to align closely with Jupiter's Hill's radius in 2026.</p>
<p>NASA has planned extensive observations leading up to December 19, 2025, to study the chemical composition and dynamics of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has noted that the probability of the comet's trajectory aligning with Jupiter’s Hill’s radius is around 1 in 26 thousand, raising questions about the object's nature.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Darryl Seligman, a leader of the initial study, emphasized the classic cometary signatures found in telescopic observations, reinforcing the view of 3I/ATLAS as a natural object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique characteristics, including the high nickel content and low water mass, have sparked discussions about its formation and origin. The comet’s trajectory and composition challenge existing models of interstellar evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue coordinating a vast array of instruments to observe 3I/ATLAS during its close approach. The objective is to conduct detailed spectroscopy to analyze its chemical makeup and gather data that may inform theories about interstellar objects.</p>
