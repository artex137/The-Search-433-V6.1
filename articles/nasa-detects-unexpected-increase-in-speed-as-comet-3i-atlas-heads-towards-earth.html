      <h2>NASA detects unexpected increase in speed as Comet 3I/ATLAS heads towards Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has unexpectedly increased its speed as it moves through the solar system, with its closest approach to Earth expected in six weeks. The comet has reached speeds of 152,000 mph, prompting scientists to investigate the unusual acceleration that cannot be explained solely by the Sun's gravitational pull.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it challenges existing scientific understanding of comet behavior. Authorities, including NASA, are closely monitoring the object and preparing for further observations, particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope aimed at detecting any gas emissions that could explain its unexpected trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has reached speeds of 152,000 mph.</li>
    <li>It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to reach its closest point to Earth in six weeks.</li>
    <li>NASA has observed that the acceleration appears unrelated to the Sun's gravity.</li>
    <li>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has raised questions about the comet's nature.</li>
    <li>The James Webb Space Telescope will attempt to detect any gas emissions in December 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the solar system moving at over 130,000 mph. It reached perihelion on October 29, 2023, and its speed increased to 152,000 mph following this closest approach to the Sun. NASA has noted that this acceleration is not attributable to gravitational forces alone, prompting further investigation into the object's behavior.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches Earth, scientists are observing the object for signs of gas emissions, which are typical for comets. However, 3I/ATLAS has not demonstrated the expected behavior associated with traditional cometary activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “If 3I/ATLAS is not enshrouded in a much more massive gas cloud after perihelion than it had in the months preceding perihelion, then its recent non-gravitational acceleration must have resulted from a different cause than cometary evaporation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unusual compared to typical comets, which usually exhibit gas jets when heated by the Sun. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have also sparked curiosity among scientists regarding their origins and characteristics. The lack of observable gas emissions from 3I/ATLAS has led to speculation about its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other scientific agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to conduct observations in December 2023 to search for any potential gas clouds that could provide insights into the object's unusual acceleration.</p>
