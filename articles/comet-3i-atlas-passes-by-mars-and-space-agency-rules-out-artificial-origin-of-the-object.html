      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas passes by Mars and space agency rules out artificial origin of the object</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that the object known as 3I/Atlas is a comet of interstellar origin after it passed approximately 29 million kilometers from Mars on November 28, 2025. The announcement was made by Amit Kshatriya, associate administrator of NASA, ending weeks of speculation regarding its potential extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<p>The findings are significant as they provide clarity on the nature of 3I/Atlas, which exhibits characteristics typical of natural comets. NASA's instruments have ruled out any signs of artificial origin. The agency has mobilized multiple space missions to observe the comet further, contributing to the understanding of planetary formation in other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: November 28, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: Approximately 29 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet speed: 57 km/s</li>
    <li>Origin: Interstellar</li>
    <li>NASA administrator: Amit Kshatriya</li>
    <li>Instruments used: HiRISE probe, MAVEN mission</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025. It entered the vicinity of Mars and made its closest approach on November 28, 2025. NASA's HiRISE probe captured detailed images of the comet during this time, while the MAVEN mission detected intense hydrogen emissions near the object.</p>
<p>After analyzing the data, NASA confirmed the comet's characteristics, reinforcing its classification as the third recorded interstellar comet. The agency ruled out any signs of artificial origin, concluding that the comet is an active natural body.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The confirmation of 3I/Atlas as a natural comet is an important step in understanding the chemistry of other star systems,” said Amit Kshatriya, associate administrator of NASA.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The unique composition of 3I/Atlas offers new insights into planetary formation processes,” Kshatriya added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The previous objects generated significant scientific discussions due to their unusual characteristics. The study of interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas helps researchers compare the chemistry of our Solar System with that of others.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to analyze data collected from 3I/Atlas and share findings with the scientific community. The ongoing observations will help deepen understanding of the object's origin and its implications for planetary science.</p>
