      <h2>A Researcher Says the First UFO Really Crashed in Italy in 1933. And He Has Evidence.</h2>

<p>An Italian researcher has claimed that the first UFO crash occurred in Lombardy, Italy, on June 13, 1933. Roberto Pinotti, an ufologist, asserts that documents he has reviewed support allegations of a crashed flying saucer, which he says was later recovered by American forces after World War II. The claims have sparked renewed interest in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) among officials and researchers, despite ongoing skepticism from the scientific community.</p>

<p>This assertion matters as it coincides with broader discussions regarding UAPs, including testimonies from former U.S. intelligence officer David Grusch. Grusch has stated that the Italian flying saucer was the first object of its kind obtained by the United States. The House Oversight Committee is planning a hearing to address Grusch’s allegations, highlighting the increasing attention that UAPs are receiving from lawmakers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Alleged UFO crash</li>
    <li>Date: June 13, 1933</li>
    <li>Location: Lombardy, Italy</li>
    <li>Researcher: Roberto Pinotti</li>
    <li>Associated Claims: UFO recovered by U.S. forces post-World War II</li>
    <li>Related Testimony: David Grusch, former U.S. intelligence officer</li>
    <li>Upcoming Hearing: House Oversight Committee</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1996, Roberto Pinotti and his colleague Alfredo Lissoni began investigating the alleged 1933 UFO crash after receiving secret documents about the case. Pinotti recently discussed these findings in an interview with the Daily Mail, linking them to the claims made by David Grusch regarding U.S. government involvement with extraterrestrial crafts.</p>

<p>In May 2023, an independent NASA panel stated that a lack of quality data is hindering UAP research, while the Pentagon released a report identifying images of unidentifiable objects but did not confirm any extraterrestrial origin. As interest in UAPs grows, politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand have called for increased funding for research into these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I thought it was totally nuts, and I thought at first I was being deceived, it was a ruse,” David Grusch said regarding the allegations of recovered alien crafts. “People started to confide in me. Approach me. I have plenty of senior, former, intelligence officers that came to me, many of which I knew almost my whole career, that confided in me that they were part of a program.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Senator Kirsten Gillibrand stated, “With aggression from adversaries on the rise and with incidents like the Chinese spy balloon, it’s critical to our national security that we have strong air domain awareness over our homeland and around U.S. forces operating overseas.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding UAPs has intensified in recent years, with numerous reports and testimonies emerging about unidentified aerial phenomena. The Pentagon's acknowledgment of unidentifiable objects has contributed to a growing interest from both the public and government officials. Despite some claims of recovered alien technology, skepticism remains prevalent, as noted by UFO debunker Mick West.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The House Oversight Committee is set to hold a hearing to further investigate the claims made by David Grusch, while ongoing discussions about funding for UAP research continue in Congress. The outcome of these inquiries may shape future policies regarding the investigation of unidentified phenomena.</p>
