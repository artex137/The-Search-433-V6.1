      <h2>NASA’s Perseverance Rover Spies an Interstellar Visitor Hurtling Through the Solar System</h2>

<p>NASA has announced that its Mars Perseverance rover has potentially spotted a newly discovered interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, in the Martian sky on Saturday. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, flying by at a distance of approximately 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) above the planet's surface. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it marks the third confirmed interstellar object detected passing through the solar system. NASA anticipates that studying 3I/ATLAS will provide insights into the formation of other star systems. The agency had prepared the Perseverance rover to observe the comet during its close approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet flew by at a distance of 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>The comet was first spotted between June 25 and 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The International Astronomical Union confirmed its interstellar origin on July 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will next approach Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) between June 25 and 29, 2023. On July 1, further observations confirmed its presence. The International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center confirmed the object as an interstellar comet on July 2, 2023. NASA had prepared the Perseverance rover to observe the comet's close approach to Mars, which occurred on October 3, 2023.</p>

<p>After its flyby of Mars, the comet will remain hidden from ground-based observatories until December 2023 as it moves behind the Sun. The European Space Agency plans to observe 3I/ATLAS using its Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter satellites.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS offer scientists a rare glimpse into the composition and formation of other star systems beyond our own," NASA stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in the solar system, following previous discoveries that have intrigued scientists about the nature of materials from outside our solar system. Such objects provide critical information about the conditions and materials present in distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency plan to continue monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Observations from Mars rovers and orbiters will aim to capture multiple views of the comet during its brief encounter.</p>
