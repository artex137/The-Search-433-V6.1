      <h2>Nebraska Cop Abduction Claim Sparks Mystery Over Winged Serpent Logo</h2>

<p>Herbert Schirmer, a former police officer, claimed to have experienced an extraordinary event on 3 December 1967, while patrolling Highway 6 near Ashland, Nebraska. During the early morning hours, he reported seeing a glowing disc-shaped craft, a loss of nearly 30 minutes of memory, and a mysterious mark on his neck.</p>

<p>This case has drawn significant attention due to the implications of an alleged alien abduction and the appearance of a winged serpent symbol linked to other UFO reports. Authorities and researchers continue to examine the details of Schirmer's account, which has become one of the most debated UFO cases in American history.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m. on 3 December 1967.</li>
    <li>Location: Highway 6 near Ashland, Nebraska.</li>
    <li>Schirmer reported a gap of 20 to 25 minutes in his memory.</li>
    <li>A red mark appeared on his neck after the incident.</li>
    <li>Hypnosis revealed a claimed encounter with humanoid beings.</li>
    <li>Symbol resembling a winged serpent was drawn by Schirmer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At around 2:30 a.m. on 3 December 1967, Herbert Schirmer was on patrol when he spotted what he initially thought was a disabled vehicle. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was a metallic disc hovering above the ground. After stepping out of his patrol car, he reported that the object descended and began to rotate, after which his memory blanked out.</p>

<p>When Schirmer regained awareness, he found himself back in his patrol car without recollection of how he had returned. He noted a missing time span of approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Later that morning, Schirmer discovered a red mark on his neck that he could not explain.</p>

<p>Initially, Schirmer reported his sighting without mentioning an abduction. However, after investigators showed interest in the memory gap, he underwent hypnosis. Under hypnosis, he recalled being taken aboard the craft by beings he described as humanoid.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I never sought fame and deeply regretted coming forward,” Schirmer said, reflecting on the personal toll the incident took on him.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Schirmer case is notable for its enduring mystery and the recurring appearance of the winged serpent symbol in other UFO reports from various locations and years. Similar symbols have been noted in cases from Latin America in 1969 and Buenos Aires in 1972, suggesting a potential pattern in reported encounters.</p>

<p>Despite skepticism regarding the validity of hypnosis in recovering memories, Schirmer's account has been consistent throughout his life. His story has sparked interest in the psychological implications of such experiences and their impact on individuals.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigators continue to explore the implications of Schirmer's account, and UFO researchers remain interested in the symbolism associated with his claims. Further analysis of similar reports may provide additional insights into the nature of such encounters.</p>
