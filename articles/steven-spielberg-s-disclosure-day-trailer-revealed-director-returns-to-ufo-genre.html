      <h2>Steven Spielberg’s ‘Disclosure Day’ Trailer Revealed: Director Returns to UFO Genre</h2>

<p>Steven Spielberg’s upcoming film, <strong>Disclosure Day</strong>, has released its first trailer, marking the director's return to the UFO genre. The trailer was unveiled by Universal on [date not disclosed] and features a cast that includes Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor, Colman Domingo, Colin Firth, Wyatt Russell, and Eve Hewson. The film was shot in and around New Jersey.</p>

<p>This film is significant as it revives Spielberg's long-standing interest in UFOs, a theme he explored in classics like <strong>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</strong> and <strong>E.T. The Extra Terrestrial</strong>. The marketing campaign has begun with billboards in major cities, including New York and Los Angeles, promoting the tagline “all will be disclosed.” The film is set to premiere in theaters on June 12, 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Film Title:</strong> Disclosure Day</li>
    <li><strong>Director:</strong> Steven Spielberg</li>
    <li><strong>Release Date:</strong> June 12, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Filming Locations:</strong> New Jersey</li>
    <li><strong>Main Cast:</strong> Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor, Colman Domingo, Colin Firth, Wyatt Russell, Eve Hewson</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing Launch:</strong> Billboards in New York and Los Angeles</li>
    <li><strong>Trailer Launch:</strong> Before screenings of James Cameron’s <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Spielberg first entered the UFO genre with <strong>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</strong> in 1977. He continued exploring similar themes in subsequent films like <strong>E.T.</strong> in 1982 and <strong>War of the Worlds</strong> in 2005. Following the success of these films, Spielberg has revisited the subject matter in <strong>Disclosure Day</strong>, which has been kept under wraps more than his previous projects.</p>

<p>The marketing for <strong>Disclosure Day</strong> began with billboards in New York and Los Angeles, signaling the film’s anticipated release. The trailer was released ahead of the screenings of <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>, which opens this week.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“People have a right to know the truth, it belongs to 7 billion people,” Josh O’Connor’s character states in the teaser trailer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another character poses the question, “Why would [God] make such a vast universe, but save it only for us?”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Screenwriter David Koepp declined to confirm whether <strong>Disclosure Day</strong> takes place in the same universe as <strong>Close Encounters</strong>, stating, “Like I’m going to answer that. Sorry Woodward! You’re trying to trick me into confirming something that I don’t want to confirm.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Spielberg's films have long been linked to UFO themes, and the announcement of <strong>Disclosure Day</strong> has reignited conspiracy theories regarding government disclosures about alien life. The film arrives amidst renewed public interest in UFOs, coinciding with congressional hearings on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and the release of the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the release date approaches, further promotional efforts are expected. The film's themes will likely contribute to ongoing discussions about UAPs and extraterrestrial life.</p>
