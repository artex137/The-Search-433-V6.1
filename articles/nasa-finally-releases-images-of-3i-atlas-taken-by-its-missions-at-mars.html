      <h2>NASA Finally Releases Images of 3I/ATLAS Taken by Its Missions at Mars</h2>

<p>NASA has released images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which made its closest flyby to Mars in early October 2025, coming within 30 million km of the planet. The images were captured by three NASA missions: the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) orbiter, and the Perseverance rover. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as they provide some of the closest views of 3I/ATLAS, allowing scientists to better estimate the comet's size and chemical composition. The images became available after the recent government shutdown ended, enabling NASA to share data previously withheld.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed within 30 million km of Mars on October 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images were taken by NASA’s MRO, MAVEN, and Perseverance rover.</li>
    <li>The MRO captured images in visible light on October 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>MAVEN took images in multiple wavelengths from September 27 to October 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Perseverance rover captured images on October 4, 2025.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities reported.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS approached Mars and made its closest flyby on October 2, 2025. During this time, NASA's MRO captured visible light images of the comet. MAVEN collected data in various wavelengths from September 27 to October 7, 2025. The Perseverance rover recorded its observations on October 4, 2025.</p>
<p>The images were released after the conclusion of a government shutdown that had previously restricted NASA's ability to share data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Observations of interstellar objects are still rare enough that we learn something new on every occasion. We’re fortunate that 3I/ATLAS passed this close to Mars,” said Shane Byrne, HiRISE principal investigator at the University of Arizona.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The detections we are seeing are significant, and we have only scraped the surface of our analysis,” said Shannon Curry, MAVEN’s principal investigator at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to visit the Solar System. Previous encounters with interstellar comets have provided valuable data about their origins and compositions. The techniques used to capture images of 3I/ATLAS echo similar methods employed during the observation of comet Siding Spring in 2014.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA scientists will continue to analyze the images and data collected from 3I/ATLAS to gain insights into its size and chemical composition. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 2 astronomical units.</p>
