      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas travels at 57 km/s on a hyperbolic path that confirms its external origin</h2>

<p>A cosmic object identified as comet 3I/Atlas has been confirmed as an interstellar visitor, currently traveling through our Solar System at a speed of 57 kilometers per second. The comet is on a hyperbolic trajectory, which astronomers have established as definitive evidence of its origin from outside our Solar System.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas is significant for the field of astronomy, marking only the third confirmed interstellar object observed within our Solar System. Astronomers aim to gather as much data as possible during its brief passage to enhance understanding of celestial bodies that travel between stars. Observatories worldwide are coordinating efforts to monitor the comet's movements and collect data on its composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is traveling at 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>The comet has a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our Solar System, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Observatories globally are collaborating to monitor its path and collect data.</li>
    <li>Preliminary spectroscopic studies aim to analyze its chemical composition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has been detected in our Solar System as part of ongoing sky scanning programs like ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System). The comet's high speed and hyperbolic trajectory have allowed astronomers to confirm its origin from a distant star system. Observatories have begun detailed monitoring to study its chemical composition during its brief visit.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches the Sun, scientists will analyze light reflected from the comet and emitted by its coma to determine its elemental makeup. This analysis will help establish whether the comet's composition differs from those found in our Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The hyperbolic trajectory is the definitive signature of an interstellar visitor,” a spokesperson from a global observatory stated. “This allows the scientific community to direct resources toward in-depth study during the short observation window.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/Atlas, the first interstellar visitor, ‘Oumuamua, was detected in 2017, sparking debate about its unusual shape and non-gravitational acceleration. The second, 2I/Borisov, was observed in 2019 and allowed for detailed analysis of its composition, revealing significant amounts of carbon monoxide. Each new detection, including 3I/Atlas, contributes to a growing understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its journey through the Solar System, astronomers will conduct further studies to analyze its chemical composition and gather data on its trajectory. This information will aid in understanding the dynamics of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>
