      <h2>Congresswoman’s Demand for NASA’s Secret 3I/ATLAS Images Raises National Pressure for Immediate Release Now That The Government Shutdown Has Ended</h2>

<p>Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has called on NASA to release the HiRISE images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS following the end of the government shutdown on October 31, 2025. The demand comes after weeks of public and scientific anticipation for the release of these images, which were captured on October 2 and 3, 2025, but have remained sealed from public access.</p>

<p>This demand highlights concerns about transparency in scientific data, especially regarding an object that is approaching Earth. Authorities, including Luna, are pressing NASA for immediate action to disclose the images and additional data related to 3I/ATLAS’s trajectory and behavior, particularly as it nears a significant approach window on December 19.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna sent a letter to Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy on October 31, 2025.</li>
    <li>The HiRISE images were taken on October 2 and 3, 2025, during the government shutdown.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed within 30 million kilometers of Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to approach Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Luna has requested data from multiple NASA missions, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Parker Solar Probe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2 and 3, 2025, NASA captured HiRISE images of 3I/ATLAS. This occurred during a government shutdown that limited data releases. Following the shutdown's end, Congresswoman Luna sent a letter to NASA on October 31, demanding the release of these images and related data.</p>

<p>As public interest grows, the scientific community has expressed frustration over the lack of access to critical observational data regarding 3I/ATLAS. The object’s behavior has raised questions, prompting calls for transparency from both Congress and the public.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The world is watching, and withholding the most important observational data in the history of interstellar studies is no longer acceptable,” said Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna in her letter to NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The public is asking for the raw data that allows independent scientists, universities, and global observatories to perform their own analyses,” Luna added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This situation reflects a broader issue of transparency within NASA, particularly regarding significant scientific discoveries. The agency has historically been seen as a leader in scientific openness, but the ongoing secrecy surrounding 3I/ATLAS challenges that reputation.</p>

<p>Previous incidents involving interstellar objects have also raised questions about data sharing and public access to scientific information, especially as the scientific community seeks to understand unusual phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>With the December 19 approach window for 3I/ATLAS approaching, the pressure on NASA to release the HiRISE images and related data is intensifying. The agency's response will determine whether further action is needed from Congress or other governmental authorities to ensure transparency.</p>
