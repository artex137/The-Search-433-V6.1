      <h2>Interstellar spectacle: Fiery encounter looms as 3I/ATLAS races toward Sun’s far side</h2>

<p>A rare celestial visitor, interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, is approaching its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, according to NASA and Live Science. The comet is currently hidden on the far side of the Sun, and as it draws nearer, solar radiation is expected to heat its surface, potentially creating a spectacular display visible from Earth in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>This event matters to astronomers worldwide as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected. Its unique characteristics may provide unprecedented insights into the chemistry of worlds beyond our solar system. Global scientific teams are preparing to capture data as the comet re-emerges from behind the Sun in early November.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach Date:</strong> October 29</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Perihelion:</strong> 1.4 astronomical units (about 210 million kilometers) from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>First Confirmed:</strong> Early July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Objects:</strong> ‘Oumuamua (2017) and Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first confirmed as an interstellar object in early July 2023. It is currently moving toward perihelion, which will occur on October 29. Observations and data collection efforts are set to intensify as the comet approaches and re-emerges from behind the Sun in early November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar object offers a direct sample of material from beyond our solar system. It’s like receiving a message in a bottle from another star,” said a NASA astronomer involved in the observation programme.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it follows the discoveries of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. These interstellar visitors have provided valuable insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems in the Milky Way, highlighting the potential for studying materials from distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, astronomical teams across the globe are preparing to observe and analyze data from the comet. This encounter is expected to yield important findings about interstellar materials and may influence our understanding of cosmic phenomena for years to come.</p>
