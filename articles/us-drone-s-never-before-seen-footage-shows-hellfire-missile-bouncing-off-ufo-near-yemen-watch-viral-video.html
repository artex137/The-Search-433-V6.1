      <h2>US Drone Footage of UFO Sparks Renewed Interest in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena</h2>

<p>A video shown during a US congressional hearing has sparked renewed interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as UFOs. The footage, captured by a US MQ-9 Reaper drone on October 30, 2024, depicts a Hellfire missile bouncing off a mysterious orb-like object over waters near Yemen. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the incident.</p>

<p>This footage, declassified recently, was presented by Representative Eric Burlison during a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on UAPs on September 9, 2025. The video raises critical questions about the nature of the object and its implications for military operations in the region, as US Navy vessels and aircraft have been actively engaged in protecting commercial shipping lanes from Houthi militant attacks.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a US MQ-9 Reaper drone captured footage of an unidentified orb-like object over the waters near Yemen. During a congressional hearing on September 9, 2025, Representative Eric Burlison presented the footage, which shows a Hellfire missile striking the object without any apparent effect. Veteran UAP journalist George Knapp expressed disbelief at the footage, questioning the nature of the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I’m not going to explain it to you; you’ll see exactly what it does,” said Rep. Eric Burlison during the hearing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “And it kept going. What the hell is that?” reacted George Knapp, a veteran UAP journalist.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident occurs amid heightened scrutiny of UAPs and their interactions with military assets. The US military has expressed limited understanding of these phenomena, leading to calls for greater transparency. The hearing featured testimonies from government officials, military veterans, and journalists advocating for increased public access to information regarding UAP encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigations into the nature of the orb-like object and its implications for military operations. The discussion surrounding UAP transparency and military engagement will likely persist as more information is sought by lawmakers and the public.</p>
