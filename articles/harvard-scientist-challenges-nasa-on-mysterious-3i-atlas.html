      <h2>Harvard Scientist Challenges NASA on Mysterious 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has challenged NASA's characterization of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, asserting that it could still be a spacecraft. This debate surfaced following a NASA press briefing on Wednesday, where the agency dismissed theories suggesting that the object is of extraterrestrial origin.</p>

<p>The discussion matters as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and highlights differing opinions within the scientific community. NASA officials have stated that the object behaves like a typical comet, but Loeb argues for a more open-minded approach to its analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of NASA briefing:</strong> Wednesday, date not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Close approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Lead NASA scientist:</strong> Dr. Tom Statler</li>
    <li><strong>Loeb's affiliation:</strong> Harvard University</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During a Wednesday press briefing, NASA scientists discussed the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, stating it behaves like a standard comet. They emphasized the lack of evidence for theories suggesting it is an alien spacecraft.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb responded by challenging this view, suggesting that the object could still be an artificial construct. He pointed to anomalies in mass estimates and jet activity around 3I/ATLAS as evidence worth investigating further.</p>
<p>Loeb indicated that clearer answers could emerge when the object approaches Earth in December 2025, which he referred to as a potential "gift of new interstellar knowledge for the holidays."</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA’s representatives should have emphasized what we do not understand about 3I/ATLAS rather than insist that it is a familiar comet from a new birth environment.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The object may have originated from a very old solar system... that means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it’s a window into the deep past.” - Dr. Tom Statler</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Life is worth living if we allow for the unexpected to surprise us.” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS has garnered significant public interest, amplified by remarks from prominent figures such as Elon Musk. The debate highlights a broader tension between traditional scientific perspectives and more unconventional theories regarding unidentified celestial objects.</p>
<p>NASA's current stance reflects a commitment to empirical evidence, while Loeb advocates for the exploration of possibilities beyond established norms.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, scientists expect to gather more data leading up to its close approach in December 2025. Ongoing discussions in the scientific community will likely shape future research and interpretations of the object.</p>
