      <h2>NASA releases close-up images of interstellar comet making a rare flyby</h2>

<p>NASA has released close-up images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on Wednesday, as it makes a single pass through the solar system. The images were taken from Manciano, Italy, when the comet was approximately 190 million miles from Earth. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system. NASA officials are continuing to monitor the comet's trajectory, which will bring it within about 170 million miles of Earth on December 19. Observations of this rare celestial body provide scientists with a unique opportunity to study material that predates the formation of our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Close-up images were taken at approximately 190 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>It is estimated to be between 440 meters and 5,600 meters across.</li>
    <li>The comet will cross Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.</li>
    <li>Observations from ESA's Juice spacecraft will be available in February 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Early August saw the release of images showing the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, two Mars orbiters captured images of the comet at approximately 18,641,135 miles from Mars. On December 19, the comet will make its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,” said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, NASA's acting astrophysics director.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,” said NASA scientist Tom Statler.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nasa officials have dismissed rumors that the comet might actually be an alien spacecraft.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides insights into the materials from a star system older than our own. This observation aligns with ongoing scientific efforts to understand the origins of our solar system and the materials present in interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, with further observations expected from ESA's Juice spacecraft in February 2024 after it completes its pass near the sun.</p>
