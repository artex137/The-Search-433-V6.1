      <h2>China records comet 3I/ATLAS at 30 million km with Tianwen-1 during passage by Mars</h2>

<p>The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has announced that the Tianwen-1 probe captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on October 3, 2025, at a distance of approximately 30 million kilometers from Mars. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks the third confirmed case of a celestial body originating outside the Solar System. The mission, initially focused on Mars, adapted to study the comet, which provides valuable insights into interstellar objects. Authorities aim to expand knowledge about such comets and their characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: Approximately 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet Age: Estimated at 7.6 billion years</li>
    <li>Probe Speed: Tianwen-1 travels at 86 km/s</li>
    <li>Comet Speed: 3I/ATLAS advances at 58 km/s</li>
    <li>Core Diameter: Estimated to be less than 1 km</li>
    <li>Coma Diameter: Approximately 26,000 by 24,000 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile detected comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2025. On October 3, 2025, Tianwen-1 successfully captured images of the comet as it passed near Mars. Additional observations were conducted by other space agencies, including ESA and NASA, to gather comprehensive data on the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The Tianwen-1 probe has demonstrated its capabilities in tracking faint targets, which is essential for future missions,” a CNSA representative stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows 1I/Ê»Oumuamua, detected in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, identified in 2019. The study of interstellar comets is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its age and chemical composition, differ from more common solar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue, with ESA's JUICE mission planning additional measurements of gaseous emissions. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has also collected spectral data that is pending publication. These efforts will further enhance the understanding of this ancient interstellar object.</p>
