      <h2>NASA goes on alert after interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS emits strange radio signals in space</h2>

<p>The global scientific community has activated response protocols after detecting unusual radio emissions from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on January 7, 2026. The signals, captured by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa, do not resemble any known natural patterns, prompting the mobilization of NASA and other space agencies to investigate the source of these emissions.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it presents a rare opportunity to study an object from another star system. NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) has organized a worldwide observation campaign to analyze the comet's emissions, collaborating with the European Space Agency (ESA) and other international partners. The goal is to determine whether the signals originate from a natural phenomenon or something unprecedented.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS celestial scanning program.</li>
    <li>Unusual radio signals were detected on October 24, 2025, at a frequency of 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The signals have been confirmed to originate from the comet itself, ruling out satellite interference.</li>
    <li>The Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, along with the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes, are involved in ongoing observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS program. Following its identification, the comet's trajectory was calculated, confirming its hyperbolic path through the solar system. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope captured the unusual radio emissions. In response, NASA's PDCO activated high-priority protocols for monitoring the comet. As of January 7, 2026, an international collaborative effort has been launched to study the emissions and gather data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of these radio signals presents an unprecedented scientific opportunity,” said a NASA spokesperson. “We are mobilizing our resources to understand the implications of this phenomenon.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unusual emissions have sparked interest among astronomers and physicists, as they challenge existing knowledge about celestial objects. The ongoing investigation may provide insights into the comet's home star system and the nature of interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to analyze the radio emissions and monitor the comet's trajectory. The investigation aims to determine the source of the signals and whether they indicate a natural phenomenon or a potential technosignature. Further observations will take place until the comet's closest approach in December 2025.</p>
