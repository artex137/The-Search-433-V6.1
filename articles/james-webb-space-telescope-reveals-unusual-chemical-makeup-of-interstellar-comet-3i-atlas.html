      <h2>James Webb Space Telescope reveals 'unusual' chemical makeup of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Scientists have discovered that comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar visitor documented, exhibits an unusual chemical composition, according to a group of international researchers. The comet was first detected on July 1 by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances the understanding of interstellar comets and their origins. Researchers have employed the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to analyze the comet's coma, the vapor cloud surrounding its core, revealing insights that may change the way astronomers view such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2023, by ATLAS in Chile.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object observed, following Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma has an 8-to-1 mixing ratio of carbon dioxide to water, the highest ever observed in a comet.</li>
    <li>This ratio is 16 times greater than expected for an object at this distance from the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Observations of the comet will continue through September 2023 before it moves too close to the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS in Chile. Following its detection, researchers used the JWST's NIRSpec instrument to conduct infrared spectroscopy of the comet. They identified the unusual chemical composition of the coma, indicating a significant presence of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>The research team presented their findings in a draft research paper, highlighting the high mixing ratio of carbon dioxide and water. This discovery has prompted further investigations into the comet's formation and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The data revealed that the coma of 3I/ATLAS is dominated by carbon dioxide, which is unprecedented for a comet at this distance,” said a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Additional observations by JWST and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory could help confirm whether 3I/ATLAS is as unusual as it appears,” the research group stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects, Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, had been documented passing through the solar system. The study of such comets is crucial for understanding the materials present in other star systems and the processes that lead to their formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS using JWST and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory to gather more data on its chemical composition and origins. Observations will resume in December 2023 when the comet is visible again after passing behind the Sun.</p>
