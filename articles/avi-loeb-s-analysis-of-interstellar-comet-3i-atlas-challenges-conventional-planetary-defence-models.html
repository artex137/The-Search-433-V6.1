      <h2>Avi Loeb’s analysis of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS challenges conventional planetary defence models</h2>

<p>On December 29, 2025, astronomers in Cambridge have reported unusual findings regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which appears to exhibit motion and brightness changes that contradict standard gravitational and solar radiation models. These findings arise just as asteroid 99942 Apophis is set to pass Earth in 2029, prompting a reevaluation of planetary defence strategies.</p>

<p>The analysis of 3I/ATLAS underscores the importance of understanding unconventional behaviour in celestial objects, according to researchers. With Apophis approaching, authorities are intensifying efforts to refine detection and response methods to potential threats from space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in Chile on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at roughly 58 kilometres per second.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office states that Apophis poses no impact threat during its 2029 encounter.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is shedding dust at a rate of about 3.3 kilograms per second.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the comet 3I/ATLAS is first identified by the ATLAS survey in Chile. Following its discovery, astronomers have tracked its trajectory using various observational methods.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet makes its closest approach to Earth. Observations reveal non-gravitational accelerations and peculiar brightness variations that challenge existing models of celestial motion.</p>
<p>As 2029 approaches, NASA and other agencies prepare for the close pass of asteroid Apophis, focusing on gathering scientific data during this rare event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar visitors are a new class of objects that still need to be figured out,” said Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The case underscores a critical point: effective planetary defence depends on understanding unconventional, non-textbook behaviour,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS is part of an ongoing discussion about the nature of interstellar objects. Previous encounters with interstellar bodies, such as 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have prompted scientists to rethink how these objects interact with the solar system.</p>
<p>Concerns have also been raised regarding the transparency of space agencies in releasing high-resolution images of such objects, with critics suggesting that limited access hampers independent scrutiny.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA, the European Space Agency, and Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency are planning extensive observation campaigns from late 2028 through April 2029 to collect data on Apophis and further study 3I/ATLAS’s unusual properties.</p>
