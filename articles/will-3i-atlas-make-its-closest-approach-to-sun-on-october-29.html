      <h2>Will 3I/ATLAS make its closest approach to Sun on October 29?</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to the Sun on October 29-30, 2025, reaching a safe distance of approximately 1.4 astronomical units, or about 210 million kilometers. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This approach is significant for astronomers, who are monitoring the comet to gain insights into how materials travel between stars. NASA has confirmed that the comet will not pose a risk to the Sun or Earth, remaining well outside the Sun’s immediate zone of influence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach date: October 29-30, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest distance to the Sun: 1.4 astronomical units (210 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Initial discovery: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Speed: 60 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at discovery: approximately 670 kilometers</li>
    <li>Trajectory: hyperbolic, meaning it did not form within our solar system</li>
    <li>Comet will cross Mars’s orbit before leaving the solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. At that time, it was approximately 670 kilometers from Earth. NASA has indicated that the comet will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29-30, 2025.</p>
<p>Following this approach, the comet will continue on its hyperbolic trajectory, moving at a speed of 60 kilometers per second, and will exit the solar system without returning.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a significant chance to analyze an interstellar comet,” said Professor Darryl Seligman of Michigan State University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS most likely remains a natural body,” emphasized Professor Alvi Loeb of Harvard University, addressing concerns about the comet's nature.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is no risk for 3I/ATLAS hitting the sun,” a NASA representative confirmed.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. Prior to this event, astronomers have had limited access to similar phenomena, making this occasion particularly noteworthy. Speculation surrounding the comet’s nature has included discussions about its potential to be artificial, though leading astronomers have largely dismissed these claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the date of the closest approach approaches, astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to gather data and insights on its trajectory and composition, contributing to the understanding of interstellar materials.
