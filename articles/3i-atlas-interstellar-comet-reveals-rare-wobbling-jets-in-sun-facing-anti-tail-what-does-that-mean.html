      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet Reveals Rare Wobbling Jets In Sun-Facing 'Anti-Tail'</h2>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, passing at a distance of 168 million miles (270 million kilometres). Discovered on July 1, 2025, by astronomer Larry Denneau in Río Hurtado, Chile, this comet has challenged existing knowledge about cosmic bodies with its unique features, including a rare 'anti-tail' that points towards the Sun.</p>

<p>Researchers have observed that the comet's anti-tail, which stretches approximately 620,000 miles (one million kilometres), exhibits a wobbling motion every 7 hours and 45 minutes. This discovery is significant as it offers insights into the behavior of interstellar objects. The comet is currently en route to Jupiter, where it is expected to pass within 33.3 million miles (53.6 million kilometres) on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 168 million miles (270 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached on October 29, 2025, traveling at 152,000 miles per hour (68 kilometres per second).</li>
    <li>Anti-tail length: 620,000 miles (one million kilometres).</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, at a distance of 33.3 million miles (53.6 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>Comet's nucleus estimated to be between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by Larry Denneau using the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile. The comet approached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 130 million miles (210 million kilometres) from the Sun. Observations continued until its closest pass to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet is now moving towards Jupiter, with a close encounter expected on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Characterising jets in 3I thus represents a rare opportunity to investigate the physical behaviour of a pristine body formed in another planetary system,” researchers noted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard, raised concerns about the chemicals present in the comet, calling hydrogen cyanide a “chemical weapon” used in World War I.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the solar system, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. It provides a unique opportunity to study the composition and behavior of an object formed in another star system. The discovery of its anti-tail and wobbling jets adds to the understanding of how interstellar comets differ from those within the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, further observations will be conducted to study its characteristics and potential risks. Scientists will continue to analyze the comet's outgassing materials and their implications for Earth and the solar system.</p>
