      <h2>Why This Old UK McDonald's Was Shaped Like A UFO</h2>

<p>A McDonald's restaurant in rural eastern England has drawn attention for its unique UFO-shaped design. Originally opened in 1990 as a space-themed restaurant named Megatron, it later became a McDonald's in 1993 before closing in 2000. There were no reported injuries or fatalities related to the building.</p>

<p>The structure has gained interest due to its unusual appearance and the story behind it. Local authorities have noted the building's significance in the community, while discussions about preserving such unique architectural designs continue.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Opened in 1990 as Megatron, a space-themed restaurant.</li>
    <li>Transitioned to McDonald's in 1993.</li>
    <li>Closed in 2000 and demolished in 2008.</li>
    <li>Located in rural eastern England.</li>
    <li>Initial concept aimed to create a chain of similar restaurants.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1990, a local businessman launched Megatron, featuring a disc-shaped design and space-themed decor. The restaurant included a mock-up of a spaceship's communications station and offered touchscreen ordering.</p>

<p>In 1992, Megatron closed its doors, and McDonald's took over the location in 1993, introducing its signature branding while retaining some of the futuristic features. Despite its popularity, the restaurant faced challenges, including a lack of natural light and high noise levels.</p>

<p>The McDonald's location ultimately closed in 2000, and the building was demolished in 2008.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The space was dark and gloomy due to the lack of windows,” a former employee told CambridgshireLive.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Megatron restaurant was part of a trend in the 1990s where themed dining experiences were popular. While many such establishments have since closed, a McDonald's in Roswell, New Mexico, continues to carry the space theme forward with its metallic accents and neon lighting.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no plans for a new UFO-themed restaurant in the UK, but discussions about preserving unique architectural designs in the community may continue.</p>
