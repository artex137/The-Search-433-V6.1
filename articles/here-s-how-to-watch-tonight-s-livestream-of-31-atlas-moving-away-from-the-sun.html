      <h2>Here’s how to watch tonight’s livestream of 31/ATLAS moving away from the Sun</h2>

<p>Viewers can watch the livestream of comet 3I/ATLAS moving away from the Sun tonight at 11:15 p.m. ET. The comet, which is the third interstellar object ever to visit the solar system, will be visible in the constellation Virgo, according to the Virtual Telescope Project.</p>

<p>This livestream event, hosted by the Virtual Telescope Project from Manciano, Italy, allows people worldwide to see the comet, which cannot be seen with the naked eye due to its dim brightness of +10.9. The viewing comes as NASA prepares to release high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera, following a delay due to a government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Time:</strong> 11:15 p.m. ET, November 16, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> +10.9 (not visible to the naked eye)</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Type:</strong> 3I/ATLAS, third interstellar object to visit the solar system</li>
    <li><strong>Upcoming Images:</strong> High-resolution images from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been monitored for four months since its discovery. Last month, it approached the Sun, passing close to Jupiter, Venus, and Mars, which raised speculation about its nature.</p>
<p>On November 16, 2025, at 11:15 p.m. ET, the Virtual Telescope Project will livestream views of the comet from Manciano, Italy.</p>
<p>NASA is expected to release the highest resolution images of 3I/ATLAS within the next few days, after a delay caused by a government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Science should have been prioritized over bureaucracy,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. “The truth about the nature of 3I/ATLAS will be revealed by the sharing of data, not by the storyline of gatekeepers.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has prompted various theories about its origin and nature, with some speculating it could be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Notably, Elon Musk expressed concerns about the potential danger posed by such a large comet, suggesting it could "obliterate a continent." These discussions have highlighted the ongoing interest and concern regarding near-Earth objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the livestream, NASA's release of high-resolution images is anticipated soon, which may provide further insights into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
