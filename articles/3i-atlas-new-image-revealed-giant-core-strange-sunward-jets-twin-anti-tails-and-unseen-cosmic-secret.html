      <h2>3I/ATLAS’ New Image Revealed</h2>
<p>A new image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been released by British astronomers Michael Buechner and Frank Niebling, showcasing the comet's complex features. The image was captured on November 9 and reveals intricate jet structures that challenge existing scientific understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>This new observation has sparked renewed interest among astronomers and space enthusiasts. Experts are analyzing the image to understand the comet’s composition, formation, and the forces driving its unusual activity. The findings could provide insights into the nature of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Image taken on November 9, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS measures approximately 269 million kilometres from Earth at its nearest approach.</li>
    <li>Sunward jets extend approximately 0.95 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Tail pointing away from the Sun measures approximately 2.85 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Diameter of 3I/ATLAS estimated to exceed 5 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Mass potentially over 50 billion tons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 9, 2023, British astronomers Michael Buechner and Frank Niebling captured a new image of comet 3I/ATLAS. This observation revealed features that are significantly larger and more complex than those recorded in earlier studies. The discovery has prompted further investigation into the comet's characteristics.</p>

<p>In July 2023, a smaller glowing halo around 3I/ATLAS was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, which has now been dwarfed by the new findings. The scientific community has expressed excitement over the implications of this new data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The sheer scale of these jets makes them impossible to analyse using particle probes on Earth-based satellites,” said Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, highlighting the challenges posed by the comet's features.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The density of its anti-tail jets suggests a much larger and more massive nucleus than previously estimated for interstellar objects,” Loeb added, pointing to the implications for understanding interstellar bodies.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its unique characteristics, which differ from previous interstellar objects like 1I/`Oumuamua. The presence of dual sunward anti-tail jets and the extreme size of its tail structures raise questions about the formation and behaviour of such comets.</p>

<p>Previous observations have mostly focused on smaller interstellar bodies, making 3I/ATLAS a significant subject for ongoing research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study the new image of 3I/ATLAS. Observations from NASA’s Juno spacecraft and ESA’s JUICE spacecraft are planned, with Juno set to observe the comet on March 16, 2026, from a distance of 53 million kilometres.</p>
