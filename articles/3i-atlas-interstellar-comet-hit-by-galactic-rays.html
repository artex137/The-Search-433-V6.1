      <h2>3I/Atlas Interstellar Comet Hit by Galactic Rays</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has become a focal point for astronomers worldwide after new research suggests its unique chemical composition may be the result of billions of years of exposure to galactic cosmic rays. Discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed object to originate beyond our solar system. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it challenges prior assumptions about interstellar comets, which were believed to be untouched samples from other star systems. According to scientists, the radiation may have altered the comet’s outer layers, leading to a crust that is chemically distinct from its interior. Researchers are now closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to understand how cosmic rays affect the chemistry of icy bodies in space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Unique CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O ratio of approximately eight times more CO<sub>2</sub> than H<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
    <li>Galactic cosmic rays may have penetrated up to 20 metres beneath the comet's surface.</li>
    <li>Comet is currently active, releasing gas and dust.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is travelling at speeds high enough to escape the Sun’s gravity.</li>
    <li>Observations are ongoing using both space- and ground-based telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its interstellar origin. In recent months, the James Webb Space Telescope observed its coma, revealing a high ratio of carbon dioxide to water. New research has emerged suggesting that galactic cosmic rays have affected the comet’s chemical structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If the cosmic-ray hypothesis is correct, 3I/ATLAS could force a rethink about what interstellar comets really are,” said a lead researcher on the project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, scientists believed interstellar comets provided pristine samples of material from other star systems. The findings regarding 3I/ATLAS could reshape this understanding, indicating that these objects may have undergone significant chemical transformation due to deep-space exposure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey past the Sun and back into interstellar space, astronomers will monitor changes in gas emissions as the comet's deeper, less-irradiated layers begin to sublimate. These observations will be critical in confirming the galactic cosmic-ray hypothesis.</p>
