      <h2>It's Finally Solved: A Deep Space Radio Signal From Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Just Confirmed What It Really Is</h2>

<p>A deep space radio signal from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been confirmed as a natural phenomenon, according to scientists who observed the comet using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. The signal, recorded in late October 2025, has provided new insights into the comet's composition and behavior as it travels through our solar system.</p>

<p>The detection of the signal is significant as it marks the first confirmed radio signal from an interstellar comet. Researchers assert that it offers critical data for understanding ancient visitors from beyond our solar system. Authorities are now focusing on further studies to learn more about the comet’s origins and its chemical makeup.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Detection of radio signal from 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Observed on October 24, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li><strong>Signal Frequency:</strong> 1665 and 1667 MHz</li>
    <li><strong>Key Researchers:</strong> D.J. Pisano (University of Cape Town), Oleg Smirnov (Rhodes University & SARAO)</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Observations:</strong> Conducted on September 20 and 28, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Speed:</strong> Over 210,000 km/h upon entering the solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025. It entered the solar system at high speed and reached perihelion on October 29, 2025. On October 24, scientists recorded the radio signal while observing the comet for over three hours, leading to the confirmation of its natural origin.</p>
<p>Prior to the radio detection, NASA had noted active water outgassing from the comet in early October. The findings were formally reported in the Astronomer’s Telegram.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a textbook case of a comet interacting with the Sun,” said Dr. Sarah Buchner of SARAO, co-author of the study. “It confirms that 3I/ATLAS is not only natural but behaving in a manner we would expect based on previous comet science.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every observed feature—outgassing, tail formation, spectral signatures—fits well within the physical model of a comet,” said Lorenz Roth, astrophysicist at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet’s trajectory has led to speculation about its origins, with some, including astrophysicist Avi Loeb, suggesting it could be technological. However, the recent findings have provided a clearer understanding of its natural characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue studying 3I/ATLAS, with further observations expected as it approaches Jupiter in 2026. The Juno spacecraft may also conduct a flyby to search for additional emissions, as suggested by Loeb.</p>
