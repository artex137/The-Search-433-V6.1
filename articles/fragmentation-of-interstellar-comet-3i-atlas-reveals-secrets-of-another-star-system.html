      <h2>Fragmentation of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals secrets of another star system</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has begun to fragment as it approaches Sol, with the first signs of disintegration recorded in late October 2025. The comet, which was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope system in Havaí, is currently being monitored by space agencies worldwide.</p>

<p>This fragmentation offers a unique opportunity for scientists to study the composition of a celestial body from another star system. According to researchers, the analysis of the comet's fragments could provide valuable insights into the formation of planets and comets in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently exhibiting signs of fragmentation.</li>
    <li>The first signs of disintegration were recorded at the end of October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its perihelion at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units (about 210 million kilometers) from Sol.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS telescope system in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at a speed exceeding 60 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Observations are being conducted using ground-based telescopes and space observatories, including the Hubble and James Webb telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS telescope system discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. By late October 2025, scientists recorded the first signs of fragmentation as the comet approached its perihelion. This marked the beginning of a series of observations by global space agencies.</p>
<p>The perihelion event occurred at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from Sol, coinciding with a significant increase in the comet's brightness and the formation of a coma.</p>
<p>Currently, a coordinated international observation campaign is in place to monitor the comet's changes and gather data on its disintegration process.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fragmentation of 3I/ATLAS provides a rare opportunity to study the building blocks of other planetary systems,” said a spokesperson from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the latest in a line of interstellar visitors, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Each of these comets has provided unique insights into the diversity of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>
<p>The distinctive hyperbolic trajectory of 3I/ATLAS indicates its origin from a distant star system, traveling through the interstellar medium for millions, if not billions, of years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor the fragmentation of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Sol. Observations will focus on the chemical composition of the fragments and the dynamics of the disintegration process.</p>
