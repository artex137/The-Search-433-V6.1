      <h2>Threat to Earth, speed, age and more: All your questions about interstellar comet 3I/Atlas answered</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, an object first observed on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS Survey Telescope in Chile, has sparked significant interest among astronomers and the public alike. This comet is moving at an extraordinary speed of 60,000 km/second and presents unusual characteristics that have led to speculation about its origins and potential threats.</p>

<p>The comet's unusual trajectory and behaviour have raised concerns among scientists and the public. Authorities and researchers are currently studying the comet closely, utilizing various telescopes, including the James Webb and Hubble, to gather more information about this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>First observed:</strong> July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 60,000 km/second (221,000 km/hr)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated age:</strong> Between 7.6 and 14 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 2025, at a distance of 1.8 AU (273 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Current distance from Earth:</strong> About 3.5 AU (523 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter estimates:</strong> Between 0.32 km and 46 km</li>
    <li><strong>Mass:</strong> Greater than 33 billion tons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected 3I/Atlas using the ATLAS Survey Telescope. Subsequent observations from other telescopes, including NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), revealed that the comet had brightened unexpectedly between May 7 and June 3, 2025. This anomaly raised questions about its composition and behaviour.</p>
<p>As of now, 3I/Atlas is moving through the solar system and is expected to reach perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 30, 2025. It will make its closest approach to Earth in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The brightness of 3I/Atlas increased five times, which is not typical for a comet,” said Matthew Hopkins, lead author of a study on the comet. “Our findings suggest that this object is not behaving like a typical comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is unique not only for its speed and trajectory but also for its potential age, which is older than the solar system itself. This has led to various theories regarding its origins, with some scientists speculating it may be an interstellar object rather than a traditional comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches the inner solar system. Further studies and observations are planned to better understand its composition and trajectory in the coming months.</p>
