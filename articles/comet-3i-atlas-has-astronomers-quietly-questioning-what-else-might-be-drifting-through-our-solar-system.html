      <h2>Comet 3I Atlas has astronomers quietly questioning what else might be drifting through our solar system</h2>

<p>Comet 3I Atlas has been detected passing through our solar system, becoming the third confirmed interstellar object since the discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet was identified during routine sky surveys by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawaii, which observed its unusual trajectory.</p>

<p>This discovery raises significant questions about the frequency of interstellar objects entering our solar system. Astronomers are now concerned about the potential for many more undetected objects, which may pose risks to Earth. Space agencies are responding by enhancing their detection capabilities to better spot these fast-moving visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I Atlas is following a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originated from interstellar space.</li>
    <li>It was detected in 2024 by ATLAS in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>This is the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects include ‘Oumuamua (2017) and comet 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
    <li>Current estimates suggest we only detect a small fraction of interstellar visitors, potentially missing dozens or hundreds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, ‘Oumuamua was the first interstellar object identified. This was followed by comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Comet 3I Atlas was discovered in 2024 during regular sky surveys by ATLAS, marking a significant advancement in the understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re looking at an object that spent billions of years traveling through the void between stars just to give us a brief wave as it passes by,” said Dr. Maria Chen, a planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The scary part isn’t what we found. It’s realizing how easily we could have missed it entirely,” noted Dr. James Rodriguez from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of Comet 3I Atlas highlights a growing trend in the discovery of interstellar objects. As technology improves, astronomers are beginning to recognize that our solar system may not be as isolated as once thought. The limited number of confirmed detections raises concerns about our ability to understand the population of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Space agencies are working to enhance detection systems, with initiatives like the European Space Agency’s Euclid mission and NASA's proposed NEO Surveyor aimed at improving our ability to identify unexpected cosmic visitors.</p>
