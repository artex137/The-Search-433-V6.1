      <h2>3I/ATLAS displays complex jet morphology, live stream scheduled for November 19</h2>

<p>Two independent ground-based observations on November 16 and 17, 2025, have documented the jet morphology of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object. The observations took place in New Mexico, USA, and France, as the object continues to fade after passing perihelion on October 29.</p>

<p>This documentation is significant as it provides insight into the behavior of interstellar objects. Researchers aim to monitor the comet's activity as its brightness diminishes, which limits imaging opportunities. The Virtual Telescope Project has rescheduled a livestream observation for November 19, 2025, to capture any remaining activity of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion was reached on October 29, 2025, at approximately 1.36 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Observations on November 16 were conducted between 11:53 and 12:23 UTC.</li>
    <li>Observations on November 17 occurred at 17:04 UTC.</li>
    <li>The livestream session is scheduled for 04:15 UTC on November 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Public access to the livestream will be available through the Virtual Telescope Project’s online platform.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 16, 2025, Satoru Murata captured a sequence of 24 exposures using a 0.2 m Celestron EdgeHD 800 telescope in New Mexico, USA. The images revealed multiple narrow jets and a pronounced anti-tail.</p>

<p>The following day, Francois Kugel recorded a second sequence using a 0.4 m telescope in France. This observation confirmed the multi-directional jet features noted previously. Both datasets showed stable jet morphology over at least 24 hours.</p>

<p>Due to cloud cover, the Virtual Telescope Project postponed its planned observation session but has since rescheduled it for November 19, 2025. This session will provide one of the last opportunities for real-time monitoring of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The similarity between the two composites indicates stable jet morphology over a period of at least 24 hours,” said Satoru Murata.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Given the object’s rapid decline in brightness, the livestream is expected to offer limited but valuable visual data,” noted the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third confirmed interstellar object, following its discovery by the ATLAS survey. Its hyperbolic trajectory and rapid decline in brightness present unique challenges for observation.</p>

<p>Prior observations of interstellar objects have indicated that their activity can vary significantly, making consistent monitoring critical for understanding their behavior and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Virtual Telescope Project will conduct its livestream session on November 19, 2025, providing public access to the observations of 3I/ATLAS as it continues to fade. Researchers will analyze the data to assess the comet's remaining activity and jet morphology.</p>
