      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Viewing: Can you see the Interstellar object from Earth? Here’s how to spot it tonight</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reappeared in the night sky, drawing attention from astronomers and space enthusiasts. The comet, first detected on July 1, is now moving into a position where it can be observed from Earth after reaching its perihelion on October 30.</p>

<p>The comet's journey through the solar system has sparked significant interest. NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as the third known interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua’ and Comet 2I/Borisov. Researchers are eager to study its unique composition and trajectory, which may provide insights into planetary system formation beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on October 30.</li>
    <li>Currently visible with small to medium-sized telescopes.</li>
    <li>Best viewing times are before dawn in November and December 2025.</li>
    <li>Visible low on the eastern horizon just before sunrise.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, astronomers first detected the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its perihelion on October 30, the comet has begun to move back into a position observable from Earth.</p>
<p>As of early November, astronomers have reported that 3I/ATLAS is now visible through small telescopes, although it remains too faint for the unaided eye.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is easily visible with small telescopes now,” said astronomer Yicheng Zhang in an interview with the New York Post. “A lot of large telescopes can’t point very close to the horizon and therefore can’t observe objects near the Sun during twilight,” he added, explaining earlier claims of invisibility.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is the third interstellar object detected entering our solar system. Unlike comets formed within our solar system, this comet originates from another star system, providing a unique opportunity for scientific study.</p>
<p>NASA scientists are particularly interested in the comet's volatile materials, which may illuminate broader questions about planetary formation across the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its outbound trajectory, astronomers expect the comet to rise higher in the pre-dawn sky, offering more stable viewing opportunities in the coming weeks.</p>
