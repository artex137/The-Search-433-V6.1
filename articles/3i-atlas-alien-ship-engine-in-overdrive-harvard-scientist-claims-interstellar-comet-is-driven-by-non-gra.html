      <h2>3I/ATLAS comet sparks claims of alien technology by Harvard scientist</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has claimed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be driven by a non-gravitational acceleration, possibly due to an internal engine. Loeb made these statements following the comet's perihelion, which occurred on October 30, 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.35 astronomical units from the sun.</p>

<p>This assertion is significant as it raises questions about the origins of the comet, which Loeb has suggested could be alien technology. Loeb has publicly criticized NASA for allegedly withholding critical information regarding the comet, increasing scrutiny on the space agency's handling of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Perihelion:</strong> 1.35 astronomical units (125 million miles or 202 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Research Authors:</strong> Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams</li>
    <li><strong>Loeb's Probability Estimate:</strong> 40% chance the comet is alien technology</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by NASA’s ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, Loeb has made several observations about the comet's unusual characteristics.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2025, the comet reached its perihelion, marking the closest point in its orbit to the sun. Loeb noted that this event coincided with the first evidence of non-gravitational acceleration observed in the comet.</p>
<p>In recent blog posts, Loeb has discussed the comet’s unexpected blue appearance, which he argues contradicts typical comet behavior and could suggest an artificial source of light.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For a natural comet, this blue color is very surprising. Dust is expected to redden the scattered sunlight, and the surface of 3I/ATLAS is expected to be ~20 times colder than the 5,800 degrees Kelvin at the photosphere of the Sun, resulting in it having a redder color than the Sun,” said Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The blue appearance at perihelion is a ninth anomaly in the list of unexpected properties of 3I/ATLAS. It could potentially be explained by a hot engine or a source of artificial light,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS marks it as the third observed interstellar object to enter our solar system. Loeb's claims about the comet's potential extraterrestrial origins have stirred debate within the scientific community and the public.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Loeb has suggested that interstellar objects may have artificial origins, as he has previously raised similar concerns about other celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the properties of 3I/ATLAS are expected as scientists continue to analyze data from its perihelion. The scientific community will likely scrutinize Loeb's claims and the implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>
