      <h2>NASA Detects Building Blocks Of Life On Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A newly observed interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has sparked significant interest after NASA’s SPHEREx spacecraft detected organic chemicals on the object. The findings have prompted discussions among scientists about the potential for the comet to carry the ingredients for life across star systems.</p>

<p>The discovery is important as it raises questions about the origins of life and the processes that may transport biological materials in space. Authorities, including researchers from NASA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, are analyzing the data further to understand the implications of these findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed by NASA’s SPHEREx spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Organic molecules detected include methanol, methane, and cyanide.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently near the Sun, where heat has triggered sublimation.</li>
    <li>Carey Lisse leads the study at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</li>
    <li>No evidence of living organisms has been found on the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA’s SPHEREx spacecraft detected organic molecules on comet 3I/ATLAS as it approached the Sun. The analysis revealed that these compounds are consistent with those expected from early Solar System bodies. The detection of methane has raised questions about its origins, with some researchers suggesting it could indicate the presence of microbial life.</p>

<p>As the comet nears the Sun, heat has caused gases and dust trapped in ice to be released into space. Scientists continue to monitor the comet’s gas emissions to gather more data about its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The materials detected are consistent with what astronomers expect from early Solar System bodies,” said Carey Lisse from Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The presence of methane later in the comet’s activity could mean it was buried deep within the object,” noted Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery contributes to the ongoing discussions about panspermia, the theory that life’s building blocks can travel between star systems on comets or asteroids. While organic molecules are common in space, the findings on 3I/ATLAS have prompted further speculation about the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>Loeb has previously suggested that certain interstellar objects could carry biological material, and he described 3I/ATLAS as a potential “interstellar gardener,” which could spread microbes across planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS and analyze its gas emissions to better understand its composition. Further studies may provide more insights into the origins of life and the processes that allow for the transfer of biological materials in space.</p>
