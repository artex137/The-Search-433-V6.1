      <h2>NASA And SETI Dismiss Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS 'Alien Intruder' Claims in New Paper</h2>

<p>NASA and the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) have dismissed claims that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be an alien probe following a new paper published by AKM Eahsanul Haque on Earth ArXiv. The comet, detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, travels at a record-breaking speed of 137,000 miles per hour and has been classified as the third interstellar visitor to enter the solar system.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights the ongoing debate between scientific communities regarding the nature of interstellar objects. While some researchers advocate for a more open-minded approach, major institutions like NASA maintain that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet until proven otherwise.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Located in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Travels at 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 267 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Paper published by AKM Eahsanul Haque on Earth ArXiv.</li>
    <li>NASA has monitored 3I/ATLAS with 20 different missions.</li>
    <li>SETI's Breakthrough Listen project scanned for technosignatures with no evidence found.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope detected 3I/ATLAS in Rio Hurtado, Chile. Following its discovery, the comet was confirmed to be traveling at an unprecedented speed and on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it would not return. On December 19, 2025, it made its closest approach to Earth, at a distance of approximately 267 million kilometers.</p>

<p>In response to claims about the comet's possible artificial origin, AKM Eahsanul Haque published a paper on Earth ArXiv discussing the object's trajectory and features. NASA and SETI have since conducted extensive monitoring and analysis of 3I/ATLAS, concluding it is a natural geological relic.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for Solar System Small Bodies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Loeb et al. found that the retrograde orbital plane of 3I/ATLAS is quite near to the ecliptic, with a 0.2% likelihood that this alignment is not just a coincidence,” noted AKM Eahsanul Haque in his paper.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflects a broader discourse on the nature of interstellar objects. Previous interstellar visitors, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also sparked speculation about potential artificial origins. The limited number of interstellar objects studied has led to ongoing discussions about what constitutes a 'normal' interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory through the solar system, NASA and SETI will keep monitoring the comet with various instruments. Researchers remain vigilant in their search for further evidence that might clarify the object's origins and characteristics.</p>
