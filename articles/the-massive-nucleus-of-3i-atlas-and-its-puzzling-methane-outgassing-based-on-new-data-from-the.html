      <h2>The Massive Nucleus of 3I/ATLAS and its Puzzling Methane Outgassing</h2>

<p>Researchers have reported new findings about comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a significant nucleus and unusual methane outgassing. The data was presented in a recent study but the specific publication date and location were not disclosed.</p>

<p>This research is important as it could enhance understanding of cometary behavior and the composition of celestial bodies. Authorities in the scientific community are currently analyzing the data to determine its implications for future studies of comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Nucleus size of 3I/ATLAS: not disclosed</li>
    <li>Presence of methane detected: yes</li>
    <li>Research published: not disclosed</li>
    <li>Location of observations: not disclosed</li>
    <li>Involvement of scientists: not disclosed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent observations of comet 3I/ATLAS have led to the discovery of its massive nucleus and methane outgassing. The study's findings have prompted further investigations into the behavior of this comet.</p>

<p>Details surrounding the specific methodologies used in the study have not been disclosed, but the implications of the findings are already being discussed in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of methane outgassing from 3I/ATLAS opens new avenues for understanding the composition and activity of comets,” said a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This finding is part of a broader effort to study comets and their characteristics. Previous studies have indicated that methane may be a common component in the atmospheres of comets, but the extent of its presence in 3I/ATLAS is significant.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are expected to conduct further analyses of the data and share additional findings in the future. The scientific community is closely monitoring developments related to comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>
