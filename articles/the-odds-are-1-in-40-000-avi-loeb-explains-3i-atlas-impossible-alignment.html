      <h2>The Odds Are 1 in 40,000: Avi Loeb Explains 3I/ATLAS' Impossible Alignment</h2>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has proposed a new anomaly regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, stating that its rotation axis points almost directly toward the Sun. Loeb claims the odds of this alignment occurring by chance are just one in 40,000. This discovery adds to the list of peculiarities observed in 3I/ATLAS since it entered the solar system earlier this year.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it challenges existing assumptions about cometary behavior. Loeb suggests that the alignment may indicate that 3I/ATLAS is not merely a natural fragment in space. His analysis raises questions about how scientists should approach anomalies in interstellar research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb estimates the probability of 3I/ATLAS's alignment with the Sun as one in 40,000.</li>
    <li>The object entered the solar system in 2023.</li>
    <li>Loeb's previous work includes research on the interstellar object Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>Loeb has initiated the Galileo Project to investigate evidence of extraterrestrial technology.</li>
    <li>Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope have indicated that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected as it entered the solar system in 2023. Since then, astronomers have observed various anomalies associated with the object. Recently, Avi Loeb identified a significant alignment of the object's rotation axis with the Sun, presenting his findings to the scientific community.</p>

<p>Loeb has previously suggested that unusual behaviors in interstellar objects could point to technological sources. His comments have reignited discussions about the importance of rigorously studying such anomalies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The axis of rotation is randomly distributed in normal comets. In the case of 3I/ATLAS, the axis is nearly aligned with the Sun, indicating we are either extremely chanced or that another process is involved,” said Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb has called for the anomaly to be taken seriously, stating, “Ignoring anomalies is dangerous because it could overlook potential discoveries.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects has gained traction in recent years, particularly after the discovery of Oumuamua. This has led to increased scrutiny of objects like 3I/ATLAS, with scientists debating the implications of unusual behaviors. While some argue that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, others believe that potential technological origins should not be dismissed outright.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions continue, the scientific community will likely conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb's findings may lead to deeper investigations into the nature of interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>
