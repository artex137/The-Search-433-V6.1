      <h2>3I/ATLAS May Be a Threat - Why NASA Has Not Released New Photos of Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked significant discussion among scientists and space enthusiasts, particularly regarding NASA's decision not to release new images of the comet. The comet was first discovered in July and is currently traversing the Solar System. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This situation has drawn attention due to ongoing calls from the scientific community, particularly from Harvard scientist Dr. Avi Loeb, for NASA to provide updated images. Dr. Loeb has expressed concerns about the nature of the comet, suggesting it may not be a naturally occurring object. NASA's current inability to release new images is reportedly linked to the ongoing US federal government shutdown, which affects the agency's operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb has suggested a 30 to 40 percent chance that 3I/ATLAS is not a naturally made object.</li>
    <li>NASA has not released new images since the government shutdown began.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured high-resolution photos of the comet on 2 October.</li>
    <li>China's Tianwen-1 Orbiter released GIF images of 3I/ATLAS taken between 1 October and 4 October.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2023. On 2 October, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured a series of high-resolution images of the comet. Following this, on 3 October, the Chinese space agency released GIF images of 3I/ATLAS taken by its Tianwen-1 Orbiter. The ongoing US federal government shutdown has since prevented NASA from releasing its images.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA is a part of the federal government, which is currently shut down. Communications that do not pertain to the safety or property of life are not exempted,” said NASA in a statement to LADbible. “Imagery will be released once the government reopens.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The truth is not decided by authority. NASA has no authority over nature to tell us what nature is. I mean, it’s decided by data,” said Dr. Loeb. “I find it really peculiar for NASA, it’s sort of the signature of a bureaucratic body where hierarchy decides what is being done, and somehow, someone in the leadership decided to make a very bold and strong statement without attending to the data.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ongoing shutdown of the US federal government has impacted several agencies, including NASA. This has raised questions about transparency and communication regarding significant scientific discoveries. In contrast, the China National Space Administration has successfully captured images of 3I/ATLAS, highlighting a notable difference in governmental operations between the two countries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has indicated that it will release the images of 3I/ATLAS once the federal government reopens. Meanwhile, Dr. Loeb continues to track the comet's movements and share updates with the public.</p>
