      <h2>Thousands of UFOs Detected Beneath US Waters, Experts Warn of 'World-Changing' Undersea Phenomenon</h2>

<p>Thousands of underwater UFO sightings have been logged across US coastlines, according to a report by IBTimes UK. The UFO-tracking platform Enigma has recorded over 9,000 unexplained underwater sightings within 16 kilometres of America's shores since 2022. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has raised global speculation about potential alien submersible activity. Defence analysts have warned that these unexplained movements could indicate advanced, undisclosed technology. The report highlights that most of the sightings occurred off the coasts of California and Florida.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Over 9,000 underwater sightings logged since 2022.</li>
    <li>Majority of sightings detected near California and Florida.</li>
    <li>Objects reportedly move at speeds exceeding conventional submarines.</li>
    <li>Retired Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet has called the phenomenon 'world-changing.'</li>
    <li>The US Department of Defence has found no verified evidence of extraterrestrial technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since 2022, the UFO-tracking platform Enigma has recorded thousands of underwater sightings near US coastlines. Reports have emerged detailing objects hovering just above the ocean surface or diving into the sea without a splash. These sightings have prompted concerns from defence analysts regarding the presence of advanced technology.</p>

<p>In recent comments, Tim Burchett, a Congressman from Tennessee and member of the House Oversight Committee, has discussed encounters where naval personnel have chased underwater objects moving at extraordinary speeds. Meanwhile, the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office has stated that it has found no verified evidence of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Craft capable of moving seamlessly between air and sea represent a capability beyond any known technology,” said Tim Gallaudet, former acting administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “These incidents raise questions about whether the technology originates from advanced human sources or something not of this world,” said Congressman Tim Burchett.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>USOs, or unidentified submersible objects, are defined as underwater objects that do not match any known craft, submarine, or natural event. The sightings often involve trans-medium travel, where objects move between air and water at extraordinary speeds without visible propulsion. Security concerns have grown due to the proximity of these sightings to sensitive naval zones.</p>

<p>Despite the sensational nature of these reports, the Pentagon has urged caution, attributing many incidents to sensor anomalies, classified aircraft, or natural phenomena that are not yet understood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts are calling for increased transparency and improved maritime domain awareness to track unknown craft that may move between air, sea, and space. Ongoing scientific investigations aim to clarify the nature of these sightings while the public and media are encouraged to approach such reports critically.</p>
