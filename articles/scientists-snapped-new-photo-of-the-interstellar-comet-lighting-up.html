      <h2>Scientists snapped new photo of the interstellar comet lighting up</h2>

<p>Scientists have captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, with the photos taken on August 27 at the Gemini South telescope in Cerro Pachón, Chile. The comet is currently about 238 million miles away from Earth in the constellation Libra.</p>

<p>The images reveal details of the comet's glowing head and growing tail, allowing researchers to study its light and gain insight into its chemical composition. According to reports, the data suggests that 3I/ATLAS is made of dust similar to comets found in our own solar system, potentially indicating similarities in the building blocks for planets around other stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was photographed on August 27, 2023.</li>
    <li>Location: Cerro Pachón, Chile.</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 238 million miles.</li>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2023, by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.</li>
    <li>Travel speed: 137,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: approximately 149 million miles in October 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2023, more than 400 million miles from Earth. It has been traveling at a speed of 137,000 mph, which is too fast for the sun's gravity to capture. On August 27, scientists captured images of the comet at the Gemini South telescope, revealing its glowing head and tail as it moves closer to the sun.</p>

<p>The closest approach to Earth is expected in October 2023, at which point the comet will be hidden behind the sun but is anticipated to reappear in November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder," said Karen Meech, a University of Hawaii astronomer.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence," stated Larry Denneau, one of ATLAS' co-principal investigators, regarding speculations that the comet could be alien technology.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third confirmed interstellar comet. The first was 'Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike these previous comets, 3I/ATLAS formed in another star system and was ejected into interstellar space.</p>

<p>Comets are believed to be remnants from the early solar system, and 3I/ATLAS may be over 7 billion years old, potentially containing materials from an earlier period in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will monitor its trajectory and gather more data on its composition and behavior as it approaches the sun and reemerges in November 2023.</p>
