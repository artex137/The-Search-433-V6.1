      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS exits solar system: Could Earth be at risk?</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS has exited the solar system, marking the end of its observations after first being spotted in July 2025. The comet is the fastest ever recorded, moving away from Earth at a speed of 130,000 miles per hour, and poses no threat to the planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object documented in the history of the solar system. Scientists are studying its unique composition and eruptions, which occurred after its close flyby of the Sun in December 2025. The comet's activity has provided valuable data about the materials found in other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 130,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> already passed</li>
    <li><strong>Composition changes:</strong> ejected gases included cyanide, methane, and methanol</li>
    <li><strong>Unique features:</strong> covered with cryovolcanoes</li>
    <li><strong>Not a UFO:</strong> confirmed as a natural space rock</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers first observed comet 3I/ATLAS. By December 2025, NASA's SPHEREx observatory recorded a spike in brightness as the comet passed the Sun. This event was attributed to an eruption of gas and material from the comet's surface, following solar heating.</p>

<p>During this time, scientists noted a significant change in the comet's composition, with earlier observations in August 2025 showing it was primarily made up of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water. After the December eruption, the comet released a mixture containing more complex compounds.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025... causing it to significantly brighten," said astrophysicist Carey Lisse.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The delayed eruption was due to a thick cosmic crust that had protected the inner ices for centuries," explained scientist Phil Korngut.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to be observed, following previous discoveries that have intrigued scientists and the public alike. Its record-setting speed and unique features, such as cryovolcanoes, contribute to ongoing research into the characteristics of interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from comet 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to provide insights into the composition of other worlds for decades to come.</p>
