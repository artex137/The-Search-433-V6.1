      <h2>Harvard Professor Warns Public as NASA Faces Allegations of Hiding Truth About 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A Harvard astrophysicist has issued a warning urging people to "take vacations before October 29," alleging that NASA may be concealing critical information about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. This object, roughly the size of Manhattan, has intrigued scientists since its discovery in July as it enters the solar system.</p>

<p>Dr. Avi Loeb's claims have sparked debate within the scientific community. While space agencies assert there is no danger to Earth, the unusual chemical emissions and trajectory of 3I/ATLAS have led to speculation about its origins. Authorities are now facing calls for transparency regarding the findings related to this mysterious object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Estimated size: 5.6 kilometers in diameter</li>
    <li>Weight: Approximately 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>First detected: July 2023</li>
    <li>Emission: Four grams of nickel per second, identified as nickel tetracarbonyl</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb's warning date: October 29, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023 when astronomers identified a fast-moving object entering the solar system at nearly twice the speed of previous interstellar visitors.</p>
<p>In a recent podcast, Dr. Loeb called for public awareness and criticized NASA for lack of transparency, particularly regarding images from the Mars Orbiter that reportedly captured 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>As speculation grows, NASA scientists have maintained that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will safely pass through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Who cares about the communication departments? We want to see the data from the scientists,” Dr. Loeb said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Each observation is like opening a window into the Universe's past,” said Dr. Pérez Couto, a researcher from the University of A Coruña.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident has prompted comparisons to previous discoveries of interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov. The scientific community remains divided over the nature of 3I/ATLAS, with some researchers affirming its natural origins while others, like Dr. Loeb, suggest the possibility of artificial interference.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into 3I/ATLAS's origins and properties are ongoing, with further data expected to emerge in the coming weeks. NASA has yet to respond to Dr. Loeb's allegations, leaving both scientists and the public to await further developments.</p>
