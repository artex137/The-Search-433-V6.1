      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Makes Closest Approach to the Sun</h2>
<p>An interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has made its closest approach to the sun, coming within about 126 million miles of the star early on October 29, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the scientific insights the comet may provide. Authorities, including NASA, have emphasized the value of the comet as a cosmic time capsule, potentially containing information about its formation billions of years ago. Astronomers have observed the comet using powerful telescopes and reported intriguing findings, including the detection of atomic nickel vapor at a vast distance from the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus measures between 1,444 feet and 3.5 miles.</li>
    <li>It travels at approximately 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the sun occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will not come closer than 170 million miles to Earth, even during its closest pass around December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025. Astronomers later found that it had been observed as early as June 14, 2025. The comet made its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025.</p>
<p>Currently, the comet is on a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it does not follow a standard orbital path around the sun. It is now moving back out of the solar system and is expected to reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025, although it will not be visible without a telescope.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“An interstellar object is so valuable for the scientific community because it acts like a cosmic time capsule that could hold other chemical and physical information about other star systems where it was formed, potentially billions of years ago,” NASA reported.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We have unexpectedly detected atomic nickel vapor from the comet at a vast distance from the sun, where temperatures are extremely cold,” said an astronomer from the research team. “It’s intriguing how the nickel could be vaporizing at such low temperatures.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object detected in our solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The designation “3I” indicates it is the third interstellar object, while “ATLAS” refers to the survey that discovered it. The study of such comets helps scientists understand the origins of our solar system and other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves out of the solar system. Further analysis of the comet's composition and behavior is expected, particularly regarding the unexpected nickel vapor findings.</p>
