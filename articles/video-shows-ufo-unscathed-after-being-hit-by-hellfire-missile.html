      <h2>Video Shows UFO Unscathed After Being Hit by Hellfire Missile</h2>

<p>Congressman Eric Burlison has shared a video during a congressional hearing showing a U.S. military drone firing a Hellfire missile at an unidentified glowing orb on October 30, 2024, off the coast of Yemen. The video shows the UFO continuing to cruise at extreme speed, appearing unaffected by the 100-pound missile strike.</p>

<p>This video has raised significant questions about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and the U.S. military's stance on their existence. During the hearing, a group of military whistleblowers testified under oath about their experiences with UFOs, which the U.S. military has publicly denied. Former military police officer Jeffery Nuccetell described the video as “exceptional evidence” of UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>Weapon used: Hellfire missile</li>
    <li>Missile weight: 100 pounds</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a U.S. military drone fired a Hellfire missile at a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen. The missile struck the object, but the video captured showed no effect on the UFO, which continued to travel at high speed. Following the incident, Congressman Eric Burlison presented the video during a congressional hearing.</p>

<p>During the hearing, military whistleblowers provided testimony regarding their encounters with various types of unidentified crafts. Their accounts included descriptions of giant triangles, glowing cubes, and spherical vehicles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The evidence presented is exceptional,” said Jeffery Nuccetell, a former military police officer. “What we have seen cannot be ignored.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Some whistleblowers claimed they faced pressure from the U.S. government to remain silent about their sightings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent congressional hearing marks a significant moment in the ongoing discussion regarding UFOs and government transparency. Previous incidents have led to increased scrutiny of the military's handling of UFO reports, with many advocating for more openness about these encounters.</p>

<p>Eyewitness accounts from military personnel have often been dismissed by officials, but this hearing has reignited public interest and debate about the existence of UFOs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the claims made by the whistleblowers are expected. The congressional hearing may prompt additional inquiries into military policies regarding UFO sightings and reporting procedures.</p>
