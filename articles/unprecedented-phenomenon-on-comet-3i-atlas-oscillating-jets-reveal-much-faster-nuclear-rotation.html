      <h2>Unprecedented phenomenon on comet 3I/ATLAS: oscillating jets reveal much faster nuclear rotation</h2>

<p>An international team of astronomers has detected unprecedented behavior in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is the third object of its type confirmed to visit our Solar System. Observations revealed oscillating gas jets emanating from its rare antitail, providing crucial data to calculate the rotation speed of its nucleus. The analyses were conducted between July and September 2025, as the comet moved away from its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery deepens our understanding of this interstellar visitor, allowing scientists to establish a new point of comparison with comets native to our Solar System. The findings, submitted for peer review, may enhance knowledge of celestial bodies formed in distant stellar environments.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
<li><strong>Observation Period:</strong> July to September 2025</li>
<li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 2025</li>
<li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
<li><strong>Rotation Period of Nucleus:</strong> 15 hours and 30 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Jet Oscillation Period:</strong> 7 hours and 45 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Observation Location:</strong> Telescópio Gêmeo of Dois Metros, Observatório of Teide, Tenerife, Ilhas Canárias</li>
<li><strong>Length of Antitail:</strong> Nearly 1 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) in Chile. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its extrasolar origin. It reached perihelion in October 2025, passing within the orbit of Mars. The closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, before it began its journey back into interstellar space.</p>

<p>Between July and September 2025, astronomers conducted a 37-night observation campaign to study the comet's jets, focusing on seven specific nights in August 2025. This effort revealed the oscillating jets and allowed for precise measurements of the nucleus's rotation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The results represent a milestone in the study of interstellar objects,” said a representative from the research team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, two other interstellar visitors have been observed: 1I/’Oumuamua, which exhibited no visible cometary activity, and 2I/Borisov, which behaved like a typical comet but had unique chemical properties. The oscillating jets of 3I/ATLAS provide a new perspective on the diversity of interstellar objects and their formation processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the jets will refine models of ice sublimation and dust ejection from primordial bodies. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for comparative planetary science and testing the universality of physical laws governing comet formation and evolution.</p>
