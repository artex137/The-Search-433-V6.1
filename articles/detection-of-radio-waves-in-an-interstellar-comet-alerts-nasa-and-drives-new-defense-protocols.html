      <h2>Detection of radio waves in an interstellar comet alerts NASA and drives new defense protocols</h2>

<p>NASA and international space agencies have intensified monitoring protocols after detecting radio waves from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which crossed into the solar system in December 2025. The comet approached Earth at a safe distance of 270 million kilometers, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This detection has prompted a collaborative effort among space agencies to analyze the comet's composition and trajectory. The focus has shifted from merely tracking its orbit to conducting detailed spectral and radiofrequency analyses, providing a unique opportunity to study the formation of distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first tracked by the ATLAS system in mid-July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach was 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Radio emissions detected on October 24, 2025, at a frequency of 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA collaborated on the analysis of the comet.</li>
    <li>Observations used instruments like the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In mid-July 2025, the ATLAS system in Chile identified the approach of 3I/ATLAS, confirming its interstellar origin due to its hyperbolic trajectory. By October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected specific radio emissions from the comet, indicating its active nucleus. On December 19, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to Earth, allowing scientists to collect valuable data.</p>

<p>Following the detection of the radio waves, NASA activated its planetary defense protocols to simulate rapid response scenarios, ensuring preparedness for any potential future threats.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The ability to detect and analyze these radio signals at such vast distances demonstrates significant advances in radio astronomy,” said a spokesperson from NASA's Office of Planetary Defense Coordination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This passage provides a unique opportunity for scientific exploration and the improvement of space surveillance networks,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The passage of 3I/ATLAS marks the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov. Unlike ‘Oumuamua, which displayed enigmatic behavior, 3I/ATLAS and Borisov exhibited characteristics typical of comets, such as tails and gas release, enhancing understanding of interstellar material.</p>

<p>These events underscore the growing recognition that interstellar objects may frequently traverse our solar system, suggesting that material exchange between stars occurs more commonly than previously believed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels deeper into space. The data collected will be analyzed for years to enhance computational models related to the formation and dynamics of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>
