      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shrinks After Close Encounter with Sun</h2>

<p>Astronomers have reported that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shrunk and partially disintegrated after its close pass by the Sun on 29 October 2025. This unusual phenomenon has left experts puzzled, as the comet displayed no typical tail and lost visible mass following its perihelion.</p>

<p>The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS, officially designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), challenges existing theories about cometary behaviour and raises questions about its origin. The object, discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, is one of only three confirmed interstellar visitors to our Solar System. Scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth on 19 December 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units (AU), posing no threat to the planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS has experienced a 13% reduction in visible size.</li>
  <li>Perihelion occurred on 29 October 2025 at approximately 1.36 AU from the Sun.</li>
  <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected on 19 December 2025 at around 1.8 AU.</li>
  <li>Discovered on 1 July 2025 by ATLAS in Chile.</li>
  <li>Infrared spectroscopy revealed a CO₂-dominated coma with traces of H₂O, CO, and dust.</li>
  <li>At least seven active jets have been observed on the object's surface.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is moving on a hyperbolic escape trajectory away from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by ATLAS in Chile. It entered the inner Solar System and reached perihelion on 29 October 2025, coming within approximately 1.36 AU of the Sun. Following this close encounter, astronomers noted a reduction in the object's visible size and the absence of a typical cometary tail.</p>
<p>The object is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, at around 1.8 AU, allowing for further observations of its behaviour and structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The strange evolution of 3I/ATLAS is unlike anything previously observed in space,” said an unnamed astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The symmetrical pattern of these jets could resemble a 'thruster-like system,'” suggested astrophysicist Avi Loeb, although mainstream astronomers attribute the behaviour to natural causes.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins ʻOumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019) as one of the few confirmed interstellar visitors. Its unique characteristics have sparked renewed debate about the nature of such objects and their evolution when exposed to solar radiation. The scientific consensus is that 3I/ATLAS is a natural interstellar comet, despite its highly anomalous features.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers from NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and independent observatories will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for changes in brightness and structure as it moves beyond the orbit of Mars. While some fragmentation is possible, no complete disintegration has been confirmed at this time.</p>
