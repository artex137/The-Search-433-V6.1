      <h2>Neil deGrasse Tyson on 3I/ATLAS: ‘Alien of the Gaps’ theory isn’t science</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb and Neil deGrasse Tyson have discussed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a recent media appearance. The comet is approaching the solar system at a speed of 210,000 km/h and will pass close to four planets and the Sun, but not Earth. Their comments highlight the ongoing fascination with the possibility of alien life associated with cosmic phenomena.</p>

<p>The conversation around 3I/ATLAS and its unusual properties has gained traction as some speculate about its origins. Loeb has suggested that if the comet does not conform to known models of comets or asteroids, an artificial explanation should not be dismissed outright. Tyson cautions against jumping to conclusions about extraterrestrial involvement, advising that a lack of understanding should not lead to assumptions about alien technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>It will pass close to four planets and the Sun, but not Earth.</li>
    <li>Loeb and Tyson have both expressed the need for more data on the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has properties that do not match typical comet or asteroid behavior.</li>
    <li>Loeb has previously made headlines for his views on interstellar objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed approaching the solar system, drawing comparisons to other interstellar objects like Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019). Both Loeb and Tyson have commented on the comet’s unusual speed and brightness, which suggest it is not bound by the Sun's gravity.</p>
<p>Loeb has proposed that the object’s characteristics warrant consideration of artificial explanations, while Tyson has warned against hastily attributing its mysteries to extraterrestrial life. Their comments reflect a broader dialogue on the interpretation of unidentified cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it doesn’t behave like a comet or asteroid, we should at least consider an artificial explanation instead of ruling it out,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The moment you say, ‘I don’t know what I’m looking at, therefore I know what I’m looking at. I’m looking at aliens.’ That is a leap,” stated Neil deGrasse Tyson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussions around 3I/ATLAS are part of a larger trend in which unidentified astronomical objects are often linked to the possibility of alien life. Past incidents, such as the discovery of Oumuamua, have fueled public interest and speculation regarding extraterrestrial technology.</p>
<p>Tyson referred to the concept of the "God of the Gaps," suggesting that attributing unknown phenomena to aliens is a modern replacement for earlier explanations based on divine intervention.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Both scientists emphasize the importance of gathering more data on 3I/ATLAS. Ongoing observations may provide further insights into the comet's properties and origins, allowing for a more informed discussion about its nature.</p>
