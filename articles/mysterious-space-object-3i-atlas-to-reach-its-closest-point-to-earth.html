      <h2>Mysterious space object 3i/ATLAS to reach its closest point to Earth</h2>

<p>A mysterious object known as 3i/ATLAS is set to reach its closest point to Earth on Friday, travelling at a speed of 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph) and passing at a distance of approximately 274 million km (170 million miles). While there is a near consensus among astronomers that the object is a comet from outside our solar system, Harvard University astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb has claimed it could potentially be an alien craft.</p>

<p>This event has drawn significant attention as scientists and space agencies prepare to observe the object closely. The US and European space agencies have focused cameras from a dozen spacecraft on 3i/ATLAS, emphasizing that its origins are natural, despite some controversial assertions regarding its nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3i/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li>Closest approach distance: 274 million km (170 million miles)</li>
    <li>First spotted: July 2023</li>
    <li>Passed Mars: Early October 2023</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 8 billion years</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: NASA, European Space Agency</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3i/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023 as a distant dot of light. It passed Mars in early October and briefly disappeared behind the sun. Following its close approach to Earth, it will continue on its trajectory towards Jupiter before fading from view.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet. All evidence points to it being a comet,” said Amit Kshatriya from NASA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It is just nonsense,” stated Professor Chris Lintott from the University of Oxford, regarding claims of extraterrestrial origins. “There is nothing this thing has done that we haven't seen elsewhere.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Professor Loeb has responded, stating, “At the foundation of science is the humility to learn... They're not willing to learn something new.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In 2017, Professor Loeb made similar claims about another interstellar object, Oumuamua, suggesting it could be an alien craft. Such theories have sparked debates among scientists, with many advocating for skepticism regarding claims lacking substantial evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3i/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, space agencies will continue to monitor its trajectory and gather data to further understand its composition and origins.</p>
