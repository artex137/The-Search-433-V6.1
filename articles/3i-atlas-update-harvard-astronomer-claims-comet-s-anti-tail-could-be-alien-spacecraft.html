      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Harvard Astronomer Claims Comet's Anti-Tail Could Be Alien Spacecraft</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth at 06:02 UT on Friday, December 19, 2023. Currently travelling at a speed of 130,000 miles per hour, the comet is approximately 167 million miles (1.8 astronomical units) away from Earth. This event marks a significant moment for astronomers, who have been closely observing the object since it was first detected.</p>

<p>This close encounter is important for scientists, as it provides a rare opportunity to study an object that has traveled through space for eons. The presence of a peculiar feature known as an 'anti-tail' has sparked debate within the scientific community regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Harvard University's Professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the anti-tail could indicate the presence of an artificial spacecraft, while other experts propose more conventional explanations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is scheduled to pass Earth at 06:02 UT on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object is approximately 167 million miles (1.8 astronomical units) away from Earth.</li>
    <li>It is travelling at a speed of 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>The comet features a unique 'anti-tail' that points towards the sun.</li>
    <li>Professor Avi Loeb proposes that the anti-tail could suggest the presence of artificial objects.</li>
    <li>Experts at the European Space Agency believe the tail is caused by outgassing of larger solid particles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope first observed 3I/ATLAS on July 21, 2023. Since then, astronomers have noted a persistent protrusion from the comet's nucleus, dubbed the 'anti-tail'. On December 13, a sharp image captured by the Teerasak Thaluang telescope in Thailand confirmed the feature's continued prominence, extending for hundreds of thousands of miles.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches the sun, its 'day side' heats up, leading to the ejection of dust particles towards the sun. This phenomenon has raised questions about the object's composition and origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By recognizing anomalies, we can learn something new. By ignoring them, we remain ignorant,” said Professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“All these things are consistent with a comet nucleus of typical size or smaller, sublimating in sunlight and blowing out dust particles,” stated Professor David Jewitt of UCLA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing interest in interstellar objects, following the arrival of 'Oumuamua in 2017. Scientists have been keen to understand these visitors, as they provide insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>
<p>The debate surrounding the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS reflects a broader trend in astronomy, where new discoveries often challenge existing paradigms and prompt re-evaluation of our understanding of cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its perigee, astronomers are preparing to gather data that could enhance our understanding of interstellar objects. The observations made during this close flyby will contribute to ongoing discussions about the nature of such celestial bodies and their implications for our knowledge of the universe.</p>
