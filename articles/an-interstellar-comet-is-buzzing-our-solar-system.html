      <h2>An Interstellar Comet Is Buzzing our Solar System</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has passed through the solar system, reaching speeds of 246,000 kilometres per hour as it traveled past Mars and around the sun. NASA released images of the comet on October 31, 2023, after a 43-day government shutdown, which did not cause any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object from outside the solar system to visit Earth. NASA and the European Space Agency have utilized this opportunity to document the comet's journey using data from various spacecraft and ground telescopes. The comet poses no threat to Earth, as it will pass no closer than 270 million kilometres from the planet on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2023, by a NASA-funded telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Comet's closest approach to the sun occurred on October 30, 2023, within 209 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The comet measures between 427 metres and 1.1 kilometres across.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency have tracked the comet using at least 20 different instruments.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet approached the sun on October 30, 2023, passing within 209 million kilometres. Following the end of the U.S. government shutdown, NASA released images of the comet on October 31. The comet will pass Earth on December 19, 2023, before continuing its journey into deep space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We were quick to be able to say, 'Yup, it definitely behaves like a comet.’ We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” said Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “You might as well argue that the moon is made of cheese,” stated Chris Lintott, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford, regarding claims that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, following the discovery of Comet Oumuamua in 2017 and another object not disclosed. The scientific community remains skeptical of claims that these objects are alien spacecraft, attributing their unusual characteristics to natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The comet's trajectory will be monitored as it continues its journey back into deep space, with various spacecraft scheduled to observe it as it departs the solar system in the spring of 2024.</p>
