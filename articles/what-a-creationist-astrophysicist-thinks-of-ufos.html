      <h2>What a Creationist Astrophysicist Thinks of UFOs</h2>

<p>Astrophysicist Hugh Norman Ross has published a paper in the journal Religions, arguing that humans are likely alone in the universe. The paper, released in December 2025, discusses the implications of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and claims that intelligent life is rare due to various cosmic threats. Ross’s findings have sparked significant discussion among scientific communities and theological circles.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it touches on the intersection of science and faith, particularly in the context of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and their implications. Authorities and scholars are now examining Ross's claims, especially his assertion that UAPs may be manifestations of spiritual entities rather than extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Paper published in December 2025 in the journal Religions</li>
    <li>Ross argues that intelligent life is rare in the universe</li>
    <li>97.8% of surveyed scientists believe in extraterrestrial life</li>
    <li>Ross claims UAPs are residual unidentified aerial phenomena</li>
    <li>Paper discusses spiritual dimensions and the existence of angels</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, Hugh Norman Ross released his paper in Religions, which argued for the rarity of intelligent life in the universe. The paper gained traction due to its provocative claims about UAPs and their possible spiritual implications. Ross has spent over 40 years at his ministry, Reasons to Believe, exploring the relationship between science and faith.</p>

<p>Following the publication, discussions have emerged regarding the implications of Ross’s findings on both scientific inquiry and religious beliefs. His claims have prompted further scrutiny from both scientists and theologians.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I found the Bible to be the only ancient text I studied that showed itself 100 percent accurate about every scientific issue it addressed,” Ross stated in his paper. “It stood alone in accurately predicting scientific discoveries made by research scientists, often thousands of years in advance of the discoveries.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Angels, according to the Bible, reside in a spiritual realm and possess several more spiritual capabilities than do humans,” Ross wrote, discussing the nature of UAPs.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to Ross's paper, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has been a topic of interest among scientists for decades. A 2024 survey indicated that a vast majority of scientists believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life. Ross's unique perspective combines scientific inquiry with a religious framework, which has drawn both support and criticism.</p>

<p>Ross's claims regarding UAPs as potential spiritual entities have been met with skepticism, particularly because they lack physical evidence. His assertions raise questions about the nature of belief and the interpretation of scientific findings in light of spiritual claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community will likely continue to debate Ross's conclusions, especially concerning the existence of UAPs and their implications. Ongoing research into extraterrestrial life and the intersection of science and faith will shape future discussions in both fields.</p>
