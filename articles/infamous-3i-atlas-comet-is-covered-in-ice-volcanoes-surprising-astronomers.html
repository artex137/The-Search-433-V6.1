      <h2>Infamous 3I/ATLAS comet is covered in ice volcanoes, surprising astronomers</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of active ice volcanoes, according to an international team of astronomers. This discovery comes as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth, which has captivated researchers since its detection in July 2023.</p>

<p>The findings, detailed in a pre-print study, may alter the scientific community's understanding of comet formation both in deep space and within our solar system. Astronomers have directed telescopes and sensitive instruments at 3I/ATLAS as it travels at a speed of approximately 209,000 kilometres per hour through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the second interstellar object tracked through our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet was first detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 kilometres per hour).</li>
    <li>The comet is currently about 2.5 astronomical units from the sun (approximately 185.9 million miles).</li>
    <li>Evidence of cryovolcanism challenges existing models of comet formation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, they have monitored the comet closely as it travels through the solar system. Recently, researchers noted a significant increase in brightness, indicating potential cryovolcanic activity.</p>

<p>On reaching around 2.5 astronomical units from the sun, the comet exhibited a sharp and lasting surge in brightness, suggesting an eruption of its entire water-ice surface layer rather than a sudden explosion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar visitors like 3I/ATLAS continue to challenge and refine our understanding of planetary-system formation and the chemical evolution of small bodies,” the study’s authors wrote. “Each newly discovered object reveals unexpected properties that test and expand current models.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of cryovolcanism on 3I/ATLAS is particularly significant because it differs from typical comet behavior. Most comets possess a protective dusty mantle that can obscure such eruptions. Researchers believe that the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS may indicate a more varied environment of formation compared to traditional models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The study is currently awaiting peer review, and further investigations will be necessary to confirm the presence of cryovolcanism on 3I/ATLAS and its implications for comet formation theories.</p>
