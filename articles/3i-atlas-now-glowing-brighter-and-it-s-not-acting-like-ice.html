      <h2>3I/ATLAS Now Glowing Brighter—And It's Not Acting Like Ice</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unexpected behaviour since its arrival, baffling astronomers worldwide. Observations captured on 11 November 2023 by Ray’s Astrophotography have shown the comet glowing brighter and behaving unlike any comet previously observed in the Solar System. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This unusual activity has sparked intense debate among scientists regarding the nature of interstellar matter. The comet’s current performance is significant, as it offers a rare glimpse into materials that constitute other solar systems. Astronomers are now prioritizing 3I/ATLAS for observation, seeking to understand its complex behaviour and the implications it has for our understanding of comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of new observations: 11 November 2023</li>
    <li>Location of observations: not disclosed</li>
    <li>Photographer: Ray’s Astrophotography</li>
    <li>Current status: Active target for telescopes globally</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has been observed since its arrival, but recent images taken on 11 November have marked a significant change. The comet has appeared distinctly larger and more energetic, leading to questions about its internal structure and composition.</p>
<p>As astronomers study its behaviour, they have noted that 3I/ATLAS is emitting a radiant green hue, indicating dramatic internal changes and chemical reactions. This phenomenon differs greatly from typical cometary behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Its composition and geometry still don't match any known object in our Solar System,” said an unnamed researcher, emphasizing the comet’s status as a cosmological anomaly.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the latest observations, 3I/ATLAS was already known for its unpredictable activity. Its recent transformation has heightened interest in understanding interstellar objects and their implications for cosmic science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to uncover the mysteries behind its behaviour. Further observations are expected as scientists seek to determine whether the comet is breaking apart or undergoing an internal transformation.</p>
