      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Passes Earth, Offering A Once-In-A-Lifetime Chance</h2>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS has approached Earth, reaching its closest point on Friday, 19 December 2023, at approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 270 million kilometres (168 million miles) away. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to this event.</p>

<p>This close encounter presents a significant opportunity for scientists to study material from outside our solar system. The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no danger to Earth or other planets. Researchers are now focusing their observations on the comet to gather data that could enhance our understanding of planetary formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches closest approach on 19 December 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth will be approximately 270 million kilometres (168 million miles).</li>
    <li>Comet was discovered in July 2023 by NASA-funded ATLAS telescopes in Chile.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Observations are being conducted by major observatories including the Hubble Space Telescope and the JUICE Jupiter probe.</li>
    <li>The public can view the event via a livestream on 18 December at 23:00 EST (04:00 GMT on 19 December).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, NASA-funded ATLAS telescopes in Chile discovered Comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, it has been on a trajectory towards Earth, culminating in its closest approach on 19 December 2023. Major observatories have been preparing to observe the comet as it sheds volatile dust and gases, providing valuable data on its composition.</p>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope and the JUICE Jupiter probe captured new images of the comet last week, enhancing the scientific community's understanding of the interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This flyby is an event of colossal significance for researchers around the globe. It offers a rare sample of material from another star system,” said an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are examining the building blocks of worlds elsewhere in the galaxy,” the representative added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the path of other interstellar objects, including 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These previous encounters have provided critical insights into the nature of materials from other star systems.</p>

<p>This event emphasizes the growing interest in interstellar objects and their potential to inform our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the comet's close approach, researchers will continue to analyze data collected from various observatories to refine models of planetary genesis and investigate the prevalence of organic molecules in the universe.</p>
