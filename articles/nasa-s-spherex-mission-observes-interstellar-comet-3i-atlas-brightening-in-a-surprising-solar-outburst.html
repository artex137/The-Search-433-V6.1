      <h2>NASA's SPHEREx mission observes interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS brightening in a surprising solar outburst</h2>

<p>NASA’s SPHEREx space telescope has observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS dramatically brightening as it exits the solar system in December 2025. This outburst marks a rare event, as comets typically fade after passing the Sun.</p>

<p>This observation is significant for astronomers, as it provides a unique opportunity to study materials formed around another star. The data collected by SPHEREx includes chemical compositions that could yield insights into the origins of comets and the nature of interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: December 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Near the outer solar system</li>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Previous closest approach to the Sun: October 2025</li>
    <li>Third confirmed interstellar object: Following 1I/'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun, a time when cometary activity typically peaks. By December 2025, SPHEREx detected a significant outburst from the comet as it began to exit the inner solar system.</p>
<p>During this observation, SPHEREx recorded the release of various gases and organic compounds, including water vapour and carbon dioxide, as the comet continued to brighten.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet was full-on erupting after its close flyby of the Sun,” said Carey Lisse, lead author of the study at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Phil Korngut, a co-author of the study, noted that the comet likely formed a radiation-processed shell during its long journey between stars, with pristine ices remaining locked away beneath this shell.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to be recorded, highlighting the significance of such observations in understanding the composition of materials from beyond our solar system. The previous interstellar comets, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, also provided valuable data on the properties of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the data collected from SPHEREx to further understand the chemical makeup of comet 3I/ATLAS and its implications for the study of interstellar materials.</p>
