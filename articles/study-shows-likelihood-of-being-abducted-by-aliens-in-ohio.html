      <h2>Study shows likelihood of being abducted by aliens in Ohio</h2>

<p>Ohio has been identified as having a 1 in 89 chance of alien abduction, according to a study released by Canada Sports Betting. The Alien Abduction Odds Index 2026 ranks Ohio 21st in the U.S. for the probability of such incidents, based on various UFO sighting reports.</p>

<p>This study highlights the frequency of UFO sightings and the details surrounding them, prompting interest from both the public and authorities. Analysts have emphasized that the findings do not predict actual abductions but rather reflect historical reporting trends in the state.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study conducted by Canada Sports Betting.</li>
    <li>Ohio ranks No. 21 in the U.S. with a 1 in 89 chance (1.13%) of alien abduction.</li>
    <li>New Hampshire has the highest incidence of UFO sightings, with 24.34 reports per 100,000 residents.</li>
    <li>New Mexico has the lowest probability at 0.23% (1 in 431).</li>
    <li>Study utilizes data from The National UFO Reporting Center, Canadian UFO Survey, and other agencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, the first well-known UFO sighting occurred when businessman Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine high-speed objects near Mount Rainier, Washington. The study, released in 2026, utilized data from various agencies to assess the likelihood of alien abductions based on historical UFO sightings.</p>
<p>The analysis included reports mentioning missing time and physical encounters, measuring their consistency over time. The rankings were established on a 0-100 scale, converted into implied probabilities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"The implied probability is not a prediction," analysts wrote in the study. "It doesn’t mean an abduction is likely to happen. It simply shows how often abduction-style reports have appeared in one region compared with others."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have been a topic of public interest for decades, with numerous reports documented annually across the globe. The Alien Abduction Odds Index aims to quantify the likelihood of abductions based on historical data, allowing for comparisons between states.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities may continue to monitor UFO sighting reports and public interest in the topic, but no formal investigations regarding abductions have been announced at this time.</p>
