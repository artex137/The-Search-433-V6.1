      <h2>Scientists reveal exact date mysterious object that Harvard scientist claims is 'not natural' will be closest to Earth</h2>

<p>Scientists have announced that Comet 3I/ATLAS, which a Harvard scientist has described as "not natural," will be closest to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet was first detected by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, back in July.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object to come from interstellar space, indicating it arrived from beyond our solar system. Authorities, including scientists from Lowell Observatory and the US Naval Research Laboratory, are continuing to monitor the comet due to its unusual characteristics, including its high speed of over 41 miles per second.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Closest Distance to the Sun:</strong> About 210 million kilometers on October 30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Detection:</strong> First spotted in July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Interstellar space</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 41 miles per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. On October 30, 2023, the comet passed within 210 million kilometers of the Sun. Scientists have since noted its unusual rapid brightening, prompting further investigation into its properties and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reason for 3I’s rapid brightening, which far exceeds the brightening rate of most Oort cloud comets at similar radial distance, remains unclear,” said Qicheng Zhang of Lowell Observatory and Karl Battams of the US Naval Research Laboratory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Oddities in nucleus properties like composition, shape, or structure— which might have been acquired from its host system or over its long interstellar journey—may likewise contribute,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its high speed and trajectory have raised questions about its origins and potential behavior as it approaches the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS in the coming months to better understand its behavior and characteristics as it approaches Earth.</p>
