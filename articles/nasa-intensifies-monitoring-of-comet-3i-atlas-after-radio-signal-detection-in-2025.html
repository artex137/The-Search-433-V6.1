      <h2>NASA intensifies monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS after radio signal detection in 2025</h2>

<p>NASA has intensified its monitoring of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS following the detection of a radio signal on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. The signal, captured at a frequency of 1.6 GHz, suggests ongoing chemical activity on the comet, which is currently on a trajectory that will bring it close to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This monitoring is crucial as 3I/ATLAS is the third object identified from outside the Solar System. NASA's planetary defense team has mobilized in response to its atypical behavior and emissions, as scientists seek to understand its composition and the processes occurring on its surface.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected by ATLAS system on July 1, 2025, in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Comet's nucleus ranges from 320 meters to 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Radio signal detected at 1.6 GHz indicates potential natural activity on the comet.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are involved in ongoing monitoring and analysis of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS system in Río Hurtado, Chile, identified comet 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third interstellar object detected. Following its identification, NASA's planetary defense team began intensive monitoring due to the comet's unusual trajectory and emissions.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected a radio signal from 3I/ATLAS, which suggested chemical processes influenced by solar radiation. In response, NASA convened a group of experts in August 2025 to analyze the comet's behavior and chemical spectrum.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"The detection of the radio signal reinforces the hypothesis of natural activity intrinsic to the celestial body," said a representative from NASA's Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as a fragment ejected from another star system millions of years ago. Its hyperbolic trajectory and speed of approximately 100,000 km/h differentiate it from other known comets. Prior interstellar comets, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of distant stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Advanced telescopes, including the Very Large Telescope and James Webb, will analyze the comet's chemical spectrum to identify compounds that may shed light on its origin and evolution. The comet will exit the Solar System after its December approach, continuing its journey through interstellar space.</p>
