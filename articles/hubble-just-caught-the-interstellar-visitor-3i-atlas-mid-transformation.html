      <h2>Hubble captures interstellar comet 3I/Atlas mid-transformation</h2>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has observed the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas as it undergoes significant changes, with the latest imaging occurring on November 30, 2023, from a distance of approximately 286 million kilometers from Earth. The comet, discovered just six months ago, has attracted considerable attention from astronomers worldwide.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has joined the observation efforts with its Juice probe, which is currently en route to Jupiter. Juice has aimed several instruments at 3I/Atlas to gather data, with first images already received. These observations are crucial as they provide insights into the comet's behavior as it approaches perihelion—the point in its orbit closest to the Sun—where it exhibits increased activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered six months ago.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet on November 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>Juice probe's observations began in November 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of 273 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Juice is expected to deliver additional data by February 2024.</li>
    <li>Amateur astronomers can observe the comet with basic telescopes during its closest approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first discovered six months ago and has since been the subject of intense scrutiny by astronomers. On November 2, 2023, the comet made its closest pass to the Sun, leading to a surge in its activity marked by plumes of sublimated ice and dust. Two days later, Hubble captured images of the comet. In November, the Juice probe turned its instruments towards 3I/Atlas to gather data, with first images received shortly thereafter. The probe is expected to provide further insights by February 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The stunning shots captured by Juice are just the beginning. We expect to learn much more about 3I/Atlas as we process the data,” said a representative from ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Its unique characteristics and behavior as it nears the Sun have sparked interest in understanding the nature of interstellar visitors to our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, further observations from ground-based telescopes are anticipated. Scientists and amateur astronomers alike will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as new data emerges from both Hubble and the Juice probe.</p>
