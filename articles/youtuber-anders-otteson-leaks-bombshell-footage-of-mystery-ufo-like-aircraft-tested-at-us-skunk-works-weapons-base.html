      <h2>YouTuber Anders Otteson leaks bombshell footage of mystery UFO-like aircraft tested at US Skunk Works weapons base</h2>

<p>Investigative YouTuber Anders Otteson has filmed a mysterious UFO-like aircraft being tested at Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works facility in the California desert. Otteson camped for hours on public land near the Helendale radar-testing site, where he recorded a dark, wing-shaped object mounted on a tall white pillar. The footage shows the craft floating and rotating, suggesting it is under radar or stealth testing.</p>

<p>This development matters as it raises questions about the nature of technology being tested at Skunk Works, a division known for its top-secret military projects. Authorities, including US lawmakers, have expressed a growing interest in unidentified aerial phenomena, leading to increased scrutiny of military testing sites like Helendale.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Filming occurred at the Helendale radar-testing site, California.</li>
    <li>The object recorded appears to resemble an early-stage fighter jet or advanced drone.</li>
    <li>The Helendale facility features a 200-foot underground chamber.</li>
    <li>Lockheed Martin Skunk Works has a history of developing classified military aircraft.</li>
    <li>US lawmakers, including Senator Marco Rubio, have called for transparency regarding unidentified objects in US airspace.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Anders Otteson filmed the object at the Helendale site during his visit, where he camped on public land. His video captures the aircraft floating and rotating, indicating it might be undergoing radar or stealth testing. Otteson has previously documented other military locations, including near Area 51, suggesting a pattern of interest in classified military technology.</p>

<p>The Helendale facility, designed to test radar signatures and stealth performance away from public view, has been a focal point for speculation regarding advanced military technology. The site’s history includes the development of several secret aircraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If the United States ever had access to real extraterrestrial or ‘non-human’ technology, Skunk Works would likely be the group responsible for testing it,” Otteson told The Sun.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works division is known for creating some of the United States’ most classified military aircraft, including the U-2 spy plane, SR-71 Blackbird, and F-117 Nighthawk stealth jet. The facility’s long-standing reputation for secrecy has led to claims that the military may be concealing next-generation aircraft or alien-derived technology.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been increasing interest from US lawmakers regarding unidentified aerial phenomena, with numerous hearings conducted to address the public's concerns. Reports suggest that the US may possess “exotic” technology that remains largely unexplained.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the footage and the nature of the aircraft are expected to continue. The public and lawmakers alike are likely to press for further disclosures about the activities occurring within Skunk Works and the Helendale facility.</p>
