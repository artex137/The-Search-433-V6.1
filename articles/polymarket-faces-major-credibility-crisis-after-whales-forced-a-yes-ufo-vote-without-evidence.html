      <h2>Polymarket faces major credibility crisis after whales forced a “YES” UFO vote without evidence</h2>

<p>Polymarket has resolved a $16 million market in favour of “YES” regarding whether the Trump administration will declassify UFO files in 2025, despite no documents being released. The decision was made after significant buying activity peaked at between 99 to 99.9 cents shortly before the market closed.</p>

<p>This resolution has raised questions about the integrity of Polymarket’s betting platform, as it came after multiple disputes recorded through UMA’s Optimistic Oracle. Authorities in the cryptocurrency community are now examining the implications of this outcome for market credibility and the potential influence of large bettors, commonly referred to as "whales."</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Market resolution amount: $16 million</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Polymarket has faced scrutiny following the resolution of its UFO declassification market. Late-session buying activity prompted a surge in the “YES” vote, leading to the market’s closure.</p>

<p>The resolution was confirmed through UMA’s Optimistic Oracle, which had logged several disputes before reaching a final decision. This has sparked discussions about the reliability of the mechanisms in place for market resolutions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The outcome raises important questions about market integrity and the influence of large bettors,” a spokesperson for Polymarket said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>

The involvement of large bettors has been a recurring concern, prompting discussions about the fairness of the betting environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigations into the market's resolution process and its implications for future betting practices on Polymarket, focusing on enhancing transparency and fairness.</p>
