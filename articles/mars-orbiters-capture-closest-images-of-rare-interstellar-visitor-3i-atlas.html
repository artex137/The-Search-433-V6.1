      <h2>Mars orbiters capture closest images of rare interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>In early October, astronomers have observed Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, gliding past Mars. The comet, which is only the third interstellar comet ever recorded, passed approximately 18.6 million miles from Mars on October 3, 2023. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the observation.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it offers a rare glimpse into an object born from a different star system. The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express were positioned to capture images of the comet, which scientists believe could be three billion years older than our Solar System. The images may provide insights into the composition and characteristics of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 3, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 18.6 million miles</li>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Number of interstellar comets observed: 3</li>
    <li>First spotted by: ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile on July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Instruments used: CaSSIS camera on TGO and Mars Express</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory using various telescopes. On October 3, 2023, the comet made its closest approach to Mars, prompting the ESA's Mars orbiters to capture images and study its composition.</p>

<p>The TGO successfully captured a sequence of images showing the comet's nucleus and its surrounding coma. The Mars Express orbiter also attempted to photograph the comet, although its images did not yield clear results due to limited exposure time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” said Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the CaSSIS camera on TGO.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one,” said Colin Wilson, Mars Express and ExoMars project scientist at ESA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS provide valuable information about the formation of solar systems beyond our own. Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects have been observed, including 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017. Each new discovery enhances our understanding of these distant bodies and their origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach to the Sun, the ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will observe 3I/ATLAS from a distance, with data expected to arrive in February 2026. ESA is also planning a mission called Comet Interceptor, set to launch in 2029 to study fresh comets and potentially discover more interstellar objects.</p>
