      <h2>NASA avoids comments about interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS and generates debates among global astronomers</h2>

<p>The global astronomical community has raised questions about NASA's prolonged silence regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile in July 2025. The comet approaches the Sun but has not been the subject of official updates from NASA, despite being monitored for months.</p>

<p>This situation has drawn attention due to the scientific significance of 3I/ATLAS, which marks the third recorded case of an interstellar object. Preliminary observations have revealed unusual characteristics, prompting researchers to seek clarity from NASA. Other institutions, such as the European Space Agency (ESA), have released preliminary data, intensifying discussions about the reasons behind NASA's lack of information.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Comet is approximately 670 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Speed: 209,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Close passage to Mars on October 3, 2025, at a distance of about 30 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Expected to return to interstellar space after March 2026.</li>
    <li>Comet's mass estimated to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times greater than expected for its size.</li>
    <li>Age estimated between 7 and 14 billion years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. NASA's ATLAS telescope captured the comet's image at a distance of 670 million kilometers from the Sun. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its interstellar origin.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2025, probes from ESA recorded the comet's flyby of Mars. Observations showed an elongated structure without signs of fragmentation. The James Webb Space Telescope identified volatile compounds in August 2025, while the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet on July 21, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The lack of updates from NASA contrasts significantly with the releases of preliminary data by other institutions,” a source within the astronomical community stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The silence from NASA has generated considerable debate within the scientific community. Previous interstellar objects have received more immediate attention and updates. The discrepancy in communication has led researchers to question the agency's policies regarding transparency and data sharing.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories are adjusting equipment to capture new data as 3I/ATLAS reappears in December 2025. Scientists anticipate further analysis of the comet's composition and behavior before it departs for deep space after March 2026.</p>
