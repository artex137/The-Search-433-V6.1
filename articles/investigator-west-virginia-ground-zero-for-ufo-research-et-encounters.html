      <h2>Investigator: West Virginia ground-zero for UFO research, ET encounters</h2>

<p>GREEN BANK, W.Va. — Renowned paranormal investigator Dave Spinks has stated that West Virginia holds a significant place in UFO research due to its historical encounters and its contributions to the search for extraterrestrial life. Spinks, known for his appearances on the Travel Channel and other networks, emphasized the state's rich UFO lore during a recent discussion. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to these encounters.</p>

<p>Spinks has highlighted the importance of West Virginia's role in early UFO sightings, referencing incidents involving the Mothman and the Flatwoods Monster. He noted that the Green Bank Observatory was where Frank Drake established the first telescopes for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program. Local authorities and enthusiasts continue to explore these historical incidents and their implications for understanding potential extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>During the 1960s, sightings of the Mothman in the Ohio Valley near Point Pleasant increased, capturing the attention of local residents and researchers.</p>
<p>Dave Spinks began collecting notes about UFO encounters in the 1990s, inspired by his childhood experiences in the area.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Two of the earliest and most famous encounters in the U.S. were reported here,” Spinks said, referring to the Mothman and Flatwoods Monster.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Essentially, I have three questions I wish to answer. These are what drive me. What happens when we die? Are there unknown creatures walking among us? And are we alone in the universe?” Spinks said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>West Virginia has a long history of alleged UFO encounters, with significant events dating back to the mid-20th century. The state's rural landscape and low light pollution make it an ideal location for stargazing and UFO sightings.

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Spinks continues to investigate paranormal phenomena and UFO sightings while advocating for a more truthful portrayal of these events in media. His recent purchase of an allegedly haunted house in Indiana will serve as a new site for his research.</p>
