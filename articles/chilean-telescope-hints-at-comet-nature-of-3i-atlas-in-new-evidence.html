      <h2>Chilean telescope hints at comet nature of 3I/ATLAS in new evidence</h2>

<p>The Gemini South Telescope in Chile has captured new evidence suggesting that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is indeed a comet. The discovery was made public on October 2, 2023, and shows a growing tail and a wide coma of dust and gas surrounding the object as it approaches the solar system.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it adds to the ongoing debate among scientists regarding the true nature of 3I/ATLAS, which has been contentious since its first appearance on July 1, 2023. The National Space Foundation’s NoirLab reported that the evidence supports the active nature of 3I/ATLAS as it moves safely through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery made by the Gemini South Telescope in Chile on October 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object is currently 384 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass 30 million kilometres from Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected in December 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Webb Telescope has detected CO2, water ice, carbon monoxide, water, and carbonyl sulfide in 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, 3I/ATLAS was first observed. Since then, it has generated discussion in the scientific community over its classification. On October 2, 2023, the Gemini South Telescope provided new evidence indicating that the object has a comet-like structure, including a growing tail.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, NASA’s Webb Telescope has contributed to the understanding of 3I/ATLAS by identifying various chemical components, further supporting the argument for its cometary nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The recent discovery also validates the active nature of 3I/ATLAS as it moves harmlessly through the sun,” according to the National Space Foundation’s NoirLab.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has disputed the comet classification, stating, “3I/ATLAS could be an alien probe which could be nuclear-powered capable of producing its own light.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time an interstellar object has been observed. 3I/ATLAS is the third such object identified, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each discovery has sparked discussions regarding the origins and nature of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations are expected as 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth in December 2023. Scientists will continue to study the object to better understand its composition and behavior as it travels through the solar system.</p>
