      <h2>Why 3I/ATLAS' Sunward Jet Holds Clues to Its True Nature</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has drawn attention from astronomers globally since its discovery in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The object, estimated to be between <strong>20-40 kilometres</strong> in size, is moving on a hyperbolic orbit at over <strong>50 kilometres per second</strong>, indicating its extrasolar origin. Unlike previous interstellar objects, 3I/ATLAS has exhibited a jet pointing towards the Sun, a phenomenon that has raised questions among scientists.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it challenges existing understandings of cometary behavior and may provide insight into the composition and processes of interstellar objects. Astronomers, led by Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>, are analyzing the anomalies presented by 3I/ATLAS to better understand its nature and the implications for interstellar research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: ATLAS telescope, Chile</li>
    <li>Estimated size: 20-40 kilometres</li>
    <li>Speed: Over 50 kilometres per second</li>
    <li>Visible jet observed: August 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Two-Meter Twin Telescope, Canary Islands</li>
    <li>Number of anomalies reported: Eight</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. In August 2025, images taken by the Two-Meter Twin Telescope in the Canary Islands revealed a jet pointing towards the Sun. Following these observations, the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton spacecraft detected low-energy X-rays emitted as gases from 3I/ATLAS interacted with the solar wind.</p>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has reported eight anomalies related to 3I/ATLAS, including the unusual jet and its trajectory. While some scientists suggest that these anomalies could indicate new processes in interstellar comets, the scientific community urges caution and the need for further data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The jet and anti-tail should not contain streaming gas beyond 5,000 kilometres,” said Avi Loeb, emphasizing the importance of comparing old models with new evidence.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. While previous interstellar objects have exhibited typical cometary behavior, the sunward jet of 3I/ATLAS presents a unique challenge to existing models of cometary physics. The scientific community is keen to understand how these anomalies can inform broader theories about the formation of planetary systems and the behavior of icy bodies in outer space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion and moves farther from the solar system. The focus remains on gathering more data to clarify the object's nature and the underlying mechanisms of its unusual behavior.</p>
