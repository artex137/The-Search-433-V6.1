      <h2>Avi Loeb highlights a new strange anomaly in interstellar comet 3I/Atlas that raises fresh questions for scientists</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has captured the attention of scientists worldwide as Harvard professor Avi Loeb has identified a peculiar anomaly regarding its trajectory in relation to Jupiter. Loeb presented his findings during discussions about the comet’s close approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<p>This anomaly raises significant questions about the comet's behavior and its interaction with Jupiter's gravity. Authorities, including NASA scientists, are monitoring the comet's path using data collected from global observatories to further understand its trajectory and any unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Close Approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Distance from Jupiter:</strong> 53.445 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Jupiter's Hill Radius:</strong> 53.502 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Chance of Random Match:</strong> 1 in 26,000</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has been under observation for several months as it travels through our solar system. In March 2026, the comet will approach Jupiter closely, presenting a unique opportunity for scientists to study its characteristics.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb has identified an unusual alignment between the comet's path and Jupiter's Hill radius, suggesting a rare occurrence that warrants further investigation. The comet's trajectory has been affected by a "non-gravitational push," likely due to gas jets from the comet itself.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The match is so close that it is something worth paying attention to,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the significance of the comet's trajectory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We should not ignore such details,” Loeb added, emphasizing the importance of understanding the comet’s unusual behavior.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is only the third known object to enter our solar system from another star system, making its study critical for understanding interstellar objects. Previous observations have indicated that the comet exhibits a slight non-gravitational push, which complicates predictions about its path.</p>
<p>The upcoming approach to Jupiter presents an opportunity for spacecraft like NASA’s Juno to observe any potential anomalies or fragments associated with the comet’s journey.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches Jupiter in 2026, scientists will continue to monitor its path and gather data. Future observations may reveal new findings about the comet's behavior and its interaction with Jupiter’s gravitational field.</p>
