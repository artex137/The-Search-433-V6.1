      <h2>V-shaped UFO sighted nine lights above L.A…New unmanned drone experiment?</h2>

<p>A V-shaped unidentified flying object (UFO) has been spotted over Los Angeles, California, on September 28, 2025, at approximately 11:10 p.m. local time. Two residents reported seeing the object from their balcony and filmed it with their mobile phones. The sighting lasted about 25 minutes, and witnesses described the vehicle as having nine clear white lights on its hull.</p>

<p>This sighting has garnered attention due to its resemblance to the U.S. Air Force's F-117 stealth fighter, though it features more prominent lights. Authorities have noted that this incident marks the 34th V-shaped vehicle reported in the United States this year, according to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). The organization has documented several instances of similar sightings involving lights arranged on triangular or wedge-shaped structures.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 28, 2025, at around 11:10 p.m., two residents in Los Angeles observed a V-shaped object in the sky. They captured the event on their mobile phones, documenting the object for approximately 25 minutes. Following the sighting, the witnesses reported the incident to NUFORC on September 30, 2025.</p>

<p>The object was described as having nine white lights and moving erratically, including hovering in one spot before flying south rapidly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is more likely that it is an unmanned drone being tested by the U.S. government than an alien spacecraft,” an expert stated. “Many famous UFO events may actually be ground technology 30 to 40 years ahead of what we imagine it to be.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting is part of a broader trend of increasing reports of aerial phenomena across the United States. The NUFORC has recorded multiple instances of sightings involving aircraft with unusual light patterns, often described as triangular or wedge-shaped.
