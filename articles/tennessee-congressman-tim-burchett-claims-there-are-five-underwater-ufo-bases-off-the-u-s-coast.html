      <h2>Tennessee Congressman Tim Burchett Claims There Are Five Underwater UFO Bases Off the U.S. Coast</h2>

<p>Tennessee Congressman <strong>Tim Burchett</strong> has claimed that there are five underwater UFO bases off the U.S. coast. The assertion was made during a recent hearing overseen by Burchett on the House Oversight Committee, where video evidence was presented showing a UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon) deflecting a Hellfire missile over the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked interest and debate regarding the existence of such bases. Authorities and experts, including UFO researcher <strong>Dr. Michael Salla</strong>, are examining the implications of these assertions, though no concrete evidence has been provided to substantiate them.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Congressman Tim Burchett oversees the House Oversight Committee.</li>
    <li>Video evidence of a UAP was presented during the hearing.</li>
    <li>Dr. Michael Salla attended the hearing and shared testimony from an anonymous whistleblower.</li>

    <li>The alleged base is compared to an underwater Dubai.</li>
    <li>Burchett claims entities are coming from 5-6 deep water sites.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
