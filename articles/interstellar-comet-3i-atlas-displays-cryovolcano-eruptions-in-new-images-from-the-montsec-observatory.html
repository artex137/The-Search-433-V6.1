      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS displays cryovolcano eruptions in new images from the Montsec Observatory</h2>

<p>Spanish scientists have recorded cryovolcanic eruptions on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS at the Observatório Montsec in Catalunha, with observations taking place as the comet approached Sol in October 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the composition and chemical conditions of distant star systems. Researchers have noted that the activity of the comet has intensified, leading to new findings about its structure and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at approximately <strong>221,000 km/h</strong> in a hyperbolic orbit.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, at <strong>1.36 astronomical units</strong> from Sol.</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of the comet ranges from <strong>440 meters to 5.6 kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>Mass of the comet is over <strong>600 million metric tons</strong>.</li>
    <li>Comet will make its closest approach to Terra on December 19, 2025, at <strong>270 million kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted using the Telescópio Joan Oró and regional observatories in Espanha.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers first detected comet 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS system in Chile. Observations revealed its hyperbolic orbit, confirming its interstellar origin. Activity increased dramatically in October 2025, leading to the observation of cryovolcanic eruptions.</p>

<p>On October 29, 2025, perihelion occurred at 1.36 astronomical units from Sol. Images captured by the Telescópio Joan Oró showed high-resolution jets of gas and dust, revealing spiral structures on the comet's surface.</p>

<p>The comet's closest approach to Terra is scheduled for December 19, 2025, when it will be visible with amateur telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This discovery offers clues about chemical conditions in distant star systems,” said a researcher from the Observatório Montsec. “The cryovolcanic activity indicates a rich composition of ice and primitive materials.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS shares characteristics with trans-Neptunian objects and carbonaceous chondrites found in Antarctica. These materials are crucial for understanding the early solar system and the formation of planets. Previous studies have shown that interstellar comets can act as time capsules, preserving chemistry from other stellar systems.</p>

<p>Understanding comet 3I/ATLAS’s activity helps researchers propose future interceptor missions and enhances knowledge of potential risks associated with such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue until its total removal in 2026. Researchers aim to gather more data on its composition and behavior as it approaches Terra.</p>
