      <h2>Former US President Barack Obama comments on aliens during podcast</h2>

<p>Former US President Barack Obama has made headlines following his recent appearance on a podcast where he discussed the existence of aliens. The podcast, hosted by political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen, aired on February 14, 2026. Obama’s remarks have caused a stir online, with some claiming he "confirmed" the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Obama’s comments matter as they have reignited public interest and speculation about UFOs and government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. While many have interpreted his words as an endorsement of alien existence, a closer look reveals a more nuanced perspective.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Podcast aired on February 14, 2026.</li>
    <li>Obama stated aliens are "real" but have not been seen by him.</li>
    <li>He denied any government cover-up regarding aliens or UFOs.</li>
    <li>Comments delivered in a lighthearted manner.</li>
    <li>Obama has previously addressed UFOs in 2021, discussing military videos of unidentified aerial phenomena.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2026, Barack Obama appeared on Brian Tyler Cohen’s podcast. He was asked whether aliens are real, to which he responded affirmatively but jokingly noted that he has not seen any aliens and there are no hidden bases. This sparked widespread attention on social media.</p>

<p>In addition, an old clip from a 2015 appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" resurfaced, where Obama humorously claimed that aliens would not allow him to reveal their secrets. This clip has gone viral multiple times, but it has always been treated as a joke.</p>

<p>In 2021, Obama discussed Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) and acknowledged military videos showing unexplained objects, although he did not link them to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The universe is vast, and the possibility of life beyond Earth cannot be ruled out,” Obama said during the podcast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I was never briefed about secret alien bases or crashed UFOs,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Obama has addressed UFOs. His 2021 comments acknowledged military sightings but suggested they could be attributed to drones or atmospheric phenomena rather than aliens. His recent remarks align with his previous stance, emphasizing a lack of concrete evidence.</p>

<p>Social media has amplified the discussion, with varying interpretations of Obama's comments, yet no official confirmations of alien life have emerged.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no investigations or official actions planned related to Obama's remarks. The conversation surrounding UFOs and extraterrestrial life continues to evolve, but no new evidence or disclosures have been announced.</p>
