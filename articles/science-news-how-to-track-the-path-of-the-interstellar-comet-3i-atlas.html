      <h2>How to Track the Path of the Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS is no longer visible to the naked eye or typical backyard telescopes, but researchers continue to monitor its journey using powerful instruments. The comet is expected to remain observable for several more months, according to recent reports.</p>

<p>This ongoing visibility is significant for scientists who study the properties and origins of interstellar objects. Authorities and researchers are utilizing advanced telescopes such as Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to gain insights into the comet's characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is no longer visible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>Typical backyard telescopes cannot detect the comet.</li>
    <li>Powerful instruments like Hubble and JWST can observe the comet for several more months.</li>
    <li>Research on the comet's properties and origins is ongoing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by astronomers, leading to excitement and significant interest in its interstellar origin. As it approached the inner solar system, it became visible to amateur astronomers. However, as its brightness diminished, it ceased to be observable without professional-grade equipment.</p>

<p>Currently, the focus has shifted to utilizing advanced telescopes to monitor the comet's path and gather data on its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The journey of Comet 3I/ATLAS is far from over for researchers,” said an astronomer involved in the observations. “We still have the opportunity to learn a great deal from this interstellar visitor.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar objects to visit our solar system, providing a unique opportunity to study materials from beyond our solar system. Previous interstellar comets, such as 'Oumuamua, have sparked interest and research into their origins and the potential for similar objects in the future.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS with Hubble and JWST to gather more data. The findings could enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their role in the formation of solar systems.</p>
