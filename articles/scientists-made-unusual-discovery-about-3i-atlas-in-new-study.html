      <h2>Scientists made unusual discovery about 3I/ATLAS in new study</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected unusual water emissions from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traveling through our solar system. This discovery was made using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory during observations conducted in July and August 2025.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it may provide insights into the chemical composition of comets and the ingredients necessary for life. Researchers are examining the water emissions to better understand the nature of 3I/ATLAS and to compare it with other comets in the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Dates:</strong> July and August 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Sun:</strong> 2.9 times farther than Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Water Emission Rate:</strong> Roughly 40 kilograms per second</li>
    <li><strong>Active Surface Percentage:</strong> At least 8 percent</li>
    <li><strong>Published In:</strong> Astrophysical Journal Letters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July and August 2025, researchers at Auburn University, led by Zexi Xing, used the Swift telescope to observe 3I/ATLAS. They first detected the dim ultraviolet glow of hydroxyl (OH), a byproduct of water molecules breaking down due to sunlight. The team determined that the comet was leaking water at a rate comparable to a fire hose running at full blast.</p>

<p>These findings were published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, providing new insights into the object’s behavior and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we detect water — or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH — from an interstellar comet, we're reading a note from another planetary system. It tells us that the ingredients for life's chemistry are not unique to our own,” said Dennis Bodewits, co-author of the study and professor of physics at Auburn University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise. Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide. Now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn't expect it. Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars,” stated Zexi Xing, the study's lead researcher.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the latest in a series of interstellar comets that have challenged scientists' understanding of comet composition and behavior. Previous interstellar objects, such as Oumuamua and Borisov, exhibited distinct characteristics, with Oumuamua being dry and Borisov rich in carbon monoxide. The discovery of water emissions from 3I/ATLAS provides a new perspective in the study of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to further analyze its chemical composition and compare it with other comets. This ongoing research may enhance our understanding of the formation of planetary systems.</p>
