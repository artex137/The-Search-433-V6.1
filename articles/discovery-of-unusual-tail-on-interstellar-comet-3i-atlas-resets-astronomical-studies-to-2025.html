      <h2>Discovery of unusual tail on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS resets astronomical studies to 2025</h2>

<p>Japanese astronomers have discovered an unusual tail on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, as captured in new images on November 22, 2025. This finding challenges current understandings of celestial object formation and evolution outside our solar system.</p>

<p>The peculiar nature of the tail, which is compact and distinct from typical comet tails, has generated significant interest within the scientific community. Authorities are now prioritizing further investigations to understand the comet's unique characteristics and its implications for astrophysics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery made on November 22, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified.</li>
    <li>Comet travels at a speed of 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>Initial detection occurred in July 2025 by the ATLAS system.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun was approximately 1.4 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Future observations are planned for 2025, particularly using the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS astronomical warning system. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirmed that it is not bound to the Solar System and originated from interstellar space. The comet reached its perihelion in October 2025, coming within approximately 1.4 astronomical units of the Sun.</p>
<p>Following its perihelion, 3I/ATLAS continued its journey outward. Observations during its passage have provided valuable data to the scientific community, which is now focused on analyzing this information and planning future studies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The discovery of 3I/ATLAS's compact tail suggests a unique composition or degassing process, challenging our current models of cometary behavior,” said a representative from the Japanese astronomy team.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins a small group of interstellar objects, including the first discovered, 1I/’Oumuamua, in 2017, and the second, 2I/Borisov, in 2019. While 1I/’Oumuamua displayed no visible cometary activity, 2I/Borisov exhibited characteristics more aligned with traditional comets. The unique features of 3I/ATLAS place it as an intermediate case that can inform future studies on the diversity of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations scheduled for 2025 will focus on understanding the chemical and physical composition of 3I/ATLAS. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will play a crucial role in these investigations, which are expected to yield insights into the formation conditions of celestial bodies in other stellar systems.</p>
