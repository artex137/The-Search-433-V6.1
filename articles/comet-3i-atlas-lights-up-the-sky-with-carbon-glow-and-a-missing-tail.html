      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS lights up the sky with carbon glow, and a ‘missing’ tail</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has re-emerged in the night sky, displaying a green hue and an unusual absence of a visible tail. On Wednesday, November 5, Qicheng Zhang, a researcher at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, captured new images of the comet using the facility’s Discovery Telescope. The comet has resumed its journey into deep space after passing behind the sun.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as 3I/ATLAS is a confirmed interstellar object, likely originating from a distant stellar system. Astronomers are eager to study the comet’s chemical composition during its peak activity phase following its closest approach to the sun on October 29. Scientists are particularly interested in the comet's unique characteristics, including its carbon glow and the optical illusion surrounding its tail.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>New images were captured on November 5, 2023.</li>
    <li>Qicheng Zhang is a researcher at Lowell Observatory, Arizona.</li>
    <li>The comet may be up to three billion years older than our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 28, 2023, Qicheng Zhang and a colleague published findings indicating a rapid brightening of 3I/ATLAS before perihelion, noting a blue hue in its appearance. On October 29, the comet passed perihelion, marking its closest approach to the sun. Observations resumed on November 5, when Zhang captured images of the comet as it drifted northward from the northeastern horizon.</p>
<p>During these observations, Zhang noted the comet's distinctive green glow, attributed to diatomic carbon. The comet's tail, although not visible, was determined to exist but was positioned directly behind the comet, creating an optical illusion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet contains many large hydrocarbons — molecules made of hydrogen and carbon — which break apart when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun,” Zhang told Live Science. “The UV rays are destroying our DNA — which, like these hydrocarbons, are large, carbon-based molecules.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third recorded interstellar visitor. Its unique characteristics have captured the attention of researchers since its discovery. The comet’s journey offers insights into the materials that may exist in other stellar systems, furthering our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels away from the sun, with ongoing observations expected to provide more data on its chemical composition and behavior. Further studies will determine if the comet has released altered material due to its exposure to cosmic radiation.</p>
