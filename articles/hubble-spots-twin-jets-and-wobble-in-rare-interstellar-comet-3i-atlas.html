      <h2>Hubble Spots Twin Jets and Wobble in Rare Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed two distinct jets of material streaming from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes through our solar system, according to new images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope on December 12 and December 27, 2025. The comet is currently on its journey back into deep space after being first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the comet's internal structure and rotational dynamics. The twin jets indicate a highly organized emission process, which scientists believe is linked to the comet's rotation. Researchers are analyzing data from the observations to better understand the comet's behavior and properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Hubble captured images on December 12 and December 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object in our solar system.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, was on October 29, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected comet 3I/ATLAS in Chile. It was confirmed as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic trajectory. The comet passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, and Hubble captured new images showing its twin jets on December 12 and December 27, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The jets may originate near a pole of the comet that once faced the Sun before perihelion,” said Harvard physicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While the jets are intriguing, there is no threat to Earth from the comet,” experts noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to visit our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its twin-jet structure and observed wobble provide a unique opportunity for scientists to study the physical properties of materials formed around other stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are continuing to analyze the data from the Hubble observations to gain further insights into the comet's behavior and its implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
