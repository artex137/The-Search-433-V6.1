      <h2>Interstellar visitor sparks debate: Is Comet 3I/Atlas a threat from aliens or a natural wonder?</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar object, Comet 3I/Atlas, has been discovered hurtling through our solar system, igniting scientific debate about its nature and implications. The comet was identified on July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to this event.</p>

<p>This matter has drawn attention from both the scientific community and the public. NASA scientists assert that Comet 3I/Atlas is a natural phenomenon, while some researchers, notably Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, speculate it could be an artificial object with potential risks for Earth. Authorities are continuing to study the comet using ground and space telescopes to determine its characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Object Size:</strong> Up to 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide</li>
    <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> 130,000 mph (209,000 km/h)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>NASA Lead Scientist:</strong> Tom Statler</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered by the Atlas survey telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, NASA scientists began monitoring the comet, gathering data to assess its nature and trajectory. In a scientific paper published in July, Avi Loeb proposed that the comet could be an artificial object. NASA has since dismissed these claims, asserting that it behaves like a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “[If] future data will indicate the absence of a cometary tail, we will be faced with the tantalizing possibility that it did not inherit a random velocity in interstellar space but instead was sent towards the inner solar system by design,” Avi Loeb stated in a blog post.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of Comet 3I/Atlas is significant as it marks only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. This event provides researchers with a unique opportunity to study the composition and characteristics of celestial bodies from outside our solar system. The ongoing debate about the comet's nature reflects a broader interest in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches Mars, Jupiter, and Venus in the coming months. Scientists will analyze data from ground and space telescopes to further understand its behavior and characteristics.</p>
