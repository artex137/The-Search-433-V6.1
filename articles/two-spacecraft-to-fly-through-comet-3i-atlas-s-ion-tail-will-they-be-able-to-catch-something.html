      <h2>Two Spacecraft To Fly Through Comet 3I/ATLAS's Ion Tail</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper and the European Space Agency's Hera are set to potentially cross the ion tail of comet 3I/ATLAS in the coming weeks. The spacecraft will be positioned to enter the tail as the comet approaches its peak activity on October 29, 2023.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it offers a rare opportunity to study an interstellar comet's tail. However, Hera lacks the necessary instruments for in-situ measurements, while Europa Clipper may be able to conduct observations if conditions permit. The spacecraft will be in the vicinity of the ion tail from October 30 to November 6.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Spacecraft:</strong> NASA's Europa Clipper, ESA's Hera</li>
    <li><strong>Peak activity date:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Hera's observation period:</strong> October 25 to November 1</li>
    <li><strong>Europa Clipper's optimal observation period:</strong> October 30 to November 6</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 203 million kilometers (126 million miles)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has two tails: a dust tail and an ion tail. The ion tail, which is straighter and can extend for hundreds of millions of kilometers, is expected to be crossed by both spacecraft in late October 2023. Hera will be positioned to enter the ion tail first, followed by Europa Clipper.</p>

<p>On October 29, the comet will reach its peak activity, providing a unique chance for scientific study. If conditions are favourable, Europa Clipper could sample the ion tail between October 30 and November 6.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“My understanding is that because Hera is not equipped with any in-situ instruments, there is no opportunity to measure any properties of the comet’s tail as it passes through,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Europa Clipper has a rare opportunity to sample an interstellar object’s tail,” the authors of a recent paper noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The exploration of comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is an interstellar object. Previous missions have focused on the study of asteroids and comets within our solar system, but 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity for new scientific insights.</p>

<p>While Hera will not be able to collect data on the ion tail, the ESA mission JUICE will observe the comet on November 2 and November 25, contributing to ongoing research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is expected to assess the situation regarding Europa Clipper's observations, though responses have been delayed due to the current government shutdown and internal restructuring at JPL. Further updates will be provided as they become available.</p>
