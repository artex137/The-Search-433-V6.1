      <h2>Scientists identify comet 3I/ATLAS passing through Solar System</h2>

<p>Scientists have shared the clearest images of a mysterious celestial object, now identified as comet 3I/ATLAS, passing through the Solar System. The images were captured at the Gemini South Observatory in Chile and reveal the object moving towards the Sun at a speed of 221,000 kilometers per hour.</p>

<p>This identification matters as it provides insights into the formation of comets and planets in distant star systems. Authorities in the scientific community are now analyzing the findings to understand more about the object's composition and its implications for planetary formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Gemini South Observatory, Chile</li>
    <li>Speed: 221,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Notable features: Bright region around the nucleus and a tail extending opposite the Sun</li>
    <li>Research institutions involved: University of Lancashire, Imperial College London</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Scientists have been discussing the mysterious object for several months. The clear images obtained recently have confirmed its identity as a comet.</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Norris from the University of Lancashire provided insights into the images, stating that they reveal the characteristics of comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>Dr. Matthew Genge from Imperial College London noted the unique atmospheric composition of the object, highlighting its significance in understanding celestial formation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"These new images clearly reveal that '3I/ATLAS' is a comet," said Dr. Mark Norris from the University of Lancashire.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The atmosphere of '3I/ATLAS' contains more carbon dioxide and less water than comets on Earth," stated Dr. Matthew Genge from Imperial College London.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The identification of 3I/ATLAS adds to the body of knowledge regarding comets and their formation. Understanding the differences in atmospheric composition can provide clues about where the object originated and the conditions in its home star system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the comet's composition and its implications for planetary formation processes in distant star systems.</p>
