      <h2>Radio signal from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS puts NASA’s planetary defense on high alert</h2>

<p>The detection of an unusual radio signal from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has mobilized NASA’s planetary defense team and the global astronomical community. The comet, traveling at approximately 100,000 kilometers per hour, was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it provides a unique opportunity to study material from another star system. Authorities are actively monitoring the comet to understand its behavior and the origin of the radio emissions. Despite the mobilization of resources, NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have confirmed that there is no risk of collision with Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of detection:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Comet speed:</strong> 100,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Initial discovery:</strong> ATLAS system at Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Significant signal detection:</strong> October 24, 2025, by MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa</li>
    <li><strong>Signal frequency:</strong> 1.6 GHz</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS system in Chile identified interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Following this, NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) convened a team of experts in August 2025 to monitor the comet's unusual behavior. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected a distinct radio signal from the comet, prompting intensified observation efforts.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, before continuing its journey through interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a unique visitor that offers a rare opportunity to study the building blocks of planetary systems outside our own,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The signal detected is a classic signature of active comets, confirming the natural origin of the emissions,” stated an ESA scientist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed object from outside our solar system, following the detection of ‘Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov. Each of these interstellar visitors has provided valuable insights into the formation of planetary systems. The study of 3I/ATLAS will enhance our understanding of the chemical composition of comets and their behavior as they approach solar heat.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue as long as it remains within range of advanced telescopes, including the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. The data collected will help refine models of planetary system formation and the ejection of debris, contributing to a broader understanding of our universe.</p>
