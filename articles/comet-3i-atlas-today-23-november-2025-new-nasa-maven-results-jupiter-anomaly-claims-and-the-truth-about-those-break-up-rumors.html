      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Today (23 November 2025): New NASA MAVEN Results, Jupiter ‘Anomaly’ Claims and the Truth About Those Break-Up Rumors</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS continues to attract attention on Sunday, 23 November 2025, as new data from NASA's Mars missions provide insights into its composition. The comet's journey toward Jupiter has sparked claims of an “extraordinary anomaly,” while astronomers have debunked rumors regarding its potential breakup. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This information is significant as it enhances understanding of the comet, which is the third confirmed interstellar object found. NASA and other space agencies are actively monitoring its path and gathering data to learn more about its origins and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 23 November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 190 million miles (307 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> Expected in mid-December 2025 at about 170 million miles (270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Comet discovery:</strong> 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey</li>
    <li><strong>Current research:</strong> Data from NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft</li>
    <li><strong>Previous flyby:</strong> Close approach to Mars in early October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Next significant event:</strong> Crossing Jupiter's orbit in March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey, a network of robotic telescopes. It flew past Mars in early October 2025, allowing Mars-orbiting spacecraft to observe it closely. On 27 September 2025, NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft began capturing data on the comet, with results published on 23 November 2025.</p>
<p>As of this weekend, the comet is nearing a significant moment in its trajectory, with its closest approach to Earth expected in mid-December 2025. Following this, it will cross the orbit of Jupiter in March 2026 before continuing into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is actively outgassing gas and dust, displaying a coma, tail, and even multiple jets and an ‘anti-tail’ that are unusual but explainable within comet physics,” a NASA scientist stated, emphasizing the comet's active behaviour.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike ordinary comets, 3I/ATLAS travels on a hyperbolic trajectory, suggesting it originated from a distant planetary system. The scientific community is keen to study its chemical composition to understand more about planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to gather data on 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter and later disappears into interstellar space. Observations from multiple missions will provide a comprehensive view of the comet's characteristics before it leaves our solar system.</p>
