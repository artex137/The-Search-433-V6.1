      <h2>NASA releases new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has released new photographs and videos of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first observed in our solar system on July 1, 2023. The comet, discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</p>

<p>This new release is significant as it provides a closer look at an object that offers insights into the formation of worlds beyond our solar system. Astronomers believe that interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS carry clues about planetary systems that differ greatly from our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>It made its closest approach to Earth in October 2023, passing about 228 million kilometres from the sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 20 km wide and travels at a speed of 60 km per second relative to the sun.</li>
    <li>NASA collaborated with 20 mission teams to capture the images of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The images were released after a delay due to the U.S. government shutdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the ATLAS telescope in Chile first spotted 3I/ATLAS. Its unusual trajectory raised suspicions of its interstellar origin, which was later confirmed by astronomers globally. The comet made its closest approach to the sun in October. NASA has since captured and released images of the comet over the past several weeks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What makes interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS so extraordinary is their absolutely foreign nature,” said the European Space Agency (ESA). “They are remnants of other planetary systems, carrying with them clues about the formation of worlds far beyond our own.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object observed in our solar system, following the discoveries of two other objects in 2017 and 2019. These interstellar visitors are unique as they originate from outside our solar system, offering a rare glimpse into the broader galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Further analysis of the images and data collected will provide insights into the comet's composition and characteristics.</p>
