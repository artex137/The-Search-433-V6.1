      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet Turns Green and Hides Tail</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has turned green and appears to have lost its tail, according to new images from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. These observations were made on November 5, 2025, as the comet moved away from the Sun after its closest approach on October 29, 2025. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has attracted significant attention from scientists. Researchers have explained that the green glow results from ultraviolet reactions with carbon molecules, while the tail is still present but aligned directly behind the comet from Earth's perspective. Understanding these aspects of 3I/ATLAS enhances knowledge of its chemical and physical behavior as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed from Lowell Observatory in Arizona.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet is moving away from the Sun at over 210,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Discovered by NASA’s ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Green glow attributed to diatomic carbon formed under UV light.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA’s ATLAS telescope in Chile first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet's perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, allowing scientists to study its gases and surface materials. On October 31, Qicheng Zhang captured images of the comet during morning twilight. The latest observations were made on November 5, 2025, revealing the comet's green hue and apparent lack of a tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The green color comes from hydrocarbon molecules breaking apart under ultraviolet light,” said Qicheng Zhang, a researcher at the Lowell Observatory. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The tail is still there but positioned directly behind the comet from our viewpoint,” Zhang added, explaining the visual phenomenon.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever detected, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Scientists believe it may be around 3 billion years older than our solar system, providing valuable insights into the early universe. The comet's discovery has sparked interest, with some speculation on social media regarding its nature, which astronomers have confirmed as a natural interstellar body.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. The comet remains visible in the morning sky during November and December 2025, and astronomers recommend using telescopes to observe it during this period.</p>
