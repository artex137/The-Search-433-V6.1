      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery Deepens: 'Untouched Cosmic Artifact' Erupts With Ice</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered that Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object first detected in July 2025, may be erupting with active, icy cryovolcanoes, according to a new pre-print study. This comet, which is travelling at speeds peaking around 246,000 km/h, presents a unique opportunity to examine materials from which other star systems are built.</p>

<p>The findings challenge existing theories about comet formation and suggest that 3I/ATLAS may not be a simple ball of ice but a complex geological body. Researchers from the California Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland have conducted extensive observations to document the comet's unusual surface activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the second interstellar comet ever tracked.</li>
    <li>It was first detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope network.</li>
    <li>The comet reaches speeds of approximately 246,000 km/h at its closest approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>It has a highly hyperbolic orbit with an eccentricity of about 6.1.</li>
    <li>The study detailing its findings is currently awaiting peer review.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025. Since its discovery, astronomers have monitored its trajectory and surface activity. In recent months, researchers have recorded a significant increase in brightness, indicating a possible eruption across its water-ice surface layer as it approached the Sun.</p>
<p>The comet's brightness surged when it reached approximately 2.5 astronomical units from the Sun, suggesting cryovolcanism may be occurring.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar visitors like 3I/ATLAS continue to challenge and refine our understanding of planetary-system formation and the chemical evolution of small bodies,” the study's authors stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019, both of which were the first interstellar objects identified. The pristine nature of 3I/ATLAS, having spent billions of years in the interstellar medium, offers a unique perspective on cometary science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the study awaits peer review, researchers will continue to investigate the implications of cryovolcanism on 3I/ATLAS and its potential to reshape existing models of comet formation.</p>
