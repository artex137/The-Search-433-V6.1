      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals CO2-rich composition and remote origins</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, has been confirmed as the third interstellar object in the Solar System. It follows a hyperbolic trajectory and reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers at NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), who have been monitoring the comet to analyze its unique composition and behavior. The comet's high carbon dioxide output suggests it formed under cold conditions in another star system, providing insights into planetary formation beyond our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 30, 2025, at 1.4 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Initial speed: 58 km/s; speed at perihelion: 246 km/s.</li>
    <li>Minimum distance to Earth: 1.8 AU in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Diameter of nucleus estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 km.</li>
    <li>Comet displays an antisolar tail of 56,000 km recorded in August 2025.</li>
    <li>Apparent magnitude reached 9.8 in the constellation of Virgem in November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected Comet 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Initial observations revealed a reddish coma, indicating carbon-rich dust. By October 3, 2025, ESA's missions had observed the comet from 29 million km away from Mars. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, where it was recorded travelling at 246 km/s. As of November 2025, the comet's apparent magnitude was recorded at 9.8.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The abundance of CO2 suggests the formation under cold conditions of another star system,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the only other confirmed interstellar comets were 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of these objects is crucial for understanding the chemical diversity of comets and the processes involved in planetary formation in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ESA’s Juice mission plans to conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS in December, focusing on its post-perihelion state. Astronomers expect the comet will dim below magnitude 12 by December, which will limit future observations.</p>
