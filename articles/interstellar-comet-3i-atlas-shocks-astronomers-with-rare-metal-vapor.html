      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shocks astronomers with rare metal vapor</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected glowing nickel vapor in the atmosphere of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, marking a significant discovery in the field of astronomy. The detection occurred using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, at a distance of nearly four times that between the Earth and the Sun. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding could reshape our understanding of the chemistry of distant star systems. Researchers have observed that the nickel’s presence lacks a corresponding signature of iron, which has puzzled scientists. The team, led by researchers from Chile and the United States, believes the metal may be released from molecules that break apart when exposed to sunlight, rather than through direct heating, which is typically expected.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery made using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile.</li>
    <li>Nickel vapor detected at a distance of approximately 150 million kilometres from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching its closest point to the Sun on October 29.</li>
    <li>Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) support the findings.</li>
    <li>Unusually high amounts of carbon dioxide found in the comet’s gas cloud.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The detection of nickel vapor in the atmosphere of 3I/ATLAS was announced recently by a team of astronomers. The observations were made with the VLT, which has provided important data about the comet's chemical composition. As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, astronomers expect increased activity that may reveal new chemical signatures.</p>

<p>Prior to this discovery, 3I/ATLAS was already noted for its unusual characteristics, similar to other interstellar visitors like ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The ongoing observations aim to draw comparisons with these previous objects to better understand their origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of nickel without iron raises questions about the processes at work in the comet’s atmosphere,” said a lead researcher involved in the study. “This could indicate a different mechanism for metal vaporization than we previously understood.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of nickel vapor is significant as it represents one of the first instances of metallic elements being observed escaping from an interstellar object at such a great distance from the Sun. Previous interstellar objects have sparked interest in the chemical composition of materials that build planets, with scientists hoping to learn how these materials vary across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the inner solar system, astronomers plan to monitor its activity closely. They aim to gather more data on its chemical signatures before it disappears into interstellar space again.</p>
