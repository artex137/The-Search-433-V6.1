      <h2>Putin responds to alien life question regarding 3I/ATLAS comet</h2>

<p>Vladimir Putin has responded to questions about the existence of aliens during an event on December 19 in Moscow. The Russian president was asked about the 3I/ATLAS comet, which is currently being tracked as it approaches Earth, reaching a distance of approximately 167 million miles this month. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this event.</p>

<p>This inquiry is significant as it highlights ongoing public interest in extraterrestrial life and the scientific observations surrounding the 3I/ATLAS comet. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring the comet's trajectory, which is set to pass by Jupiter in March 2026. The comet is expected to continue to generate interest as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of Putin's comments: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance of 3I/ATLAS from Earth: approximately 167 million miles</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to Jupiter: March 2026</li>
    <li>Time taken for 3I/ATLAS to reach our solar system: approximately 800 million years</li>
    <li>NASA's acting administrator: Sean Duffy</li>
    <li>Origin of 3I/ATLAS: thicker part of the Milky Way galaxy's disk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2023, during a public event in Moscow, Vladimir Putin was questioned about the 3I/ATLAS comet and the possibility of alien life. The president made light of the situation, suggesting the information should remain “strictly between us” and joking that the comet is Russia’s “secret weapon.”</p>

<p>Following Putin's remarks, Sean Duffy, NASA’s acting administrator, reiterated that there is “no threat to life” from the comet and dismissed any speculation regarding alien origins. The comet has been tracked as it journeys through the solar system, with scientists noting its significant age and origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No aliens, no threat to life,” said Sean Duffy, acting NASA administrator, addressing concerns about the 3I/ATLAS comet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Simply put, 3I/ATLAS is among the elders in our cosmic block,” stated Harvard physicist Avi Loeb, discussing the comet's origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet is one of three interstellar objects currently being observed, with its origins tracing back to an older section of the Milky Way galaxy. This area typically contains older stars, suggesting that 3I/ATLAS could be older than our 4.6 billion-year-old Sun. Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also sparked interest regarding their origins and the potential for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor the 3I/ATLAS comet as it approaches its closest point to Earth and its eventual passage by Jupiter. Scientific observations and studies will likely expand as the comet travels through the solar system.</p>
