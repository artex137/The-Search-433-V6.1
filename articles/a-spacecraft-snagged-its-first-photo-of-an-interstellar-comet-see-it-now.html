      <h2>Spacecraft Capture First Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>On Friday, the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express photographed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it made its closest approach to Mars, passing within 19 million miles of the planet. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant because 3I/ATLAS is a true outsider, originating from another star system. Astronomers have noted that it will not be captured by the sun's gravity and is only passing through our solar system. Researchers aim to gather more data about the comet as it approaches the sun, where it may become more active.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed within 19 million miles of Mars on Friday.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope on July 1.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at 137,000 mph.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be approximately 170 million miles away.</li>
    <li>ExoMars captured images of the comet; Mars Express did not succeed in obtaining clear photos.</li>
    <li>ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft will attempt to observe the comet next month.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System discovered 3I/ATLAS. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on Friday, prompting the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express to capture images. The ExoMars orbiter successfully photographed the comet, while Mars Express struggled with exposure times.</p>

<p>As the comet nears the sun, it is expected to become more active, potentially brightening and revealing more details about its structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was a very challenging observation,” said Nick Thomas, who leads the ExoMars camera team. “The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar comet, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Astronomers believe 3I/ATLAS may originate from an older region of the galaxy populated by much older stars, suggesting it could be over 7 billion years old, nearly twice the age of our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After emerging from the sun's glare next month, ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft will attempt to observe 3I/ATLAS, with hopes of capturing detailed images and data as the comet becomes more active.</p>
