      <h2>Farewell, Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has become faint and difficult to observe as it moves through the constellation Cancer, following its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. The comet is currently located approximately 2–3 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun.</p>

<p>This development is significant for astronomers and amateur stargazers who have followed 3I/ATLAS since its discovery. Observations made during its close approach have provided valuable insights into its composition and behavior. As the comet moves further away, it will become increasingly challenging to study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Currently located in the constellation Cancer, west of the Beehive Cluster (M44).</li>
    <li>Shining at around 14th magnitude, visible only through large telescopes.</li>
    <li>Passed perihelion in late October 2025, approximately 1.4 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Expected to pass near Jupiter in March 2026 at about 0.36 AU.</li>
    <li>Will cross Saturn’s orbit in July 2026 and Uranus’ orbit in April 2027.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. It quickly garnered attention as it approached the inner Solar System. The comet reached perihelion in late October 2025, becoming one of the most observed comets in history. As it moves outbound, it is now positioned for a close encounter with Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<p>The comet has been studied by various astronomical instruments, including ground-based telescopes and space observatories like Hubble and James Webb. As of now, it is fading from view, with professional telescopes continuing to monitor it until it becomes too faint to observe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object approaching from the depths of space was just a chunk of dirty, dusty, ancient ice - a comet,” said an unnamed astronomer, addressing misconceptions about 3I/ATLAS being an alien spacecraft. “It is a special comet, a comet from another star.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as one of the first interstellar comets observed in our Solar System. Its passage has sparked interest and speculation, particularly regarding its origins and characteristics. Previous interstellar objects have been detected, but 3I/ATLAS has provided a unique opportunity for study due to its close approach.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey toward the outer Solar System, professional astronomers will monitor its trajectory and behavior. Once it fades from view, the search will begin for the next interstellar object, with automated surveys expected to play a key role in future discoveries.</p>
