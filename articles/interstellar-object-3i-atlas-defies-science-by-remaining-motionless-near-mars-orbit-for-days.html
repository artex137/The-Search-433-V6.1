      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/Atlas defies science by remaining motionless near Mars’ orbit for days</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/Atlas has exhibited unusual behavior by remaining nearly motionless for several days while passing through the orbit of Mars, according to the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA. This rare astronomical event has mobilized the global scientific community and has not resulted in any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This phenomenon raises important questions about the forces acting in deep space. NASA has confirmed the validity of the event and is currently analyzing data from a global network of observatories to better understand this anomaly. The findings could lead to significant advancements in the understanding of celestial dynamics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Location: Near Mars' orbit</li>
    <li>Duration of immobility: Several days</li>
    <li>Date of observation: January 2026</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: NASA, ESA</li>
    <li>Size estimates: Core diameter between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated age: Approximately 10 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In January 2026, NASA telescopes and probes recorded the unusual behavior of 3I/Atlas as it approached Mars. The object, typically expected to maintain high speed due to its hyperbolic trajectory, exhibited a pause in its movement that challenged existing celestial mechanics.</p>

<p>NASA quickly ruled out instrumental failure and confirmed the anomaly. This led to an extensive analysis of data collected from various observatories, marking 3I/Atlas as a significant subject for ongoing research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The temporary stoppage of 3I/Atlas has opened a new field of investigation into the forces acting in deep space,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Current models of orbital simulation must now incorporate non-gravitational interactions, as this event demonstrates the limitations of our understanding,” noted an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/Atlas represents a direct challenge to existing orbital models. Previous interstellar objects have not shown similar immobility, making this incident unprecedented. The implications for future studies of celestial bodies are significant, as they may require new frameworks for understanding their dynamics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After resuming its movement, 3I/Atlas continues on its path through the solar system, with its perihelion expected on October 29th. Scientists will closely monitor the object during this phase to gather more data on its composition and behavior.</p>
