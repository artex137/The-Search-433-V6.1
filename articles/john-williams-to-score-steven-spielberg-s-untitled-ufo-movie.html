      <h2>John Williams to Score Steven Spielberg’s Untitled UFO Movie</h2>

<p>John Williams, 93, has teamed up with director Steven Spielberg for an untitled UFO film set for release in June 2025. Damian Woetzel, president of Juilliard, confirmed that Williams is currently in Los Angeles working with Spielberg in the studio.</p>

<p>This collaboration is significant as it marks the 30th time the two have worked together. Williams, who previously announced his retirement from film composing in January 2023, has continued to contribute to Spielberg’s projects despite his earlier claims. The film is expected to draw on themes from Spielberg’s earlier work, according to recent comments from the cast and screenwriter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Film title: Untitled UFO film (working title: "Disclosure/The Dish")</li>
    <li>Release date: June 2025</li>
    <li>Composer: John Williams</li>
    <li>Director: Steven Spielberg</li>
    <li>Screenwriter: David Koepp</li>
    <li>Cast includes: Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, and Wyatt Russell</li>
    <li>Production wrapped: June 2023</li>
    <li>Williams' Oscar nominations: 52, an all-time record</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In January 2023, John Williams announced his retirement from film composing, stating that "The Fabelmans" and "Indiana Jones 5" would be his final films. However, in October 2023, it was confirmed that he is collaborating again with Spielberg on the UFO film. Production for the film quietly wrapped in June 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Yes, it is like a sci-fi… Well, I don’t know. I’m not supposed to say […] It does harken back to maybe a different tone than [what he’s done lately]. Something he used to do that he hasn’t done for a little bit,” said Josh O’Connor, one of the film’s actors.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This film represents a return to the themes and tones of Spielberg's earlier works, such as "E.T." and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." Spielberg's last film, "The Fabelmans," received critical acclaim and won a Toronto audience award, following the success of "West Side Story," which earned seven Oscar nominations in 2021.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>With production completed, the focus will shift to post-production and marketing as the release date approaches in June 2025.</p>
