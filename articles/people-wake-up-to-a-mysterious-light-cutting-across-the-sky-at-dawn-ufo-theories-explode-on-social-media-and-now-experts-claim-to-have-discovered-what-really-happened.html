      <h2>People wake up to mysterious light in southern Australia; experts link it to rocket launch</h2>

<p>A mysterious light appeared in the dawn sky over southern Australia at 6 a.m. on Friday, following the launch of the Ariane 6 rocket at 3:15 a.m. that carried 32 Amazon satellites from French Guiana. The light, described as two beams spinning together, has not caused any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>The phenomenon has sparked significant speculation about UFOs on social media. Authorities and experts have stepped in to clarify the situation, suggesting a connection between the light and the recent rocket launch. This incident has captured public interest, particularly given a 2023 survey indicating that a third of Australians believe in extraterrestrial contact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Light spotted at 6 a.m. on Friday in southern Australia.</li>
    <li>Ariane 6 rocket launched at 3:15 a.m. Adelaide time.</li>
    <li>Rocket carried 32 satellites for the Amazon constellation.</li>
    <li>Sightings occurred in Strathalbyn, Seaview, and Largs Bay.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities reported.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At 3:15 a.m. on Friday, the Ariane 6 rocket launched from the European Space Centre in French Guiana. This event coincided with the sightings of the mysterious light in southern Australia three hours later, at 6 a.m.</p>

<p>In the hours following the light's appearance, social media exploded with theories ranging from UFOs to more whimsical explanations, such as a pigeon in a luminous vest. This prompted experts to analyze the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite initial speculation and online buzz, the most likely explanation for the mysterious light in the Australian sky is linked to the space launch that occurred hours earlier,” experts stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: “Amazon, your order has been delivered,” and noted that the Ariane 6 had taken off for the first time with four auxiliary boosters, marking a significant achievement for the European space program.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a trend of increased public interest in UFO sightings and space launches. A 2023 survey revealed that a significant portion of the Australian population is open to the idea of extraterrestrial life. The speculation around this light mirrors previous incidents where space activities have generated similar excitement and theories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the light phenomenon are ongoing, but experts have largely attributed it to the Ariane 6 launch. Further analysis may provide additional clarity, though no official deadlines for inquiries have been disclosed.</p>
