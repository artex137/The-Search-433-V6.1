      <h2>Comet C/2025 V1 Borisov Discovered Between 3I/ATLAS and Earth</h2>

<p>A new comet, named C/2025 V1 Borisov, has been discovered between interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS and Earth. Astronomer Gennadiy Borisov found the object on November 2, 2025, and it is set to make its closest approach to Earth on November 11, coming within 64 million miles (about 103 million kilometers).</p>

<p>The discovery of C/2025 V1 Borisov is significant because it raises questions about its origin and trajectory. Officials from various astronomical agencies are currently studying its path and characteristics, as initial observations suggest it likely formed within our solar system, not from interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> C/2025 V1 Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered by:</strong> Gennadiy Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Discovery:</strong> November 2, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> November 11, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth at Closest Approach:</strong> 64 million miles (103 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion (closest point to the Sun):</strong> November 16, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Apparent Magnitude:</strong> 13.8</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Location:</strong> Virgo constellation, visible before sunrise</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The following events outline the discovery and characteristics of C/2025 V1 Borisov:</p>
<ul>
    <li>November 2, 2025: Gennadiy Borisov discovers C/2025 V1 Borisov.</li>
    <li>November 11, 2025: The comet will make its closest approach to Earth.</li>
    <li>November 16, 2025: C/2025 V1 Borisov will reach its perihelion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"If C/2025 V1 did not use any form of non-gravitational propulsion, it could not be connected to 3I/ATLAS," said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, clarifying the comet's origins.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Gennadiy Borisov is known for discovering the interstellar object “Comet Borisov” in 2019, which was the second known interstellar visitor to our solar system after ‘Oumuamua. C/2025 V1 Borisov follows the tradition of naming comets after their discoverers. While some observers have speculated about a connection between C/2025 V1 and 3I/ATLAS, scientists have dismissed these claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor C/2025 V1 Borisov's trajectory and characteristics as it approaches the Sun and Earth. Further studies will help clarify its origin and contribute to ongoing research into solar system formation.</p>
