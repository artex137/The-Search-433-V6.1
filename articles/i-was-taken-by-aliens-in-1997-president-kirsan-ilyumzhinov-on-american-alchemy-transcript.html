      <h2>Former Kalmykian President Claims UFO Abduction in 1997</h2>

<p>President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov has recounted his alleged abduction by extraterrestrial beings from his Moscow apartment in September 1997 during an interview on the American Alchemy Podcast on December 15, 2025. Ilyumzhinov, who served as the president of Kalmykia and the World Chess Federation, described a vivid experience of being taken aboard a spacecraft by tall beings dressed in yellow suits, where he communicated with them telepathically.</p>

<p>This account has attracted attention due to Ilyumzhinov's prominent status and the implications of such claims. Authorities and researchers are now examining the potential significance of his testimony in the broader context of UFO sightings and government disclosures regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li><strong>Duration of disappearance:</strong> Approximately one hour</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 1997, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was preparing to return to Kalmykia from a business trip in Moscow. On the night of his alleged abduction, he reported feeling drawn to a glowing tunnel outside his apartment window. He described walking through this tunnel and entering a large spacecraft, where he encountered beings who communicated with him telepathically.</p>

<p>After about an hour, Ilyumzhinov reportedly reappeared in his apartment, having vanished from a locked and guarded flat, prompting his chief of staff to confirm his sudden return.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I saw someone, or rather some sound was coming. My apartment is on the top floor... There were no nearby balconies to move from one to another.” 
    — Kirsan Ilyumzhinov
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “They said, ‘We’ll be back soon.’” 
    — Kirsan Ilyumzhinov describing his communication with the beings
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Ilyumzhinov's claims come amidst a growing public interest in UFOs and government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. His position as a former head of state lends weight to his story, as it aligns with a series of recent disclosures from various governments about UFO encounters. This incident raises questions about the historical context of such experiences among political figures and the implications for global understanding of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigators and researchers are likely to review Ilyumzhinov's account for further insights into UFO phenomena and the potential for future disclosures from world leaders regarding extraterrestrial encounters.</p>
