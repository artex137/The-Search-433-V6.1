      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-24 15:47 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS detected by Vera C. Rubin Observatory</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, first discovered in July 2025, has made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and is currently heading towards the outskirts of the solar system. It is only the third interstellar object observed by humanity, following 1I/’Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2017 and 2019, respectively. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, equipped with advanced technology, claims it can detect up to 50 interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS in the coming years. This capability is significant as research indicates there could be over 10,000 interstellar objects within the orbit of Neptune alone. The observatory's Legacy Survey of Space & Time (LSST) will enhance the understanding of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Vera C. Rubin Observatory can detect between 5 and 50 interstellar objects over the next decade.</li>
    <li>Over 10,000 interstellar objects are estimated to exist within Neptune's orbit.</li>
    <li>The observatory has captured over 2,000 new asteroids in a single summer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered. It made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, during which time the Vera C. Rubin Observatory revealed its ability to detect numerous interstellar objects. The observatory's Legacy Survey of Space & Time is set to begin, enhancing the search for interstellar objects in the coming decade.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The best estimates suggest Rubin should detect between 5 and 50 ISOs over its 10 year survey, stemming from the still-limited empirical constraints on the ISO population,” said a spokesperson from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The reason Rubin will be great at finding them is because it can image the entire visible sky to great depth, and do so repeatedly – allowing it to identify the one thing that makes objects passing through our solar system stand out from the background: their motion,” the spokesperson explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects had been detected. The discovery of these objects raises questions about their frequency and origin, prompting further investigation into the population of interstellar objects. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to significantly increase the number of known asteroids, potentially identifying nearly three times as many as currently documented.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will continue its Legacy Survey of Space & Time, with expectations to gather significant data on interstellar objects and asteroids over the next ten years. Researchers will analyze findings to enhance understanding of potential threats and opportunities for space exploration.</p>
