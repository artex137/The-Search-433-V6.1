      <h2>Elon Musk thinks the mysterious object flying through space "could be alien"</h2>
<p>Elon Musk has claimed that a mysterious object, known as 3I/ATLAS, flying through space “could be alien.” He made the remarks during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience on November 17, 2025. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this object.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>Musk's comments have sparked renewed interest and concern regarding the object, which is currently traveling through the Solar System at speeds of 130,000 km/h. The implications of its potential collision with Earth have led to discussions among scientists and space agencies about the need for further observation and analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: 130,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors: Oumuamua (2017) and Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>Potential risk: Musk stated it could "obliterate a continent" if it hit Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. It is the third confirmed interstellar visitor in history. On October 30, it swung past the Sun, during which telescopes noted unusual non-gravitational accelerations and detected a mysterious radio signal.</p>
<p>On November 17, 2025, Musk discussed the object on the Joe Rogan Experience, expressing uncertainty about its nature and warning of the potential dangers it could pose to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It may be an unusual comet or asteroid, but it could be alien - I don’t know,” Musk said during the podcast.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If it hit Earth, it would obliterate a continent. Maybe worse. Probably kill most of human life. If not all of us,” Musk warned.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Professor Avi Loeb commented on the anomalies observed, stating he could “never fully rule out” an alien craft, rating it a two on his UFO scale, meaning “meriting attention.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around 3I/ATLAS follows previous incidents involving interstellar objects, such as Oumuamua and Borisov, which have also raised questions about the nature of such visitors to our Solar System. The scientific community continues to explore the implications of these encounters, particularly in relation to the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System. There are ongoing discussions about potential observations and analyses that could provide further insights into the object's nature before its closest approach.
