      <h2>Physicists Open a “Message in a Bottle” From Interstellar Space</h2>

<p>Physicists have opened a sample from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, marking a significant milestone in space exploration. The event occurred on December 17, 2025, at a research facility in Auburn, Alabama. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is crucial as it offers insights into the composition of interstellar materials and the origins of our solar system. Researchers from Auburn University have commenced detailed analyses of the sample to determine its chemical makeup and any potential implications for understanding cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: December 17, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Auburn University, Alabama</li>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth when observed: 365 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Research agency: Auburn University</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet 3I/ATLAS as it traveled through space. This marked the first significant observation of the comet at a distance of 365 million kilometers from Earth.</p>

<p>The sample from the comet was collected and transported to Auburn University, where physicists prepared for analysis. On December 17, 2025, the team successfully opened the sample, initiating a series of tests to explore its properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This sample is like a time capsule from the early solar system,” said a lead researcher at Auburn University. “We are excited to uncover the secrets it holds.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2020 and has since been a subject of interest for scientists studying interstellar objects. Previous investigations of similar objects have provided valuable information about the materials present in the early solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers at Auburn University will conduct further analyses of the comet sample over the coming months. They aim to publish their findings in scientific journals to share insights with the broader scientific community.</p>
