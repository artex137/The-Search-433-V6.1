      <h2>Concern over latest information from 3I/ATLAS: telescope images have left scientists puzzled</h2>

<p>Scientists have expressed confusion over new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first sighted on July 1, 2025. The comet, measuring between 20 and 30 kilometers, originates from outside the Solar System. Javier Santaolalla, a Spanish physicist and engineer, shared insights about the comet on his TikTok account.</p>

<p>The latest findings from the Hubble and James Webb telescopes have raised questions about the comet's unusual composition. Authorities, including astronomers, are preparing for further observations as 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its closest point to Earth, approximately 240 million kilometers away, at the end of October.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first sighted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It measures between 20 and 30 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>It will pass within 240 million kilometers of Earth at the end of October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has shown an unusually high presence of CO2, 16 times higher than normal.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects include Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. In August 2025, the Hubble and James Webb telescopes captured images of the comet, revealing its unique composition. Javier Santaolalla discussed these findings in a video posted on TikTok, highlighting the unusual CO2 levels observed in the comet's coma. As of now, scientists are preparing for closer observations as the comet approaches Earth later this month.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The composition of its coma is truly unique. The image taken by James Webb reveals the presence of CO2 in an amount 16 times higher than usual,” said Santaolalla.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This CO2-water ratio has only been seen once before in Earth’s history,” he added, referring to a similar discovery with comet C-2016R2.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through the Solar System, following Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The presence of unusual gas compositions in celestial bodies has prompted ongoing discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to study its composition and trajectory. Further observations are expected to provide more clarity on the comet's mysterious features.</p>
