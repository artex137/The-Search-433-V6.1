      <h2>'Potentially hostile alien threat' pictured as interstellar object officially declared a 'threat'</h2>

<p>NASA has officially listed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as a threat due to its unusual behaviour since its discovery in July. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has added the comet to its list of threats, marking the first time an interstellar object has been included on this list.</p>

<p>This designation is significant as it reflects the growing concerns among scientists regarding the object’s unpredictable path and unique characteristics, which pose challenges for planetary defence strategies. NASA has been working to enhance detection capabilities for space objects in preparation for potential threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery: July 2023</li>
    <li>Designation: Listed as a threat by the IAWN</li>
    <li>First interstellar object added to IAWN threat list</li>
    <li>Notable feature: Appears to have an 'anti-tail'</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023, sparking debate within the space community regarding its nature. Since then, it has been monitored closely due to its unusual behaviour. Earlier this week, the IAWN officially added the comet to its threat list, citing unique challenges in predicting its trajectory.</p>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has raised questions about the object's classification, suggesting there may be a 30 to 40 percent chance that it is not a naturally formed comet. He noted that the object exhibited a tail reversal, which he likened to the behaviour of an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We cannot infer the true nature of 3I/ATLAS from the skin layer it has shed so far,” said Avi Loeb. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If the object were an alien spacecraft slowing down, and the anti-tail represented braking thrust, this shift from anti-tail to tail would be entirely expected,” he added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The addition of 3I/ATLAS to the IAWN threat list highlights the ongoing efforts to improve detection and monitoring of space objects. The IAWN aims to prepare for potential threats posed by asteroids and comets, especially those that can approach Earth.</p>

<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the IAWN had not included any interstellar objects on its list, which underscores the significance of this event in the field of planetary defence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and assess its trajectory as part of the Comet Astrometry Campaign. Further investigations are expected to focus on understanding the object’s characteristics and potential implications for planetary defence.</p>
