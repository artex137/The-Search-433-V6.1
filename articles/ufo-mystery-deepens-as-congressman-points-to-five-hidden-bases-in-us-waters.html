      <h2>UFO mystery deepens as Congressman points to five hidden bases in US waters</h2>

<p>Tennessee Republican Congressman <strong>Tim Burchett</strong> has claimed that extraterrestrial beings might occupy five or six submerged bases off the United States’ coastline. The remarks were made during a casual conversation with UFO researcher <strong>Red Panda Koala</strong> and were shared in a video on X on September 17, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these claims.</p>

<p>This statement has reignited discussions in UFO communities and raised questions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Burchett, a member of the House Oversight Committee, has expressed his concerns about the implications of these sightings, particularly those reported by naval personnel who have encountered mysterious underwater crafts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Burchett mentioned the existence of five or six submerged bases.</li>
    <li>The video of his comments was shared on September 17, 2025.</li>
    <li>He highlighted naval sightings of underwater crafts traveling at speeds exceeding 640 km/h.</li>
    <li>The claims arose during a House Oversight hearing on September 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>Dr. Michael Salla cited the Bahamas as a possible location for these bases.</li>
    <li>The U.S. Navy’s Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) is located near the Bahamas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 9, 2025, a House Oversight hearing took place where whistleblowers spoke about encounters with UAPs. Burchett’s remarks regarding submerged extraterrestrial bases were made public on September 17, 2025, during a video conversation with Red Panda Koala. Following this, Dr. Michael Salla discussed potential locations for these bases on September 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have naval personnel telling me that we have sightings … of these underwater crafts that they’re chasing,” Burchett stated, expressing exasperation at the speed of these crafts compared to conventional submarines.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Credible whistleblowers, including senior military and executive branch officials, have confirmed underwater bases,” Salla mentioned, highlighting the AUTEC facility's significance.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Burchett’s statements come amid a growing interest in UAPs on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers pushing for the declassification of UFO files. The AUTEC facility, sometimes referred to as the “Area 51 of the ocean,” has been speculated to be involved in testing advanced technology. The discussion surrounding UFOs has increased significantly in recent years, leading to more public and governmental scrutiny.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further congressional hearings are planned to investigate these claims. As discussions continue, lawmakers aim to uncover more information regarding UAPs and their implications for national security.</p>
