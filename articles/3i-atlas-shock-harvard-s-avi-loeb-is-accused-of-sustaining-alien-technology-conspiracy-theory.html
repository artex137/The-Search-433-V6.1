      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shock: Harvard's Avi Loeb Is Accused Of Sustaining 'Alien Technology' Conspiracy Theory</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has ignited a heated debate online, with Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb facing accusations of perpetuating conspiracy theories about alien technology. The discourse has spanned several months and primarily unfolded on social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), since the comet's discovery in July 2023.</p>

<p>This controversy highlights the broader implications of how scientific phenomena can fuel speculation and conspiracy theories. Researchers, including Mert Bayar of the University of Washington's Centre for an Informed Public, have begun to analyze the phenomenon, focusing on why the public is drawn to such narratives. Bayar's recent study, titled "Alien of the Gaps: How 3I/ATLAS Was Turned into a Spaceship Online," examines the dynamics of information dissemination surrounding 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Approximately 700,000 posts about the comet have been analyzed on X from July 1 to November 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>About 280,000 of those posts (40%) mention aliens or extraterrestrial technology.</li>
    <li>Loeb has been referenced in roughly 130,000 posts regarding 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Over 82,000 posts explicitly link Loeb's name to the alien-technology hypothesis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2023: 3I/ATLAS is first identified as a non-solar interstellar comet, generating immediate interest.</p>
<p>July 1 - November 21, 2023: Mert Bayar conducts an analysis of social media posts about 3I/ATLAS, revealing significant speculation about alien involvement.</p>
<p>November 2023: Bayar publishes his findings, highlighting the influence of Avi Loeb on public discourse surrounding the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Where natural explanations feel incomplete, we substitute a different higher agency, not Zeus this time, but extraterrestrials," said Mert Bayar regarding the public's tendency to turn to alien theories.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>"To be fair, at times, Avi Loeb states that 3I/ATLAS is most likely a natural interstellar comet," Bayar acknowledged.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This situation reflects a growing trend in which scientific discoveries are rapidly interpreted through the lens of conspiracy theories. In previous instances, such as the discovery of the interstellar object 'Oumuamua, Loeb has also suggested the possibility of alien technology, which has contributed to ongoing public fascination.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of the "mystery economy," as described by Bayar, suggests that the creation of mystery and speculation is often more profitable than factual reporting, leading to the amplification of these narratives.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the spread of conspiracy theories related to 3I/ATLAS may continue, as researchers aim to understand the implications of such narratives on public perception and scientific discourse.</p>
