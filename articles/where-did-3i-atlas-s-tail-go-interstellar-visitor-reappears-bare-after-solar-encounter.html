      <h2>Where Did 3I/ATLAS's Tail Go? Interstellar Visitor Reappears Bare After Solar Encounter</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which reappeared without a visible tail in images taken at the R. Naves Observatory in Spain on November 5, 2025. This unexpected appearance has prompted questions about the object's nature and behaviour after its close pass by the Sun in late October 2025.</p>

<p>The absence of a tail challenges existing theories about comet behaviour and raises concerns about the composition of 3I/ATLAS. Researchers are currently analysing the data to understand the object's changes and implications for interstellar objects. Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory are monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026 for further insights.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Last observed: November 5, 2025, at R. Naves Observatory, Spain</li>
    <li>Close solar pass: Late October 2025</li>
    <li>Size reduction: Approximately 13% since solar pass</li>
    <li>Next major milestone: Near Jupiter in March 2026</li>
    <li>Monitoring agency: NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS passed close to the Sun in late October 2025, typically a period when comets emit dust and gas to form a tail. However, images captured on November 5, 2025, showed the object as a compact, tailless nucleus, baffling astronomers. Further analysis indicates that the object may have shrunk by about 13%, leading to speculation about its composition and whether it is indeed a comet.</p>

<p>Despite increased solar activity, 3I/ATLAS exhibited no signs of dust or gas emissions, which are typically expected during such encounters. Researchers noted that the object remained unaffected by recent solar storms that would usually enhance tail formation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We expected an active coma after perihelion, but it's gone quiet — completely inert,” said one astronomer commenting on the unexpected behaviour of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This phenomenon contrasts with previous interstellar objects, such as ʻOumuamua, which displayed no tail or jets, and 2I/Borisov, which behaved like a classic comet. 3I/ATLAS's behaviour raises questions about the categorisation of interstellar objects, blurring the lines between comets and asteroids.</p>

<p>Astrophysicists suggest that the lack of a tail might indicate that 3I/ATLAS has lost its outer volatile layers or that its jets have ceased due to changes in rotation or composition. This could signify a new class of interstellar debris that is solid and highly resistant to solar heat.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations will be crucial as scientists continue to study 3I/ATLAS. The data collected during its approach to Jupiter in March 2026 will help clarify whether the object is a comet stripped of its outer layers or something entirely different.</p>
