      <h2>'Multiple UFOs' spotted flying over Persian Gulf in wild US military footage</h2>

<p>Military drone footage has captured what UFO researchers describe as a formation of mysterious orbs flying over the Persian Gulf. The one-minute clip, recorded by an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US Air Force shortly after 6 p.m. local time, shows three objects traversing the area. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This footage, unveiled by investigative journalist Jeremy Corbell on the WEAPONIZED Podcast, has drawn attention to ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in a region known for its military activity. Authorities have classified the objects as UAP, indicating a formal recognition of their unexplained nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Recording time: Shortly after 6 p.m. local time</li>
    <li>Location: Persian Gulf, between Saudi Arabia and Iran</li>
    <li>Drone model: MQ-9 Reaper operated by the US Air Force</li>
    <li>Number of objects: Three orbs</li>
    <li>Designation: Classified as UAP by the US Department of War</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The footage was recorded by a US Air Force drone, which utilized infrared sensors to capture the orbs in flight. The video shows the orbs moving in a formation, with one object appearing to fall behind before accelerating to the front. Corbell and his co-host George Knapp have analyzed the footage in detail, emphasizing its military origin and the advanced technology used to capture it.</p>

<p>In prior incidents, military personnel have reported numerous encounters with luminous objects in the same region. One notable account described an object that flooded a Navy ship's bridge with intense light, causing a commanding officer to shield her eyes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Your government has labeled this UAP and you were never supposed to see this footage,” said Jeremy Corbell on the WEAPONIZED Podcast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is a military recorded sensor generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO,” said George Knapp. “And clearly, you watch this, and that's not what it is.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recording location has become a hotspot for UAP activity, with several military encounters reported in recent years. The US government has officially stated that no physical evidence has been recovered to prove the existence of UFOs or extraterrestrial beings. However, the Pentagon's ARRO department has released minimal videos showing clear UFO sightings, despite ongoing leaks of whistleblower footage.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the recorded footage and other UAP incidents are ongoing. The US government continues to face pressure to release more information about UFO sightings and encounters. Further disclosures may follow as authorities review the existing evidence and respond to public interest. </p>
