      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-15 16:46 UTC</p>

      <h2>NASA Issues 3I/ATLAS Update: 'Unambiguously a Comet' and Poses 'No Impact Risk'</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has successfully flown past the Sun and remains intact as of 15 November 2025. The comet is currently displaying a spectacular tail and has emitted its first detected radio signals, while also assisting a spacecraft at Mars in rehearsing for planetary defence.</p>

<p>This update is significant as it addresses ongoing speculation about the comet's nature and origin, particularly theories suggesting it could be an alien probe. NASA's findings clarify that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet and poses no risk of impacting Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> 29–30 October 2025, at approximately 1.36–1.4 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> Expected on 19 December 2025, at about 1.8 AU (approximately 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Current Location:</strong> Constellation Virgo, magnitude near 9.8</li>
    <li><strong>First Detected Radio Signals:</strong> Emitted by the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa</li>
    <li><strong>Public Viewing:</strong> Best seen in pre-dawn hours with an 8-inch (20 cm) telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) in Chile. It reached its closest point to the Sun between 29 and 30 October 2025. On 15 November 2025, NASA issued an update confirming the comet's nature and its safe trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa states that 3I/ATLAS is 'unambiguously a comet', with an icy nucleus surrounded by an active coma of gas and dust.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nasa emphasizes that there is 'no impact risk' and there is 'no scenario' where it hits Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ongoing debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS has been fueled by its unusual characteristics and the survival of its close encounter with the Sun. Previous interstellar objects have sparked similar discussions, but NASA's latest findings reinforce the scientific understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to release high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which will enhance our understanding of the comet. Ground-based telescopes will continue tracking 3I/ATLAS into the spring of 2026, providing further opportunities for scientific study.</p>
