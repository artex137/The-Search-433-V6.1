      <h2>'From another world': 3I/ATLAS photobombs a galaxy and shows off its multiple tails in stunning new image</h2>

<p>A stunning new image has captured the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS passing a distant galaxy, NGC 4691, on November 16. The photograph, taken by New Mexico-based astrophotographer Satoru Murata, showcases the comet's multiple tails, including its long ion tail and a shorter anti-tail. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This image is significant because it highlights the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, which is believed to be about 7 billion years old and originates from the Milky Way. Murata's photograph serves as a reminder of the comet's natural interstellar origins. Astronomers are also looking forward to new high-definition images of 3I/ATLAS from NASA, expected to be released on November 19, after a delay due to the recent government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
<li>Date of photo: November 16</li>
<li>Location of galaxy: NGC 4691, approximately 70 million light-years from Earth</li>
<li>Comet's speed: Over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h)</li>
<li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, at a distance of 168 million miles (270 million km)</li>
<li>Photographer: Satoru Murata</li>
<li>Upcoming NASA photo release: November 19</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in early July, traveling through the solar system. The comet reached its closest point to the sun on October 29 and recently reemerged from behind the sun relative to Earth. On November 16, Satoru Murata captured the image of the comet alongside NGC 4691.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the comet has exhibited unusual characteristics, including unexpected brightening and a temporary color change. Observers noted the comet's tails appeared to vanish due to an optical illusion related to its position.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>No, it's not an alien mothership, and the probability that it's any type of object created by extraterrestrial civilization is close to zero,</blockquote>
<blockquote>Satoru Murata, astrophotographer</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following 'Oumuamua in 2017. While some researchers have proposed that 3I/ATLAS may be an alien spacecraft, the majority of the astronomical community maintains it is a comet. Similar claims were made about 'Oumuamua, which is now widely considered an asteroid.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers await the release of high-definition images from NASA, which will provide further insights into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. The comet will reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</p>
