      <h2>CIA Boss' 1947 Diary Sparks UFO Bombshell as 'Certain Papers' Sent to White House Emerge</h2>

<p>A diary from 1947, kept by Rear Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the first Director of Central Intelligence, has raised new questions about early UFO investigations. The diary indicates that highly sensitive materials were delivered to the White House on 24 September 1947, after Hillenkoetter received a directive the day before to prepare documents for this purpose.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that a compartmented program related to UFOs was under review by the White House shortly after the Roswell incident. Authorities are now examining the implications of these entries and their potential connection to MJ-12, a group alleged to oversee UFO investigations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Diary entries date to September 1947.</li>
  <li>Hillenkoetter recorded a directive from the Office of the Secretary of Defense on 23 September.</li>
  <li>Documents were to be delivered to the White House by 9:00 a.m. on 24 September.</li>
  <li>Twelve copies of the papers were prepared, plus one for Rear Admiral Souers.</li>
  <li>Hillenkoetter coordinated with Secretary of Defense James Forrestal after his White House visit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 23 September 1947, Hillenkoetter received instructions to prepare documents for the White House. He noted in his diary that the papers were to be delivered by 9:00 a.m. the following day. On 24 September, he recorded a visit to the White House to discuss these 'certain papers,' indicating the importance of the materials.</p>

<p>Further entries show that Hillenkoetter oversaw the preparation of twelve copies of the documents, which aligns with later references to MJ-12. He also delayed internal CIA meetings to ensure proper coordination with senior defense officials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The precise instructions, timing, and terminology reveal a sophisticated administrative footprint that mirrors other historically sensitive projects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this diary's revelation, MJ-12 had been dismissed by skeptics as a myth or fabrication. However, Hillenkoetter's contemporaneous documentation provides a credible source that challenges these claims. The controlled handling of sensitive materials suggests a structured initiative in the early stages of classified UFO programs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating the implications of Hillenkoetter's diary and its connection to early UFO programs. Further analysis of related archival documents may shed more light on the origins of what could be the MJ-12 initiative.</p>
