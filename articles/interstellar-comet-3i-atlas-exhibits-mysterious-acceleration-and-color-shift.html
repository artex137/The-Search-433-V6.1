      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits mysterious acceleration and color shift</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar object, Comet 3I/ATLAS, has shown unusual behavior as it travels through our solar system, according to data from NASA. The comet has experienced acceleration that cannot be solely attributed to gravitational forces and has shifted to a blue hue as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has sparked significant interest among astronomers and scientists. Authorities are monitoring the comet closely, with the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA using spacecraft to gather data while ground-based telescopes are temporarily unable to observe the object. The scientific community is preparing for the comet's reappearance in early December, when it will pass near Earth, allowing for further analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>Current acceleration cannot be explained by gravity alone.</li>
    <li>The comet has shifted to a blue hue as it approaches the Sun.</li>
    <li>It is currently positioned directly behind the Sun, making it unobservable from Earth.</li>
    <li>Ground-based telescopes will resume tracking the comet in early December.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass near Earth in mid-December.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has recently exhibited unusual behavior, including unexplained acceleration and a color shift. This has been documented by NASA, which has reported that the comet's motion may be due to gas escaping its surface.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has suggested that the blue color could be linked to ionized carbon monoxide, but he has also raised the possibility of an artificial source. Meanwhile, NASA's acting administrator has dismissed any extraterrestrial theories regarding the comet's origin.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches the Sun, it has become unobservable from Earth. This situation is expected to change in early December when astronomers can once again track its movement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "the non-gravitational acceleration might be the technological signature of an internal engine," highlighting the ongoing debates around the comet's behavior.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nasa's acting administrator has affirmed that the comet poses no threat, emphasizing that it is a natural object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a small group of known interstellar comets, with its behavior raising questions about the characteristics of such objects. The scientific community has previously observed unusual phenomena in comets, but the current acceleration and color change have not been documented in other known comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the observational blackout is expected to end in early December, astronomers will prepare for the comet's approach. They aim to determine if the comet has lost mass during its solar passage and to further investigate its unusual properties.</p>
