      <h2>Planetary Defence Shift: 3I/ATLAS Forces Nations to Prepare for Multiple Threats</h2>

<p>Global powers have ramped up planetary defence preparations in response to the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has drawn attention due to its unpredictable behaviour. Over the past month, various countries have conducted extensive simulations and exercises aimed at testing their ability to manage potential threats from this object. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>Authorities are taking 3I/ATLAS seriously, with multiple nations coordinating their efforts to enhance readiness for potential high-velocity extrasolar threats. The European Space Agency (ESA) has activated its full planetary-defence triad, initiating a series of unprecedented global drills that include simulations of complex, multi-body events. This marks a significant shift in how nations approach planetary defence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has exhibited unpredictable behaviour, including non-gravitational acceleration.</li>
    <li>The ESA's £18.4 billion ($23.1 billion) expansion was approved rapidly.</li>
    <li>The U.S. Space Force advanced a high-altitude orbital-tracking drill originally set for late 2026 to this autumn.</li>
    <li>Countries including Japan, Australia, South Korea, and Brazil participated in joint planetary defence exercises.</li>
    <li>The International Asteroid Warning Network has integrated classified sensor data for analysis of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, a series of coordinated planetary-defence exercises have taken place globally. The ESA initiated the drills by activating its planetary-defence triad, conducting simulations over three days. Japan followed with an asteroid-impact coordination drill, integrating various satellite operators. Within 48 hours, the U.S. Space Force conducted its high-altitude tracking rehearsal, advancing the timeline of its original schedule. Other nations joined these exercises, focusing on the potential risks posed by 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is the scenario nations have quietly planned for but hoped never to face,” said an ESA spokesperson. “Its unpredictable nature has forced us to accelerate our readiness.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, planetary defence has been a theoretical exercise, focused on possible future threats. The arrival of 3I/ATLAS, however, has prompted a significant shift in strategy. The object’s unusual characteristics have led to increased urgency in developing global defence capabilities, highlighting the need for more advanced tracking systems and sensors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, nations will continue to enhance their planetary defence systems and conduct further simulations. The upcoming weeks will focus on refining tracking capabilities and preparing for any potential scenarios that may arise from this interstellar visitor.</p>
