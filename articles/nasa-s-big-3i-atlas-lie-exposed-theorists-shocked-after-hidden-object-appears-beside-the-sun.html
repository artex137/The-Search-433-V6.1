      <h2>NASA Faces Criticism Over 3I/ATLAS Object Claims</h2>

<p>NASA is under scrutiny following allegations that it has misled the public about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. The accusations surfaced on social media after users claimed the agency fabricated information regarding the object's visibility, particularly as a 'second, hidden' object reportedly travels alongside it. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The controversy has gained traction, with tens of thousands of shares on social media platforms. Critics assert that NASA's narrative about 3I/ATLAS is an elaborate cover-up. They argue that the agency's projected solar conjunction on October 29, which was meant to render the object invisible, was a ploy to divert attention from the reality of its continued visibility.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA is accused of lying about the visibility of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Social media posts claim a 'hidden' object is trailing 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Critics allege that NASA's conjunction narrative was misleading.</li>
    <li>The solar conjunction was projected for October 29.</li>
    <li>Amateur astronomers report that 3I/ATLAS remains visible near the star Spica and the planet Venus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's narrative surrounding 3I/ATLAS indicated that the object would become invisible during a solar conjunction on October 29. Following this announcement, amateur astronomers reported sightings of the object near Spica and Venus, contradicting NASA's claims. In the days following the conjunction, new images surfaced, allegedly showing a second object trailing 3I/ATLAS, which has fueled further allegations of a cover-up.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nobody has officially confirmed the existence of a second object. However, sky-watchers have expressed their disbelief in the agency's narrative, stating, 'They do not want you to see its true behaviour.'</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is not the first time NASA has faced scrutiny over its communications. Previous controversies have involved claims of misinformation regarding celestial events. The current situation has intensified skepticism among amateur astronomers and the public regarding official scientific narratives.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has not yet issued a formal response to the accusations. The community of sky-watchers continues to monitor the skies for evidence that may support or refute the claims surrounding 3I/ATLAS.</p>
