      <h2>Major scientific breakthrough as black hole producing 'UFO' captured for first time</h2>

<p>A black hole located in the galaxy NGC 3783 has been observed producing ultrafast outflows, marking a first in scientific research. The discovery was made with the help of the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton and JAXA's XRISM X-ray telescopes, which monitored the black hole about 130 million light-years from Earth. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it offers new insights into the behavior of black holes and their influence on galaxy evolution. Researchers have observed how a rapid burst of X-ray light from the black hole triggers the formation of ultra-fast winds, providing a deeper understanding of the dynamics involved in these celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: NGC 3783, a bright barred spiral galaxy, approximately 130 million light-years from Earth.</li>
    <li>Black hole mass: About 28 million times that of the Sun.</li>
    <li>Observation period: July 2024, over a span of 10 days.</li>
    <li>Wind speed: Reached approximately 57,000 kilometres (35,400 miles) per second, or one-fifth the speed of light.</li>
    <li>Research published in: Astronomy & Astrophysics.</li>
    <li>Lead author: Liyi Gu, astronomer at the Space Research Organisation Netherlands (SRON).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2024, astronomers observed a bright X-ray flare from the black hole in NGC 3783. The flare lasted for 12 hours before fading, during which ultrafast winds were detected. These winds formed rapidly, within a single day, following the initial burst of X-ray light.</p>

<p>The telescopes tracked the black hole's activity, revealing that the winds were generated by the untwisting of the active galactic nucleus's magnetic field. This phenomenon is similar to solar flares but occurs on a much larger scale.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "For the first time, we've seen how a rapid burst of X-ray light from a black hole immediately triggers ultra-fast winds, with these winds forming in just a single day," said Liyi Gu, lead author of the study.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "By zeroing in on an active supermassive black hole, the two telescopes have found something we've not seen before: rapid, ultra-fast, flare-triggered winds reminiscent of those that form at the Sun," stated Erik Kuulkers, ESA astronomer.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery builds on previous studies of black holes and their associated phenomena. Active galactic nuclei are known for their brightness, which surpasses what can be explained by the stars alone. Understanding the dynamics of these regions can shed light on how galaxies evolve over time.</p>

<p>The findings suggest that the processes governing solar and high-energy physics may share similarities across the universe, providing a broader context for astrophysical research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further investigations into the implications of this discovery for our understanding of black holes and their role in galaxy formation. No specific timelines for future studies have been disclosed.</p>
