      <h2>NASA responds to claims that mystery space object is potential alien spacecraft</h2>

<p>NASA has addressed claims regarding the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, which was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. The object has generated excitement in the scientific community as only the third interstellar object confirmed to visit our solar system, but it has also sparked speculation about its potential as an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it may provide insights into the universe's origins. Researchers believe the object could be older than any known bodies in our solar system. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, with its closest approach to Earth expected in late October 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First spotted: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size: 3.5 miles</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to Earth: Late October 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: Nearly twice as fast as previous interstellar visitors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Since then, it has been a topic of interest among researchers and the general public alike, particularly due to its unusual speed and size.</p>
<p>In the following months, speculation about the object's nature intensified, with some claiming it might be an alien probe. However, NASA has maintained that it behaves like a comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Dr. Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies:</strong> “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know.” 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Dr. Avi Loeb, theoretical physicist:</strong> “If future data will indicate the absence of a cometary tail, we will be faced with the tantalizing possibility that it did not inherit a random velocity in interstellar space but instead was sent towards the inner solar system by design.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov, which have also intrigued scientists and the public. The scientific community generally supports the view that interstellar objects are natural celestial bodies rather than artificial constructs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The object is expected to pass within approximately 170 million miles of Earth, with close encounters with Mars, Jupiter, and Venus in the coming months.</p>
