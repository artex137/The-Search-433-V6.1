      <h2>False robot alien spider story is invading social media</h2>

<p>A Facebook post claiming scientists have discovered robotic micro spiders from the comet 3I/ATLAS in Antarctica has circulated widely since October 2025. The post alleges that these spiders detached from the comet during its closest approach to Earth and are gathering data from the ice to transmit back to space. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this claim.</p>

<p>This situation highlights the spread of misinformation on social media. Authorities and fact-checking organizations, such as Snopes, have investigated the claim and found no evidence to support it. They have rated the story as false, emphasizing the need for critical evaluation of information shared online.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Claim:</strong> Robotic micro spiders from comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in Antarctica</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach of 3I/ATLAS:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Fact-checking agency:</strong> Snopes</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> No evidence found to support the claim</li>
    <li><strong>Image analysis:</strong> Image likely AI-generated</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, a Facebook post began circulating, claiming that robotic spiders from the comet 3I/ATLAS had been found in Antarctica. The post suggested that these spiders were gathering and transmitting data. Following the post, users began to question its validity, leading to inquiries sent to Snopes.</p>
<p>Snopes conducted a search for information related to the claim using various search engines. They found no credible sources or evidence supporting the existence of robotic spiders or any related discoveries from the comet.</p>
<p>As of now, the closest approach of comet 3I/ATLAS to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, which contradicts the claim that the spiders have already detached.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no evidence to support any of the details in the story shared in the posts. Therefore, we're rating this claim as false,” Snopes stated in their investigation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader trend of misinformation related to extraterrestrial life and space exploration. The page that originally posted the story, Space Lane, has a history of sharing fabricated stories about alien encounters and discoveries. Snopes has previously fact-checked another claim regarding 3I/ATLAS being an alien ship heading for Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Fact-checking organizations will likely continue to monitor and address similar claims as they arise, emphasizing the importance of verifying information before sharing it on social media platforms.</p>
