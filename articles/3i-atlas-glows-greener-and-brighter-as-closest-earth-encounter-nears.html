      <h2>3I/ATLAS Glows Greener And Brighter as Closest Earth Encounter Nears</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has begun to emit a vivid green glow as it approaches Earth, with its closest encounter expected on December 19, 2023. Discovered in late June, the comet is travelling at approximately 210,000 kilometres per hour (130,000 mph) and is not gravitationally bound to the sun, indicating it will not return after this pass.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers studying cosmic phenomena. 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Its unique composition and behaviour provide valuable insights into the building blocks of other star systems, as scientists continue to monitor its brightness and colour changes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in late June 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2023, at a distance of 270 million kilometres (170 million miles).</li>
    <li>Current speed of the comet is approximately 210,000 kilometres per hour (130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>New imagery from the Gemini North telescope taken on November 26, 2023, shows a bright green coma.</li>
    <li>The comet is believed to be the largest and oldest interstellar object observed, potentially up to seven billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in late June 2023 and has been observed as it travels through the solar system. Initial observations indicated a red hue, which changed to green as it neared the sun. The latest findings from the Gemini North telescope were reported on November 26, 2023, confirming the comet’s brightening and colour shift.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023. Astronomers remain vigilant, anticipating potential outbursts due to delayed heating from solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Studying 3I/ATLAS offers a crucial opportunity to analyse primordial material from a different star system,” said an astronomer involved in tracking the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to be detected in our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique characteristics provide a rare glimpse into the chemical composition of other star systems, enhancing our understanding of cosmic evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, scientists will continue to observe its behaviour for any potential outbursts or changes in brightness. This opportunity may yield unprecedented data about interstellar materials before the comet exits the solar system.</p>
