      <h2>Pentagon Disinformation Fueled America’s UFO Mythology, WSJ Reports</h2>

<p>A recent investigation by the Wall Street Journal has revealed that much of America’s UFO mythology has been driven by disinformation campaigns from the Pentagon, aimed at covering up real secret-weapons programs rather than extraterrestrial encounters. The report details efforts dating back to the 1950s, where the U.S. military disseminated doctored photos and false narratives, including images of “flying saucers” at Area 51, to mislead the public and shield classified stealth fighter projects.</p>

<p>This investigation matters as it highlights the lengths to which the military has gone to protect national security interests during the Cold War. The Pentagon’s chief scientist Sean Kirkpatrick has led a congressionally-ordered probe that found local commanders often propagated disinformation, creating a landscape ripe for myths surrounding UFOs. Such myths served to misdirect foreign intelligence, particularly from the Soviet Union.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The investigation reveals Pentagon disinformation efforts began in the 1950s.</li>
    <li>Doctored images and false stories were used to mislead the public.</li>
    <li>In 2023, a “hazing” ritual in classified Air Force programs involved showing fake photos of supposed antigravity vehicles.</li>
    <li>The Department of Defense plans to release a follow-up report later this year.</li>
    <li>A public report on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) in 2024 omitted key facts to protect classified programs.</li>
    <li>Republican members of Congress have formed a caucus demanding transparency on UAP crash retrieval programs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the 1950s, the U.S. military began spreading disinformation about UFOs to cover up secret weapons programs. This included doctored photos and false narratives about alien technology. By 2023, investigators reported a bizarre “hazing” ritual in which new commanders were shown fake images of antigravity vehicles.</p>

<p>In 1967, incidents occurred where nuclear missile launch systems were mysteriously disabled, leading some former Air Force personnel to believe that these events were caused by alien craft. The Pentagon's ongoing investigations have revealed a pattern of misinformation that has persisted for decades.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a gigantic cover-up,” said Robert Salas, a former Air Force captain interviewed by WSJ, who believes the military has concealed vital truths from the public and even its own personnel.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The investigation sheds light on a history of military disinformation that has contributed to the public's fascination with UFOs. The tactics used were not only aimed at protecting classified technology but also served to mislead foreign adversaries during a tense period of the Cold War.</p>

<p>With the recent formation of a congressional caucus, there is growing pressure on the Pentagon to disclose more information regarding UAP and related programs, as public skepticism continues to rise.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Department of Defense plans to release a follow-up report detailing its findings later this year, while congressional members are pushing for greater transparency regarding UAP investigations and crash retrieval programs.</p>
