      <h2>Belgian UFO sighting memorial removed at family’s request</h2>

<p>Aalter's municipal authorities have removed a memorial dedicated to an alleged UFO sighting in eastern Flanders at the request of the family of Marin Vandercruyssen, who claimed to have witnessed five unidentified flying objects in 1955. The memorial was taken down quietly at the end of last week, shortly after its restoration to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the sighting.</p>

<p>The removal of the monument has drawn attention as it was the only one of its kind in western Europe. Frederick Delaere, manager of the Belgian reporting helpline UFO-meldpunt, stated that the loss represents a significant piece of Belgian folklore. Local authorities restored the monument earlier this year, marking an event that has captured public imagination for decades.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Aalter, eastern Flanders, Belgium</li>
    <li>Event date: July 21, 1955</li>
    <li>Memorial restoration: 2025, for the 70th anniversary</li>
    <li>Family request: Memorial removed at the family's request, not disclosed when</li>
    <li>Vandercruyssen's age at sighting: 18</li>
    <li>UFO sighting description: Five circular flying saucers, at least 100m in diameter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 1955, Marin Vandercruyssen, then 18, claimed to have seen five UFOs while on leave from the military. He reported the sighting while riding on his father's motorbike in Lotenhulle. Vandercruyssen described the objects as gigantic, hovering for ten minutes before disappearing.</p>

<p>In 2004, Vandercruyssen successfully convinced local authorities to erect a memorial depicting the UFO formation. The stone monument was unveiled and became a symbol of the sighting.</p>

<p>In late September 2025, Vandercruyssen's family, through legal representation, requested the removal of the memorial, leading to its quiet dismantling by Aalter's municipal authorities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re losing a piece of Belgian folklore,” said Frederick Delaere, manager of the Belgian reporting helpline, UFO-meldpunt.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s his life’s work that’s been taken away,” remarked Kamiel De Bruyne, author of Bizarre Belgium.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The sighting by Vandercruyssen has remained a topic of interest in Belgian culture, marked by the establishment of the memorial in 2004. Local councillor Dirk de Smul noted that the event is remembered as a “collective memory” that many kept quiet about due to uncertainty about public opinion. Vandercruyssen maintained hope that extraterrestrial visitors would one day return to the site.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The fate of the memorial stone is currently unknown. Aalter council and the Vandercruyssen family have declined to comment further on the matter.</p>
