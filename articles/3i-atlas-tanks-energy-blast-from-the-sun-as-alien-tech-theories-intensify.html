      <h2>3I/ATLAS tanks energy blast from the Sun as alien tech theories intensify</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has withstood a direct blast from a solar eruption that occurred in late September. The Sun unleashed a violent coronal mass ejection (CME), sending a surge of plasma and magnetic fields toward the comet as it travels through the solar system at approximately 220,000 kilometres per hour. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as it marks the first time an interstellar object has survived such a solar strike. Scientists are currently monitoring 3I/ATLAS to assess whether the blast will alter its trajectory or shed material that could provide insights into its composition. The comet has generated considerable intrigue, with some researchers speculating about its potential origins and purpose.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Solar coronal mass ejection (CME) impact on 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of CME: Late September 2023</li>
    <li>Speed of 3I/ATLAS: Approximately 220,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Mass estimate by Avi Loeb: Exceeds 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Previous similar event: Comet Encke observed by NASA’s STEREO A in 2007</li>
    <li>NASA's position: 3I/ATLAS is a comet, not alien technology</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late September 2023, the Sun emitted a coronal mass ejection (CME) that directly impacted 3I/ATLAS. The CME consisted of a large release of plasma and magnetic fields. Following this event, scientists began to monitor the comet to determine the effects of the solar strike.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has raised questions about 3I/ATLAS's size and origin, estimating its mass to be far greater than previously thought. His analysis has sparked renewed speculation about the object, leading to a range of theories regarding its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Is 3I/ATLAS an unusually massive comet with an unusual chemical composition on an unusually rare trajectory or alien technology?” Avi Loeb wrote in a blog post. “In both cases, the object could shed CO2 and H2O ices from material that collected on its frozen surface as it plowed through interplanetary and interstellar space.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA has insisted that 3I/ATLAS is not alien technology, stating, “3I/ATLAS is just a comet and not a mothership on its way to invade Earth.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This encounter follows previous observations of comets enduring solar blasts. In 2007, NASA’s STEREO A spacecraft documented comet Encke losing and regrowing its tail after a CME impact. The ongoing discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS has been fueled by recent findings from NASA regarding possible evidence of ancient alien life on Mars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves past Mars in the coming months. Observations will focus on any changes in its trajectory or material ejected as a result of the solar impact.</p>
