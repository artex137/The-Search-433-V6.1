      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS displays luminous beats every 16.16 hours and sparks debate about alien technology</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile, has exhibited a unique brightness pattern every 16.16 hours, prompting discussions about its origins and the possibility of alien technology. The comet travels at a speed of 61 km/s through the Solar System and has been confirmed to have a hyperbolic orbit, indicating it originated from outside the Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery has drawn attention from both scientists and the public. Astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Universidade has raised questions about the comet's brightness pattern, arguing that it may indicate controlled ejections rather than typical natural phenomena. NASA continues to classify 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet based on spectral analyses, stating that less than 10% of the light comes from the nucleus of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
  <li>Travels at 61 km/s through the Solar System.</li>
  <li>Brightness cycles every 16.16 hours, observed since July 2025.</li>
  <li>NASA classifies it as a natural comet based on spectral analysis.</li>
  <li>Passed 29 million km from Mars on October 2025.</li>
  <li>Will come within 170 million km of Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
  <li>Approaching Jupiter in March 2026, 53 million km away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS system in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Observations of its brightness began shortly thereafter, with significant data collected by ground-based telescopes throughout the following months.</p>
<p>On October 28, 2025, the comet passed 29 million km from Mars, and on November 30, 2025, NASA conducted spectral analysis in Maryland, confirming the object's classification as a natural comet.</p>
<p>Recent images captured on November 16 and 17, 2025, in New Mexico have shown varying jet directions from the comet, contributing to the ongoing debate about its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The rhythmic precision of the brightness pattern is atypical for natural comets, suggesting a possible controlled ejection mechanism.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA has maintained that “the object exhibits typical characteristics of a natural comet despite its interstellar origin.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies of interstellar objects have often focused on their physical characteristics and origins. 3I/ATLAS's brightness pattern has sparked renewed interest in the potential for technological influences in celestial phenomena.</p>
<p>Researchers have noted that the comet's non-gravitational acceleration challenges existing models of comet behavior, prompting further investigation into its unique properties.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on December 19, 2025, scientists plan to conduct detailed spectroscopy and monitor its brightness patterns closely. Ongoing studies will aim to differentiate between natural and technological explanations for the comet's behavior.</p>
