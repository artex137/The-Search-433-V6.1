      <h2>NASA Speaks On 3I/ATLAS: Why The Oldest Interstellar Comet Is Scientifically Key</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, the oldest interstellar comet, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. The agency held a conference on November 19, 2025, to clarify the comet's nature after a period of speculation and silence due to a government shutdown.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as it addresses ongoing conspiracy theories regarding the comet's origins. NASA officials have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a natural object, not an extraterrestrial spacecraft, and emphasize the scientific importance of studying this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 267 million km</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Speed:</strong> 246,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Government Shutdown:</strong> October 1 to November 12, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, during a survey in Chile. It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, while the U.S. government was shut down. NASA was unable to release new images during this critical period, which fueled speculation about the comet's nature. On November 19, 2025, NASA held a conference to present the new images and to clarify the comet's identity, confirming it as a natural object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet... and all evidence points to it being a comet,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya during the conference. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The likelihood is it came from a solar system older than our own solar system,” noted Tom Statler, lead scientist for solar system small bodies at NASA’s Planetary Science Division.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet ever recorded, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its discovery has drawn significant public interest, largely due to speculation about its origins. The period of silence from NASA coincided with a critical phase in the comet's journey, leading to increased conspiracy theories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the images captured from various instruments, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the MAVEN spacecraft, to gather more data on the comet's composition and behavior as it approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>
