      <h2>Harvard Scientist Warns of Potential Threat from Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has warned that the comet-like object 3I/ATLAS, currently moving through our solar system, could trigger a rare and unpredictable 'Black Swan' event that might change civilization forever. This warning comes as 3I/ATLAS approaches several planets, including Mars and Venus, while temporarily hiding from view as it passes behind the Sun.</p>

<p>This matter is significant because it raises concerns about the potential implications of 3I/ATLAS. While many scientists have dismissed the notion of an alien invasion associated with the object, Loeb argues that the scientific community is underestimating its potential risks. He urges NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) to redirect funding towards studying 3I/ATLAS instead of focusing solely on Earth-based projects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is a mystery object moving through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a prominent physicist advocating for increased attention to 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to pass closely by Mars and Venus.</li>
    <li>Loeb describes 3I/ATLAS as "statistically suspicious."</li>
    <li>Loeb appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast to discuss his concerns.</li>
    <li>Loeb calls for a fraction of NASA's budget to be allocated to study 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as it entered our solar system. Since then, it has been monitored by various space agencies, including NASA. As it approaches Mars and Venus, it will momentarily hide from view by passing behind the Sun. The exact timing of its reemergence is not disclosed.</p>

<p>In a recent podcast episode, Avi Loeb expressed his views on the object, emphasizing its unusual characteristics and the need for further investigation. He argues that ignoring such anomalies could lead to missing significant discoveries.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If you keep ignoring outliers, you miss the very things that redefine reality,” Loeb stated during the podcast. “The cost of being right and doing nothing could be missing the most important discovery in human history.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The concept of a 'Black Swan' event, popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, refers to unpredictable occurrences with significant consequences that are often dismissed before they happen. Such events have previously been linked to financial crises and global pandemics.</p>

<p>Loeb's warning highlights a broader debate within the scientific community regarding the prioritization of funding for Earth-based research versus the exploration of potential extraterrestrial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb has called for NASA and the ESA to reconsider their funding priorities to include studies of 3I/ATLAS. The timeline for any potential investigations or changes in funding is not disclosed.</p>
