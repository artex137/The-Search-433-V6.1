      <h2>'It's coming right for us!': Witness tells Congress of UFO sighting</h2>

<p>Witnesses have testified before the U.S. Congress about their experiences with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during a hearing on "Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena" held on October 10, 2023. Five witnesses, including military veterans, shared their accounts of UFO sightings, but there have been no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it marks a continued effort by U.S. authorities to investigate and understand these phenomena. The testimonies could influence future policies regarding national security and aerial phenomena, as well as public perception of UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

This object joined three other similar objects before speeding away and disappearing.</p>
