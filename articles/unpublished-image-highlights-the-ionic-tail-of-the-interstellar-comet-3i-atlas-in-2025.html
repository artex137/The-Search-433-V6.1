      <h2>Unpublished image highlights the ionic tail of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in 2025</h2>

<p>The Virtual Telescope Project has captured an image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in the early hours of November 11, 2025, in Manciano, Italy. The image shows an elongated ion tail extending visibly into space, indicating active behavior following its perihelion on October 30.</p>

<p>This observation is significant for astronomers studying the evolution of interstellar objects. The focus is on analyzing the gaseous composition of the comet to better understand its interstellar origins. The ion tail is notable for measuring about 0.7 degrees in angular length, with an anti-tail pointing to the southeast.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: November 11, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li>Telescope used: ARTEC-250 robotic telescope</li>
    <li>Magnitude of the comet: 9.8</li>
    <li>Perihelion distance from the Sun: 1.4 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Estimated mass of the comet: 33 billion tonnes</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system, which is funded by NASA during routine asteroid searches. Initial observations raised questions about its classification as an asteroid or a comet. By July 2, astronomers confirmed the presence of a marginal coma and an elongation of 3 arc seconds. The comet's perihelion occurred on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</p>

<p>Following its perihelion, the comet has shown notable features in its ion tail. Images captured on November 10 revealed complexity with asymmetric jets. The Virtual Telescope Project's recent capture on November 11 displayed a tail extending into space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The ionic tail forms due to the interaction of ions with the solar magnetic field,” said an astronomer involved in the project. “This observation allows us to monitor the comet's evolution and its unique chemical signatures.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed within the Solar System, following a hyperbolic trajectory that confirms its external origin. Prior observations of interstellar comets have provided valuable insights into the composition and behavior of such objects.</p>

<p>Recent encounters with space missions have also provided data on variations in the solar wind and magnetic draping, enhancing the understanding of the comet's interactions with its environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue with ground and orbital telescopes. The James Webb Space Telescope is set to conduct ultraviolet spectroscopy to analyze exotic gases in the comet's coma.</p>
