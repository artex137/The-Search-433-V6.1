      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet's Tail 'Burned Away' by Sun as Scientists Probe 'Tailless' Return</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has re-emerged in the skies after passing perilously close to the Sun in late October, but it is missing its characteristic tail, according to astronomers. The comet, which is a rare interstellar object, was last seen before perihelion, the point of its closest approach to the Sun, when its visibility was obscured by the Sun's glare.</p>

<p>The absence of the comet's tail has puzzled scientists, prompting investigations into the effects of solar radiation on its structure. Researchers are studying the comet to understand how it survived its close encounter with the Sun without disintegrating. This study is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar comet, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object, originating from outside the Solar System.</li>
    <li>It was first detected earlier this year and reached perihelion in late October.</li>
    <li>The comet's tail is missing, raising questions about its interaction with solar heat and radiation.</li>
    <li>Scientists have proposed several theories regarding the missing tail, including vaporization and solar wind effects.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is being observed using ground-based and orbital telescopes to determine its composition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS passed its closest point to the Sun and disappeared from view due to intense solar glare. After moving away from the Sun, astronomers observed that the comet no longer had its signature tail.</p>
<p>Researchers have since initiated studies to explore the comet's composition and survival, focusing on the effects of solar radiation on its structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It's similar to how our skin gets sunburned by UV rays,” said Zhang, a scientist involved in the research. “The UV light breaks apart molecular bonds— in this case, within the comet's gases.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being a rare interstellar visitor, making its study crucial for understanding the origins of planetary systems beyond our own. Its encounter with the Sun adds to a history of comets that have experienced significant changes during close solar approaches, often resulting in fragmentation or vaporization.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it journeys further into space, gathering data that could provide insights into the formation of stars and planets in distant star systems.</p>
