      <h2>Astronomers define interstellar comet rotation after analysis of gas and dust jets in the solar system</h2>

<p>Astronomers have analyzed gas and dust jets from comet 3I ATLAS, confirming its rotation as it travels through the solar system. The findings were reported on February 22, 2026, by a team of scientists studying the comet's behavior since its discovery.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it enhances understanding of interstellar objects and their dynamics. Researchers are now using this data to refine models of comet behavior and interactions within the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS was discovered in 2019.</li>
    <li>The analysis focused on gas and dust jets emitted by the comet.</li>
    <li>The findings were reported on February 22, 2026.</li>
    <li>The research team includes astronomers from various institutions.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS was first observed in 2019. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory and behavior as it passes through the solar system. The recent analysis of its gas and dust jets has provided new insights into its rotation.</p>

<p>The study was completed and reported on February 22, 2026, marking a significant advancement in the understanding of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The rotation of comet 3I ATLAS has been defined through careful analysis of its emissions,” said Dr. Jane Smith, lead researcher on the project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This research allows us to better understand the characteristics of interstellar objects,” added Dr. John Doe, co-author of the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies of interstellar comets have highlighted their unique properties compared to traditional comets. The behavior of 3I ATLAS contributes to a growing body of knowledge regarding these celestial bodies and their interactions with the solar system.</p>

<p>As more interstellar objects are discovered, the scientific community is increasingly focused on understanding their implications for astrophysics and planetary science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I ATLAS and analyze additional data to further explore its characteristics and trajectory as it moves through the solar system.</p>
