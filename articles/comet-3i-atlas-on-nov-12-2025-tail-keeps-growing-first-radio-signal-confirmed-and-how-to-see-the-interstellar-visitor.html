      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-12 19:25 UTC</p>

      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Emerges in Morning Sky with Lengthening Tail</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reappeared in the predawn sky, showcasing a longer and more defined ion tail as it moves through the constellation Virgo. Recent observations on November 11, 2025, confirm that the comet's tail has been growing sharper following its perihelion on October 29–30, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This development is significant for astronomers and enthusiasts alike as it provides new insights into the comet's composition and behavior. The European Space Agency (ESA) is coordinating observations with its JUICE spacecraft throughout November, aiming to gather comprehensive data about 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Observation Date:</strong> November 11, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Low in the eastern sky, moving through Virgo</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Approximately magnitude 11–12</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million km (1.8 AU)</li>
    <li><strong>First Radio Detection:</strong> October 24, 2025, at 1,665 and 1,667 MHz</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Size:</strong> Nucleus estimated between 440 m to 5.6 km across</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation since its discovery in July 2025. Key events include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>October 24, 2025: First radio detection of hydroxyl absorption, confirming cometary activity.</li>
    <li>October 29–30, 2025: Perihelion, when the comet was closest to the Sun.</li>
    <li>November 11, 2025: Enhanced imaging shows a longer, well-defined ion tail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new OH radio detection is precisely the kind of chemistry we expect from a sun-warmed, water-rich comet,” said a spokesperson from the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is delivering water-chemistry signatures in radio, plus a dynamic ion tail in optical images,” noted an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS exhibits typical cometary behavior, including a visible ion tail and hydroxyl signatures, which enhance our understanding of cometary properties across different planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA's JUICE spacecraft will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS throughout November, with data expected to be available in early 2026. Astronomers encourage the public to observe the comet in the morning sky, as it is expected to become more prominent as it approaches its closest point to Earth in December.</p>
