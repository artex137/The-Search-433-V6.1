      <h2>Strange light seen across Ireland caused by US rocket launch</h2>

<p>A "strange light" spotted in the sky across Ireland on Wednesday evening has been attributed to a SpaceX rocket launch from Florida. The light was reported in multiple counties, including Cork, Dublin, Tipperary, and Galway, at approximately 6:30 PM. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The sighting has sparked widespread interest and speculation among stargazers and social media users. Experts have confirmed that the light was likely the result of excess rocket fuel being ejected during the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which sent 29 Starlink satellites into orbit. Authorities have noted that this incident highlights the increasing visibility of satellite launches and their impacts on the night sky.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on Wednesday, at approximately 6:30 PM.</li>
    <li>Reported across counties: Cork, Dublin, Tipperary, Galway.</li>
    <li>SpaceX launched 29 Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral, Florida.</li>
    <li>Experts confirmed the light was due to ejected rocket fuel.</li>
    <li>SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, operates a satellite telecommunications service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At around 6:30 PM on Wednesday, residents across various counties in Ireland observed a bright light moving in the sky. Reports surfaced on social media, describing the light as having a "halo" and moving at "slightly varying speed."</p>

<p>Experts later identified the light as a result of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch, which took place the same evening from Florida. The launch was part of SpaceX's ongoing effort to deploy Starlink satellites for global broadband connectivity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If they keep the fuel in the rocket there is a danger that it will explode and shower debris, so it is a standard practice now for space companies to vent fuel,” said space commentator Leo Enright.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “These damn satellites are getting in the way and the problem is getting worse and worse,” Mr. Enright added, referring to the impact of satellite launches on astronomical observations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a growing trend as satellite launches become more frequent. SpaceX has accelerated its launch schedule, conducting launches nearly every day, which increases the likelihood of similar sightings in the future. Astronomers worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the effects of satellite congestion on their ability to observe celestial events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>AirNav Ireland has been contacted for further comment. Experts continue to monitor the impact of satellite launches on the night sky and the potential implications for astronomical research.</p>
