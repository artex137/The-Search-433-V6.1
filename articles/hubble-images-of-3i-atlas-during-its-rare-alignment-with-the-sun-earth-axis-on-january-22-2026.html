      <h2>Hubble Images of 3I/ATLAS During Its Rare Alignment with the Sun-Earth Axis on January 22, 2026</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS during its rare alignment with the Sun-Earth axis on January 22, 2026. This alignment occurs approximately once every 5.5 years, allowing astronomers to study the comet's characteristics in detail.</p>

<p>This event is significant for the scientific community as it provides a unique opportunity to observe the comet's behavior and composition. Researchers aim to gather data that could enhance understanding of cometary activities and their impact on the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: January 22, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: Near the Sun-Earth axis</li>
    <li>Frequency of alignment: Approximately every 5.5 years</li>
    <li>Observatory: Hubble Space Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2019. Researchers have tracked its path and prepared for its alignment with the Sun-Earth axis since that time. The recent images taken on January 22, 2026, mark a pivotal moment in the study of this comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The alignment provides a rare chance to observe the comet's dynamics and physical properties,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist involved in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader study of comets that have entered the inner solar system. Understanding such comets can help scientists learn more about the early solar system and the formation of planetary bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will analyze the data collected from the Hubble images to gain insights into the comet's composition and trajectory. Further observations may be scheduled during its next alignment.</p>
