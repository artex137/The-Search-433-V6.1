      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: 'Third Ever' Interstellar Object Caught by Oregon Man as It Exits</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar object, known as 3I/ATLAS, has been captured by an amateur astronomer in Portland, Oregon, as it exits our solar system. Patrick Finney took the photograph just as the New Year began, marking a significant moment for astronomy enthusiasts and professionals alike.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is noteworthy as it is only the third extra-solar object detected by humanity, following the asteroid 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and the comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA has confirmed the rarity of the event, prompting interest from the scientific community. Observatories and astronomers have been tracking its trajectory since it was first spotted last summer.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered: Summer 2023 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado</li>
    <li>Perigee: Reached closest approach to Earth on Dec. 19, 2023, at a distance of 270 million km (1.8 AU)</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 58 kilometres per second</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 11 billion years</li>
    <li>Diameter of nucleus: Between 320 metres and 5.6 kilometres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado during the summer of 2023. It was approximately 420 million miles away at that time. The comet reached its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023. Patrick Finney captured its image in Portland, Oregon, on January 1, 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third object in history from outside of our solar system to be discovered within our solar system.” — NASA
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “This is a smart telescope, meaning it has GPS tracking, and can find the object you want to see.” — Patrick Finney
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of interstellar objects is a rare event, with 3I/ATLAS joining the ranks of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These discoveries have provided valuable insights into the composition and dynamics of celestial bodies from outside our solar system. The advancements in telescope technology have enabled amateur astronomers like Finney to contribute significantly to astronomical research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey beyond the solar system, scientists will analyze the data collected from its observations. This will enhance understanding of the comet's characteristics and trajectory, contributing to future studies of interstellar objects.</p>
