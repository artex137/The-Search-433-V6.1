      <h2>Obama: Aliens are real, but I have never seen them</h2>

<p>Former US President Barack Obama has stated that aliens are "real" during a podcast interview with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cowen on February 15, 2026. Although Obama expressed his belief in the existence of aliens, he clarified that he has never personally encountered them.</p>

<p>Obama's comments have reignited public interest and speculation regarding extraterrestrial life, particularly in relation to conspiracy theories centered around Area 51, a high-security military base in Nevada. The US government has previously acknowledged the existence of Area 51, but it has not confirmed any connections to extraterrestrial evidence.</p>
