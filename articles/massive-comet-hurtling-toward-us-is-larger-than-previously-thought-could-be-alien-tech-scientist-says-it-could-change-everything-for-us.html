      <h2>Massive Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth, New Findings Reveal Larger Size</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported that the comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object the size of Manhattan, is larger than previously thought. The object, which was first discovered by NASA on July 1, is being monitored by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb and his team as it travels through the solar system. There are no reported injuries or fatalities connected to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant because it suggests that 3I/ATLAS may have interstellar origins, marking it as only the third known object from beyond the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The team has gathered new data indicating that the mass of 3I/ATLAS exceeds 33 billion tons, according to a blog post by Loeb. Despite its rapid approach, 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered by NASA on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Its mass is estimated to be greater than <strong>33 billion tons</strong>.</li>
    <li>The diameter of its nucleus must be larger than <strong>5 kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>It will pass within <strong>1.67 million miles</strong> of Mars’ orbit around the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is mostly comprised of carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>It is hypothesized to potentially be an alien probe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA discovered 3I/ATLAS. Since then, Avi Loeb and his team have been monitoring the object. Their latest findings, announced in September 2025, reveal that the comet is much larger than previous estimates suggested. The team has also put forth the controversial theory that it could be an alien probe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Given the limited reservoir of heavy elements, we should have discovered on the order of a hundred thousand interstellar objects on the 0.1-kilometer scale of 1I/’Oumuamua before finding 3I/ATLAS, yet we only detected two interstellar objects previously,” Loeb said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The hypothesis in question is that [31/ATLAS] is a technological artifact, and furthermore has active intelligence. If this is the case, then two possibilities follow: first, that its intentions are entirely benign and second, they are malign,” Loeb, along with Adam Drowl and Adam Hibberd, wrote in a paper published on July 17.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These previous findings have sparked interest in the study of interstellar objects and their potential implications for understanding the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As scientists continue to study 3I/ATLAS, more data may emerge regarding its composition and trajectory. Authorities will keep monitoring its approach to ensure that it remains a safe distance from Earth and other planets in the solar system.</p>
