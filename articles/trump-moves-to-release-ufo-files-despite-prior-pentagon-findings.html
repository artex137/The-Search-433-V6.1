      <h2>Trump Moves To Release UFO Files Despite Prior Pentagon Findings</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has announced that he will direct federal agencies to identify and release government files related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and extraterrestrial life. Trump made the announcement on Thursday via a post on Truth Social, stating that he would task the Secretary of War and other relevant departments with this process.</p>

<p>This move comes amid heightened public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial phenomena, following recent comments from former President Barack Obama, who stated that aliens are “real” during a podcast interview. Trump has responded to these remarks, asserting that Obama disclosed classified information and expressing his intention to potentially declassify related materials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Announcement made by President Donald Trump on Thursday via Truth Social.</li>
    <li>Trump directed the Secretary of War and relevant agencies to begin identifying UFO-related files.</li>
    <li>In March 2024, the Department of War’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office released a report on UFO investigations dating back to 1945.</li>
    <li>The report found no evidence linking UAP sightings to extraterrestrial activity.</li>
    <li>A November YouGov poll indicated that 56% of Americans believe aliens exist.</li>
    <li>47% of respondents in the same poll believe extraterrestrials have visited Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2024, the Department of War’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office released a comprehensive report reviewing UFO investigations since 1945. The report concluded that most sightings were misidentified objects or conventional aircraft, with no evidence supporting extraterrestrial links.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Trump announced his intention to release related government files, stating the decision is in response to significant public interest. He commented on Obama's remarks, alleging the former president had disclosed classified information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,” Trump wrote.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“He gave classified information, he’s not supposed to be doing that,” Trump said regarding Obama’s comments. “I don’t know if they’re real or not, but I can tell you he gave classified information.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previously, Trump has expressed skepticism about extraterrestrial life. In a 2019 interview, he stated his doubts and preferred not to delve into the topic. However, he acknowledged during a 2024 podcast that military pilots’ accounts of unidentified encounters have influenced his views.</p>

<p>Trump has a history of directing the release of sensitive government files, including those related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The timeline for the release of the UFO-related files remains unclear. It is uncertain what specific materials will be included in the forthcoming disclosures and whether they will provide new information beyond previous Pentagon reports.</p>
