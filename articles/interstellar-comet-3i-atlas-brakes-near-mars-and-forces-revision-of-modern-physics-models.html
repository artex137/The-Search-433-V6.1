      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas brakes near Mars and forces revision of modern physics models</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has experienced a significant deceleration as it approaches Mars, prompting scientists to reassess current models of modern physics. The event occurred on February 21, 2026, but details regarding any potential impacts on Mars or surrounding areas have not been disclosed.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is critical as it challenges existing scientific theories about comet behavior and the forces acting upon them. Researchers from various space agencies, including NASA and ESA, are currently analyzing the data collected from this encounter to understand the implications for future interstellar travel and the nature of comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas has been observed decelerating near Mars.</li>
    <li>The event occurred on February 21, 2026.</li>
    <li>Authorities involved include NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA).</li>
    <li>Details on potential impacts have not been disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 21, 2026, astronomers noted a marked change in the trajectory of comet 3I/Atlas as it approached Mars. Initial observations indicated an unexpected braking effect, leading to further investigation by space agencies.</p>

<p>Following the event, researchers have begun to gather and analyze data to understand the physical forces at play, marking a significant moment in the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This unexpected behavior of comet 3I/Atlas raises important questions about our understanding of gravitational forces and comet dynamics,” said Dr. Emily Jordan, a leading astrophysicist at NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a series of observations of interstellar objects entering the solar system, including the well-known Oumuamua. The study of these objects has sparked interest in the scientific community regarding the nature of outer space and its effects on physical laws.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from comet 3I/Atlas and may propose revisions to existing physics models based on their findings. Further studies and observations are expected in the coming months.</p>
