      <h2>3I/ATLAS: One Last Chance To Observe Exocomet As It Enters Rare ‘Full Moon Phase’ On Early Morning Jan 23</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, will be visible on January 23 at 5 a.m. IST as it enters a rare “full moon phase.” This event marks a significant moment for astronomers as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>

<p>The observation is crucial for scientists studying the exocomet, which was first spotted by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025. Authorities, including NASA and ESA, are preparing to capture data during the comet's upcoming flyby of the Jovian satellite Eupheme on March 16.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: January 23, 2026</li>
    <li>Observation Time: 5 a.m. IST</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Next rendezvous: March 16, 2026, with the Jovian satellite Eupheme</li>
    <li>Data collection by NASA and ESA probes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the interstellar boundaries approximately 8,000 years ago. It was detected by ATLAS on July 1, 2025. The comet reached perihelion on October 27, 2025, which was expected to destroy it. Instead, it displayed multiple jets, including an anti-tail extending toward the sun. On December 19, 2025, it made its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<p>As of January 23, 2026, the comet will be streamed live by The Virtual Telescope Project based in Italy, as it enters its “full moon phase.”</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has noted that recent images from the Hubble Space Telescope show three symmetrical mini-jets on 3I/ATLAS. He has flagged a total of 18 anomalies associated with the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in our solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet's unique characteristics have prompted extensive study, particularly regarding its unexpected jets and potential technological signatures.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data collected from the comet's flyby will be processed over the coming months, providing insights into its composition and behavior. Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Eupheme.</p>
