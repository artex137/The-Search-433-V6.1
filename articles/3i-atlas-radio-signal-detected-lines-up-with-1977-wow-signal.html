      <h2>3I/ATLAS Radio Signal Detected, Lines Up With 1977 'Wow! Signal'</h2>

<p>Researchers have detected a radio signal from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, marking a significant breakthrough in its observation. The signal was captured on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT radio telescope at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) after two prior attempts on September 20 and 28 failed. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this discovery.</p>

<p>This detection has elevated 3I/ATLAS from a mere comet to a primary target for scientists investigating potential extraterrestrial life. The discovery has reignited interest in the possibility that the object may be linked to the unexplained 'Wow! Signal' detected in 1977. Researchers are now analyzing the data and planning further observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detection date: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO)</li>
    <li>Previous detection attempts: September 20 and 28, 2025</li>
    <li>Angular separation from the Sun at detection: 3.76 degrees</li>
    <li>Distance between 3I/ATLAS and the Sun: 1.38 times that of Earth and the Sun</li>
    <li>Detected frequencies: 1.665 and 1.667 gigahertz</li>
    <li>Temperature of emitted hydroxyl radicals: ~230 degrees Kelvin</li>
    <li>Next scheduled observation: March 16, 2026, by the Juno spacecraft</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025. After displaying unusual behaviour, including a lack of a visible tail, researchers attempted to detect radio signals on September 20 and 28, 2025, but were unsuccessful. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT telescope successfully detected hydroxyl absorption lines from the object.</p>

<p>The connection to the 'Wow! Signal' was noted by Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, who highlighted the alignment of 3I/ATLAS's arrival direction with that of the 1977 signal, suggesting a 0.6 percent chance that this coincidence is random.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb noted, "The detection of the OH absorption signal results from the full speed of 3I/ATLAS relative to Earth."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also expressed hope, stating, "I anticipate that more information will be gathered as the object continues its journey."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 'Wow! Signal' was detected on August 15, 1977, by SETI astronomer Jerry R. Ehman, who famously wrote 'Wow' on the printout. The signal's intensity suggested a source power equivalent to that of a typical nuclear reactor. The potential connection to 3I/ATLAS adds a new layer to the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, with the Juno spacecraft scheduled to search for further radio signals when the object is 53 million kilometres from Jupiter on March 16, 2026. The scientific community remains eager for more data to explore the implications of this discovery.</p>
