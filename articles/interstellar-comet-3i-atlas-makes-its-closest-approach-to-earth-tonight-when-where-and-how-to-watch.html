      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS makes its closest approach to Earth tonight</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth at 1 AM EST (0600 GMT) on December 19, 2023. The comet is approximately 1.8 astronomical units away, which is about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) from our planet. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS is significant for astronomers who have been monitoring the object since its discovery on July 1, 2023, by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope network in Chile. This comet is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following 1I/Ê»Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth or any other celestial body.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: 1 AM EST (0600 GMT) on December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 1.8 astronomical units (168 million miles or 270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar comets: 1I/Ê»Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>Visibility: Not visible to the naked eye</li>
    <li>Recommended telescope aperture: At least 30 centimeters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope network in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet has been tracked as it approaches Earth, revealing its steep, hyperbolic path indicating it did not originate from our solar system.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves closer to Earth, heat from the Sun causes its icy nucleus to release dust and gases. Astronomers have been capturing images and data from various observatories, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the JUICE Jupiter probe, leading up to its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet poses no threat to Earth or any other planet,” a NASA representative confirmed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The European Space Agency stated, “The flyby is entirely safe.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object observed passing through our solar system. Its study offers scientific insights into materials formed around other star systems, enhancing our understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>This event highlights the importance of ongoing astronomical observations, particularly as comets like 3I/ATLAS provide unique opportunities to study interstellar matter.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet continues its journey, astronomers will analyze the data collected during its closest approach. Observatories will remain focused on 3I/ATLAS until it fades from view, providing valuable insights into interstellar objects.</p>
