      <h2>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS intrigues scientists with its atypical dust and lack of common tail</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, confirmed as the third known visitor to our Solar System, has drawn significant attention from the global astronomical community since its detection on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) in Hawaii. The comet's unique characteristics challenge existing models of comet formation and evolution, particularly due to its unusual dust composition and the absence of a typical cometary tail.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it provides insights into the conditions of protoplanetary disks in other planetary systems. Agencies like NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have mobilized their observatories to study 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun, gathering crucial data to understand its origins and the diversity of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First detected: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Detection location: Hawaii</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 2025, approximately 1.8 astronomical units (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Initial designation: A11pl3Z</li>
    <li>Confirmed as third interstellar visitor, following ‘Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>Rotation period: approximately 7.1 hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS survey on July 1, 2025. Initial observations indicated a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin. This led to a brief alert regarding its potential threat to Earth, as it was temporarily cataloged as CE2XZW2 by the Minor Planet Center. Further analysis corrected this assessment, establishing that it posed no danger. The closest point of approach to Earth occurred in December 2025, at a safe distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units.</p>

<p>As the comet moved closer to perihelion in October 2025, it began its trajectory away from the Sun, with measurements confirming its hyperbolic speed, sufficient to escape the Sun's gravitational pull.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS provide a rare window into the conditions of other planetary systems,” said astronomer Sergei Yazev. “Its lack of a visible tail suggests different processes at play compared to our native comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins a growing list of interstellar visitors, including ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. While ‘Oumuamua was a rocky object with no cometary activity, 2I/Borisov exhibited behavior similar to long-period comets from our Solar System. The hybrid profile of 3I/ATLAS, with its cometary activity but absence of a tail, highlights the diversity of interstellar objects and suggests varied planetary formation processes across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations will continue as telescopes around the world monitor 3I/ATLAS. Scientists will analyze the data collected to refine theories about the formation of celestial bodies in different stellar environments, adding to the understanding of interstellar space.</p>
