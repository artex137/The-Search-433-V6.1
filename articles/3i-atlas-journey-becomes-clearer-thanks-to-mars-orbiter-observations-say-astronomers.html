      <h2>3I/Atlas’ journey becomes clearer thanks to Mars Orbiter observations, say astronomers</h2>

<p>Astronomers have gained a clearer understanding of the trajectory of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, thanks to observations from two Mars-orbiting spacecraft. The comet, first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Gemini South Observatory, is only the third interstellar object recorded passing through our Solar System.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it enhances the accuracy of tracking the comet's path, which is crucial for ongoing research into its origins and composition. The European Space Agency's (ESA) Near-Earth Object Coordination Center (NEOCC) has taken the lead in analyzing the comet's movements using data from both Earth-based telescopes and the Mars orbiters, marking a pioneering approach in interstellar object tracking.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently moving at almost <strong>250,000 km/h</strong>.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of <strong>270 million kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>The observations were made by ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express.</li>
    <li>The accuracy of the comet's predicted path has improved by <strong>10 times</strong> due to the new data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected 3I/Atlas at the Gemini South Observatory. They tracked its movements using telescopes on Earth. By October 2025, the comet approached Mars closely enough for ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express to capture its trajectory from a new vantage point. This collaboration has allowed for a significant improvement in tracking accuracy.</p>

<p>3I/Atlas passed its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, and is on course for its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is the first time in history that data from a spacecraft orbiting another planet has been used to map the trajectory of an interstellar object,” said a spokesperson from ESA’s NEOCC.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The tracking of 3I/Atlas marks a critical advancement in planetary defense methodologies. Previous efforts have primarily focused on monitoring asteroids that may pose a threat to Earth. This initiative demonstrates the potential of integrating data from various sources across the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its journey, ESA plans to utilize additional missions, such as the JUICE spacecraft, to gather more data. Future missions like Comet Interceptor and NEOMIR are also in preparation to study upcoming comets in greater detail.</p>
