      <h2>Lawmakers Reveal Video Of Hellfire Missile That Struck UFO With Little Effect</h2>

<p>During a Congressional hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) on Tuesday, lawmakers presented a video showing an AGM-114 Hellfire missile fired from an MQ-9 Reaper drone striking an orb-shaped UFO, which continued to travel at high speed with little damage. The hearing took place in Washington, D.C., with no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This hearing, titled “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection,” is significant as it aims to promote transparency regarding UAPs and protect whistleblowers within the military and government. Lawmakers and witnesses have raised concerns about the lack of access to critical information regarding UAP encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: Tuesday, not disclosed</li>
    <li>Location: Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Key witnesses: U.S. Air Force veterans Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Dylan Borland, Chief Alexandro Wiggins, investigative journalist George Knapp</li>
    <li>Video recorded: October 2024, off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Proposed legislation: UAP Whistleblower Protection Act (H.R. 5060)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the hearing, Rep. Eric Burlison (R-MO) presented the video footage of the missile striking the UFO. The missile, launched from an MQ-9 Reaper drone, appeared to bounce off the object without causing damage. Witnesses testified about their personal experiences with UAPs, including multiple incidents documented at Vandenberg Air Force Base.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Nuccetelli shared details of a 2003 sighting involving a “massive, glowing red square” and a personal encounter with a sphere of light. Dylan Borland described a 2012 incident involving an equilateral triangle craft that interfered with his cell phone and exhibited unusual flight characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That’s a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO, and just bounced right off — and it kept going,” said investigative journalist George Knapp.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It kept going, and it looks like the debris was taken with it,” added Rep. Eric Burlison.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Each incident was witnessed by multiple personnel, documented, investigated, and reported up the chain of command,” stated Jeffrey Nuccetelli.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing follows previous testimonies on UAPs, including notable remarks from whistleblower David Grusch in July 2023. Lawmakers have emphasized the need for transparency regarding UAP incidents and the protection of whistleblowers who report such encounters. The proposed UAP Whistleblower Protection Act aims to address these concerns.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers plan to continue discussions on UAP transparency and whistleblower protections, with further investigations into UAP incidents expected. The status of the UAP Disclosure Act remains uncertain as it faces challenges within Congress.</p>
