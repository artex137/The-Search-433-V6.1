      <h2>Solid Core of 3I/ATLAS Still Cannot Be Directly Seen, Hubble Reveals</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention online following the circulation of a fabricated image suggesting it is an alien artefact. The image has prompted speculation about its authenticity, despite official NASA views showing low-resolution images of the comet.</p>

<p>This matter highlights the gap between artistic renderings and scientific reality, resulting in the spread of misinformation. Authorities such as NASA have emphasized that current telescopes cannot directly resolve the solid core of 3I/ATLAS, which remains distant and faint.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently too distant for telescopes to resolve its solid core.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth is approximately 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The object has an angular size of about 0.02 arc-seconds.</li>
    <li>NASA's official images show a faint coma and tail, not a clearly defined object.</li>
    <li>No high-definition images of 3I/ATLAS have been released.</li>
    <li>The viral image has no provenance and lacks scientific detail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The recent speculation surrounding 3I/ATLAS began when a stylized image was shared on social media platforms, including X and Instagram. The image was initially posted by the account UFO mania, prompting discussions about its authenticity.</p>
<p>Experts and astronomers have since responded, clarifying that the solid core of 3I/ATLAS cannot be seen with current technology. NASA's views on the object have remained consistent, focusing on its comet-like characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Neither NASA's nor anybody else's images of 3I/ATLAS itself—its 3-km nucleus—are worth a damn,” said Michael McNeil in response to the viral image.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things,” stated NASA small bodies lead scientist Tom Statler, rejecting claims of alien origins.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Though the Hubble images put tighter constraints on the size of the nucleus compared to previous ground-based estimates, the solid heart of the comet presently cannot be directly seen, even by Hubble,” according to a NASA Science report.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is not the first time that images of celestial objects have sparked speculation about their nature. Previous cases have similarly seen the blending of artistic representations with scientific data, leading to public confusion. NASA has consistently emphasized the importance of relying on verified data to understand celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS and plans to release more data as it becomes available. The agency has stated that there is no danger to Earth from the comet, which will not come closer than 270 million kilometres to our planet.</p>
