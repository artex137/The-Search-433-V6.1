      <h2>3I/ATLAS shows sunward anti-tail in latest Hubble images</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been reobserved by the Hubble Space Telescope on November 30, 2025, at a distance of 286 million kilometers from Earth. The latest images reveal a teardrop-shaped coma with a sunward anti-tail, a feature also noted in a pre-perihelion image from July 21, 2025.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insights into the behavior and composition of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches and moves away from the Sun. NASA has confirmed that the Wide Field Camera 3 on Hubble captured these recent images, and observations are expected to continue as the comet travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 286 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Previous observation date: July 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Radius of the coma: approximately 40,000 kilometers</li>
    <li>Length of anti-tail: approximately 60,000 kilometers</li>
    <li>Instrument used: Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, Hubble captured pre-perihelion images of 3I/ATLAS as it approached the Sun from a distance 56% larger than on November 30, 2025. During this time, the comet exhibited a teardrop-shaped coma.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2025, Hubble reobserved 3I/ATLAS, revealing the sunward anti-tail and confirming its movement across the sky relative to background stars.</p>
<p>NASA expects to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves further away from the Sun, providing further data on its characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb reported that the configuration of 3I/ATLAS corresponds to the presence of a large number of macroscopic non-volatile objects that separated from the main body due to its measured non-gravitational acceleration away from the Sun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nasa noted that Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 captured these images at a distance of 178 million miles, confirming the comet’s movement across the sky relative to background stars.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS add to the growing body of research on interstellar objects. Previous studies have highlighted the unique characteristics and behaviors of such objects as they travel through the solar system. The non-gravitational acceleration observed in 3I/ATLAS is consistent with phenomena seen in other comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to release the full Hubble data set, which will include ultraviolet spectroscopy, expected to provide additional information on the composition of the gas and material surrounding 3I/ATLAS. Amateur astronomers are also continuing to capture large-scale images of the comet.</p>
