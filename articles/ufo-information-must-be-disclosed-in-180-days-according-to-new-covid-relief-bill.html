      <h2>UFO Information Must Be Disclosed in 180 Days According to New Covid Relief Bill</h2>

<p>A 180-day countdown for UFO disclosure has begun following President Donald Trump's signing of a Covid-19 stimulus bill on December 27, 2020. At the end of this period, U.S. intelligence agencies will be required to share what they know about unidentified flying objects with the public. The UFO provision was not included in the main text of the nearly 6,000-word bill, but was added as a "committee comment" to the annual intelligence authorization act.</p>

<p>This disclosure is significant as it represents a shift in government transparency regarding UFOs, a topic of interest for both the public and researchers. The Senate Intelligence Committee, chaired by Florida Senator Marco Rubio, has indicated its support for the provision, highlighting a growing demand for accountability and information from intelligence agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>President Trump signed the $2.3 trillion Covid-19 stimulus bill on December 27, 2020.</li>
    <li>The UFO disclosure requirement mandates information release within 180 days.</li>
    <li>The UFO provision was added as a "committee comment" to the annual intelligence authorization act.</li>
    <li>The bill also classifies illegal streaming for commercial profit as a felony.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Covid-19 stimulus bill, which included various provisions to aid the economy during the pandemic. Among these was a requirement for intelligence agencies to disclose information about UFOs within 180 days.</p>
<p>The Senate Intelligence Committee has expressed interest in the UFO provision, reflecting a broader push for transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We need to know what the government knows about UFOs,” said Florida Senator Marco Rubio, emphasizing the importance of transparency in national security matters.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This move follows years of speculation and interest in UFOs, particularly after the release of military videos showing unidentified aerial phenomena. Public interest in UFOs has surged, leading to calls for more information from government sources.</p>
<p>Previous government reports have indicated that UFO sightings remain unexplained, prompting a desire for further investigation and disclosure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming months, intelligence agencies are expected to prepare their reports on UFOs, which must be submitted by June 2021. The outcome of this disclosure could influence future policies and public perception of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
