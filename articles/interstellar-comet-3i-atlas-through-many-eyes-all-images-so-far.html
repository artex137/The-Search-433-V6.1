      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Captured by Telescopes Worldwide</h2>

<p>Astronomers have documented images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile. This comet, originating from beyond our Solar System, has attracted attention due to its unique characteristics and the brief window in which it can be observed.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS marks only the third time an interstellar comet has been identified. Observatories around the globe have mobilized to capture its journey, utilizing various imaging techniques to reveal its structure, color, and chemical composition. The collaborative effort highlights advancements in astronomical photography and the significance of studying interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>First spotted by ATLAS in Chile.</li>
    <li>Photographed by multiple telescopes including ATLAS, CFHT, Gemini North, VLT, and Hubble.</li>
    <li>Only the third interstellar comet identified in history.</li>
    <li>Observations have shown the comet's coma and tail structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile captured the initial image of 3I/ATLAS, revealing its cometary nature. Following this, the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) provided detailed images showing the comet's coma and early dust tail. The Gemini North telescope then captured precise images of the comet's core, allowing for measurements of dust grain sizes.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile produced high-resolution images that distinguished jets of material from the comet's nucleus. Finally, the Hubble Space Telescope provided the first space-based images of the comet on July 21, 2025, highlighting its dust halo and gas emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These images reveal how telescopes record much more than points of light. They show structure, color, texture, and chemical fingerprints,” said astronomer Soumyadeep Mukherjee.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of interstellar comets is rare, with only two previous instances documented prior to 3I/ATLAS. The ability to capture detailed images of such objects enhances our understanding of the materials and processes that exist beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the images collected from various telescopes to gain insights into the comet's composition and behavior as it moves through the Solar System. Further studies will focus on the dynamics of interstellar objects and their implications for understanding cosmic phenomena.</p>
