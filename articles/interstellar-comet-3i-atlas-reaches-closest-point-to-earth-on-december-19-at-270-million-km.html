      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaches closest point to Earth on December 19 at 270 million km</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to traverse the Solar System, will reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers. The comet poses no risk of collision with the planet, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers and space agencies, as it offers a rare opportunity to study the comet's composition and behavior. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have increased their observational efforts since the comet's discovery in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 270 million kilometers (1.8 astronomical units)</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest point to the Sun): October 29, 203 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet speed: approximately 210,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus diameter: between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Brightness: reached magnitude 7-8 in October, seven times brighter than expected</li>
    <li>Next close approach: within 50 million kilometers of Jupiter on March 16, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, as a magnitude 17 object, only visible with advanced equipment. Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21 revealed a faint coma and tail. By October 3, the comet passed within 28 million kilometers of Mars, allowing for further observations by various probes.</p>
<p>On October 29, the comet reached perihelion, and its speed increased from 61 km/s to 68 km/s. The brightness of the comet peaked in October, and it has remained under observation by both ground-based and space telescopes. The comet will continue to be visible until September 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet provides a unique opportunity to study the materials that existed in the early solar system,” said Qicheng Zhang from the Lowell Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its hyperbolic trajectory, suggesting it originated from outside the Solar System, possibly from the thick disk of the Milky Way. Its activity, characterized by cryovolcanism, has been observed since May 2025, challenging traditional comet models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue monitoring the comet's behavior as it approaches its closest point to Earth. Full data transmission from ongoing missions is expected between February 18 and 20, 2026, which will enhance understanding of the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>
