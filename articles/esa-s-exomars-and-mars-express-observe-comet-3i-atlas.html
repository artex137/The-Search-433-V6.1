      <h2>ESA’s ExoMars and Mars Express observe comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Between 1 and 7 October, the European Space Agency’s (ESA) ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express spacecraft have observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed close to Mars. The comet was approximately 30 million kilometres away from the Mars orbiters during its closest approach on 3 October.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks a rare opportunity for scientists to study a comet from outside the Solar System. The two spacecraft provided the best view of the comet among ESA's fleet. Scientists are currently analysing the data collected from both orbiters to gain insights into the comet's composition and behaviour as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observations: 1–7 October 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: 3 October 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars orbiters: 30 million km</li>
    <li>Instruments used: CaSSIS on ExoMars TGO, cameras on Mars Express</li>
    <li>First spotted: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated age: up to 3 billion years older than the Solar System</li>
    <li>Next observation planned: Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) in November 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory using various telescopes. During 1–7 October 2023, ESA’s ExoMars TGO and Mars Express conducted observations of the comet as it approached Mars.</p>
<p>On 3 October 2023, the comet reached its closest point to Mars, allowing both orbiters to capture images of the comet's coma, although the nucleus remained indistinguishable due to its distance.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target,” said Nick Thomas, Principal Investigator of the CaSSIS camera.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one. I look forward to seeing what the data reveals following further analysis,” stated Colin Wilson, Mars Express and ExoMars project scientist at ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet observed, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These comets provide unique insights into the formation of worlds beyond our Solar System. The study of such interstellar objects is crucial for understanding the broader galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyse data from the ExoMars TGO and Mars Express over the coming weeks and months. The next observation of comet 3I/ATLAS is scheduled for November 2023 with the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice), which will capture the comet shortly after its closest approach to the Sun.</p>
