      <h2>International Gemini Observatory Captures Glowing Image of Exocomet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The International Gemini Observatory has captured a glowing image of Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The image was taken on 26 November 2025, using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) at Gemini North in Maunakea, Hawai‘i. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object, has returned to view after weeks behind the Sun. The observatory noted that the comet will make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, coinciding with a full moon, which will provide a striking view of the exocomet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: 26 November 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Gemini North, Maunakea, Hawai‘i</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 1.79 AU (astronomical units)</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the 3rd confirmed interstellar object</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 26 November 2025, the International Gemini Observatory conducted a Shadow the Scientists session and captured images of 3I/ATLAS. The comet emerged from behind the Sun and reappeared near the star Zaniah in the constellation Virgo. Researchers noted the comet's faint greenish glow, attributed to light emitted by gases in the comet's coma.</p>

<p>The observatory released the new images on 12 December 2025, highlighting the comet's unique features and its upcoming closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“In the new image released today, it appears to have a faint greenish glow. This is due to light emitted by gases in the comet’s coma that are evaporating as the comet heats up.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“After weeks behind the Sun, Comet 3I/ATLAS has returned to view.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third confirmed interstellar object observed. Its previous appearances have drawn attention from astronomers and the public alike, as interstellar objects provide insights into the composition and dynamics of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. The comet is expected to exit the solar system next year, following its close encounter with Earth.</p>
