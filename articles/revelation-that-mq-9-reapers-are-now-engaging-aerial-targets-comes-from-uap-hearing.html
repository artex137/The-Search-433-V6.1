      <h2>U.S. MQ-9 Reapers Engage Aerial Target Off Yemen Coast</h2>

<p>A video has emerged showing U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones attempting to intercept an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. The video, presented by Rep. Eric Burlison during a House Oversight Committee hearing on September 9, 2025, appears to mark the first recorded instance of a Reaper engaging an aerial target in an operational setting. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it highlights the evolving capabilities of drone technology and raises questions about U.S. military operations concerning unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities are currently reviewing the footage, which was reportedly provided by a whistleblower, while the Pentagon and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) have not commented on the specifics of the incident.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video shows an MQ-9 Reaper tracking an unidentified object on October 30, 2024.</li>
    <li>The object was reportedly struck by an AGM-114 Hellfire missile, but did not detonate.</li>
    <li>The hearing focused on U.S. government transparency regarding UAP.</li>
    <li>The drone engagement took place off the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>Rep. Eric Burlison presented the video during the hearing on September 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>No information has been provided by the Pentagon or CENTCOM regarding the incident.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone tracked an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen. During this engagement, a second Reaper launched an AGM-114 Hellfire missile at the object. The missile struck the target but failed to detonate, and the object continued on its path.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2025, Rep. Eric Burlison presented the video of this incident during a House Oversight Committee hearing, highlighting the need for transparency regarding UAP.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You’ll see that another MQ-9 launched a[n AGM-114] Hellfire missile that – you cannot see that [other] drone,” Rep. Eric Burlison said during the hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’m not going to speculate what it is,” Burlison added, referring to the unidentified object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Houthis, an Iran-backed militant group in Yemen, have been involved in ongoing attacks on ships and targets in the region since October 2023. U.S. air and naval forces have actively responded to these threats, with MQ-9 drones playing a key role in operations. The potential for MQ-9s to engage aerial targets is not entirely new, as previous tests have demonstrated their capabilities in this area.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>An independent review of the video is ongoing. Authorities are expected to provide further information as investigations into the incident continue.</p>
