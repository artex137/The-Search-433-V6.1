      <h2>Brazil News 2025: Social Security Adjustments and NASA’s 3I Atlas Comet Mission Shape a Year of Change</h2>

<p>As 2025 begins, Social Security adjustments and NASA’s mission to study the comet 3I Atlas are set to define a pivotal year for Brazil and the globe. The adjustments to Social Security are aimed at addressing long-term solvency issues, while NASA's campaign focuses on understanding the comet's disintegration that occurred in 2020.</p>

<p>These developments are significant as they reflect broader global discussions on social welfare and scientific exploration. Lawmakers and scientists are responding to pressing challenges, with Social Security facing increased scrutiny over its future, and NASA embarking on a collaborative mission to investigate cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Social Security's annual Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) for 2025 is projected at <strong>3.2%</strong>.</li>
    <li>The adjustment is calculated using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).</li>
    <li>The Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund may cover only <strong>79%</strong> of scheduled benefits by <strong>2033</strong> without legislative changes.</li>
    <li>NASA is launching its 3I Atlas mission in <strong>2025</strong> to study the remnants of comet C/2019 Y4 ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered in <strong>December 2019</strong> and broke apart in <strong>2020</strong>.</li>
    <li>The mission will utilize high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope and radar mapping from orbital assets.</li>
    <li>The project involves partnerships with the European Space Agency and global observatories.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2019, comet C/2019 Y4 ATLAS is discovered, initially promising a spectacular sight. However, in 2020, the comet unexpectedly disintegrates, providing scientists with a unique opportunity to study its interior. As of 2025, NASA is set to launch a mission to investigate the remains of 3I Atlas, leveraging advanced technology and international collaboration.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Social Security adjustments are being implemented in response to ongoing economic pressures and demographic shifts. The projected COLA of 3.2% for 2025 aims to alleviate some financial strain for beneficiaries amidst rising costs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Social Security adjustments reflect our commitment to support millions relying on these benefits, even as we confront serious long-term funding challenges,” a spokesperson for the Social Security Administration said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“NASA’s 3I Atlas mission is a landmark opportunity to understand the processes that shape our solar system. The collaboration with international partners highlights the importance of shared scientific exploration,” said a NASA official.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The adjustments to Social Security come at a time when many countries, including Brazil, are grappling with similar demographic challenges. An aging population and declining birth rates are straining public pension systems worldwide. In the U.S., lawmakers are considering various reform options to enhance the program's long-term viability.</p>

<p>NASA's 3I Atlas mission is part of a broader trend of increased observation campaigns that often lead to significant discoveries in astronomy. Previous missions have provided insights into the origins of comets and asteroids, enhancing our understanding of the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 2025 unfolds, policymakers will continue to debate reforms to Social Security, with potential changes to tax rates and retirement ages on the table. Meanwhile, NASA’s 3I Atlas mission is expected to commence, with data collection and analysis set to provide new insights into cometary evolution and the early solar system.</p>
