      <h2>A risky maneuver could send a spacecraft to interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Here's the plan</h2>

<p>A proposed spacecraft mission aimed at interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could launch in 2035 and potentially reach the comet by 2085, according to researchers. The spacecraft would utilize a risky maneuver involving a close approach to the sun to gain enough speed to catch up with the comet, which is currently moving away from Earth.</p>

<p>This mission is significant as it represents a potential advancement in interstellar exploration. Researchers believe that by taking advantage of the Oberth effect—a principle that allows spacecraft to accelerate more efficiently during close approaches to massive bodies—they can achieve the necessary velocity to meet 3I/ATLAS at a distance of 732 astronomical units from the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Proposed launch year: 2035</li>
    <li>Estimated arrival year: 2085</li>
    <li>Distance from the sun at closest approach: 732 AU (68 billion miles / 109 billion kilometers)</li>
    <li>Mass of the spacecraft: approximately 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds)</li>
    <li>Velocity needed for the mission: at least 8.4 kilometers per second (5.1 miles per second)</li>
    <li>Closest approach distance to the sun: 3.2 solar radii (approximately 0.015 AU)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Research indicates that the mission would first involve launching the spacecraft in 2035. After a year-long journey to Jupiter, the spacecraft would then loop back towards the sun to execute the Oberth maneuver. This maneuver would occur at the closest approach to the sun, allowing the spacecraft to gain the necessary velocity to intercept 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>Once launched, the spacecraft would take approximately 50 years to reach the comet, arriving in 2085. The researchers have highlighted the importance of precise timing and trajectory in successfully executing this mission.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Pretty much every launch uses the Oberth effect,” said T. Marshall Eubanks, chief scientist at Space Initiatives Inc. “However, I cannot find a record of a straight-out Oberth maneuver of the type we propose.” 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “In principle, a similar heat shield could be used for the mission to 3I/ATLAS,” said Adam Hibberd, lead author of the research. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Oberth effect has been utilized in numerous space missions, allowing spacecraft to achieve greater velocity during close-approach maneuvers. The proposed mission represents a novel application of this principle, as it involves a significant rocket burn at the closest approach to the sun, a maneuver not previously documented.</p>

<p>NASA's Parker Solar Probe, which made its closest approach to the sun in 2023, serves as a reference point for the proposed mission. The probe successfully navigated extreme temperatures and conditions, demonstrating the feasibility of approaching the sun closely.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to refine their plans and designs for the spacecraft, focusing on heat shield technology and trajectory calculations. The timeline for the mission will depend on further developments in space exploration technology and funding availability.</p>
