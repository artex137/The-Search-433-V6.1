      <h2>Hubble Captures Streaky Tail of Third Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been captured in new images by the Hubble Space Telescope as it travels through our solar system, nearing its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet exhibits a highly unusual tail, blending dust and gas in a manner rarely observed in other comets.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Scientists are working to understand the comet's composition and behavior before it disappears from view. The comet's unique features, including its dual tails and high carbon dioxide ratios, have sparked interest in the astronomical community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, just inside Mars' orbit.</li>
    <li>Hubble's latest images were taken on November 30, 2025, when the comet was 286 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet will be closest to Earth at 274 million kilometres on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Size estimates of the comet vary from 427 to 440 metres.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers first detected the comet using the ATLAS telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. Shortly after, its hyperbolic trajectory confirmed it as an interstellar object. The comet passed perihelion on October 29, 2025, and Hubble captured images of it on November 30, 2025. It is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Hubble tracked the comet as it moved across the sky. As a result, background stars appear as streaks of light,” ESA Hubble account noted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“NASA's Hubble and ESA's Juice spacecraft have captured stunning new images of comet 3I/ATLAS as it nears its closest approach,” WION reported.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed in our solar system. Previous interstellar comets, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have prompted discussions about the nature of celestial bodies from outside our solar system. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS may provide further insights into the composition of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, scientists will continue to analyze data from various space missions to better understand its properties and behavior. Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope and ESA's Juice spacecraft will contribute to ongoing research.</p>
