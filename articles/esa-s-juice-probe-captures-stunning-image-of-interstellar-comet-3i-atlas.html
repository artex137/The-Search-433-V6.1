      <h2>ESA's JUICE Probe Captures Stunning Image of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft has captured a new image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known object from beyond our Solar System, during its mission to Jupiter. The image was taken by the JUICE probe on November 2, 2025, and offers a close-up view of the comet's activity.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. The data from several instruments onboard the JUICE probe will not be fully available until early 2026, but early images have already generated excitement in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile.</li>
    <li>JUICE probe captured the first image of 3I/ATLAS on November 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet has a hyperbolic orbit, indicating it is not part of our Solar System.</li>
    <li>Initial image shows activity, including a glowing halo and two tails.</li>
    <li>Full scientific data from JUICE will arrive on Earth by February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile identified comet 3I/ATLAS. This marked its recognition as the third interstellar object detected. Following this, the JUICE probe, which is equipped to explore Jupiter's icy moons, shifted its focus to 3I/ATLAS between November 2 and November 25, 2025. On November 2, the probe's Navigation Camera took its first image of the comet.</p>

<p>The image revealed significant activity around the comet, including a bright coma and indications of two distinct tails. This observation occurred shortly after the comet’s perihelion, when it was closest to the Sun, prompting increased activity due to the evaporation of ices.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The very clearly visible comet, surrounded by signs of activity, surprised us,” said a member of the JUICE team. “Not only do we clearly see the glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet known as its coma, we also see a hint of two tails.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Only two other interstellar comets, 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, have been validated before 3I/ATLAS. The rarity of such objects makes the current observations particularly valuable for understanding the formation of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers expect to receive detailed data from all five scientific instruments on the JUICE probe in the coming months. This will include high-resolution images and spectroscopic analysis to determine the chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
