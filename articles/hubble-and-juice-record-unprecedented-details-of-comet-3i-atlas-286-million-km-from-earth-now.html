      <h2>Hubble and Juice Record Unprecedented Details of Comet 3I/ATLAS 286 Million km from Earth</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured detailed images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on November 30, 2025, while it was 286 million kilometers from Earth. This observation occurred shortly after the comet's perihelion in October, revealing a bright water droplet-shaped coma surrounding its nucleus.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the Solar System, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile. Astronomers from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are currently coordinating efforts to analyze the comet’s hyperbolic trajectory, which indicates its origin outside the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at approximately 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter ranges between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Composition includes hydrogen cyanide, methanol, and nickel at high levels.</li>
    <li>Initial detection occurred during routine scans designed for terrestrial impact warnings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, during routine scans by the ATLAS system. Hubble obtained its first images of the comet in July, revealing a faint coma and a broad tail pointing east. Subsequent observations tracked its acceleration and brightness, with variations every 16 hours.</p>

<p>In August 2025, spectroscopy from the Very Large Telescope detected cyanide and nickel in the comet's coma. The JUICE probe, launched by the ESA in 2023, observed the comet in November, 66 million kilometers away, capturing images of its visible coma and plasma tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The presence of volatile molecules such as carbon dioxide and water ice confirms the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS,” said a spokesperson from NASA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar comets. Prior objects, such as 2I/Borisov, have shown different characteristics, emphasizing the diversity of these celestial bodies. The ongoing monitoring of 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader initiative to study cosmic phenomena and their implications for understanding the origins of our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS until its exit from the Solar System in 2028. Data from various missions will contribute to ongoing analyses of the comet's composition and trajectory.</p>
