      <h2>Trump moves to make alien, UFO records public</h2>

<p>US President Donald Trump has announced plans to direct federal agencies to release government files related to aliens and unidentified flying objects (UFOs) as of Thursday, citing strong public interest in the topic. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this announcement.</p>

<p>This move comes amid a growing curiosity about UFOs and government transparency. Trump stated that he will order Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth and other agencies to disclose the information, calling it “extremely interesting and important.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, date not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li><strong>Key figures:</strong> President Donald Trump, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday, President Trump announced his intention to direct federal agencies to release UFO-related files. Earlier that day, he criticized former President Barack Obama for allegedly disclosing classified information regarding aliens during a podcast interview. Obama had stated he believed in the statistical probability of extraterrestrial life but had seen no evidence of contact with Earth during his presidency.</p>

<p>In a 2024 Pentagon report, officials confirmed that investigations since World War Two have found no proof of extraterrestrial technology, attributing most sightings to misidentified ordinary objects or natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He took it out of classified information … He’s not supposed to be doing that,” Trump told reporters while traveling to Georgia, referring to Obama’s remarks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I don’t know if they’re real or not,” Trump added, regarding his own views on the existence of aliens.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Obama stated, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in Area 51.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around UFOs and government transparency has intensified in recent years, particularly following Pentagon investigations into UFO sightings. A 2024 report indicated that the US government has not found evidence of alien visitation. The National Archives has been noted for holding various records pertaining to UFOs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Federal agencies are expected to begin releasing the requested UFO records, although specific timelines for this process have not been disclosed.</p>
