      <h2>Neither deny nor confirm: CIA issues rare response to records request on 3I/ATLAS origin</h2>

<p>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has issued a rare response to a records request concerning the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, according to a blog post by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The CIA stated it could “neither deny nor confirm the existence or nonexistence of records” related to the object, which was first detected in July 2022.</p>

<p>This response has drawn attention as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our Solar System. The object has been subject to intense scrutiny due to its unusual characteristics and the public interest surrounding its potential origins, with some speculating it may be linked to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> July 2022</li>
    <li><strong>Response Date:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Requestor:</strong> John Greenewald Jr., UFO researcher</li>
    <li><strong>Agency Responding:</strong> Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Claim:</strong> Avi Loeb argues a 30–40% chance that 3I/ATLAS is not natural</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2022. Following its discovery, it exhibited unusual behaviour, including colour changes and variations in speed. The object was noted for its tail and anti-tail, as well as a 16.16-hour cycle of brightness.</p>
<p>In November 2025, NASA confirmed at a press conference that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, stating it poses no threat to Earth. The CIA's response to Greenewald's records request followed this confirmation, with their reply being a Glomar response.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The fact of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself currently and properly classified.” 
    — CIA response
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This is a wise policy for mitigating societal unrest or instability of financial markets at a time when the reality of a black swan event is still regarded as highly unlikely.” 
    — Avi Loeb
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have led to various theories and discussions among scientists and the public. Avi Loeb has been a prominent voice in suggesting that not all possibilities should be dismissed, arguing that some features of the object may indicate it is of technological origin. This perspective contrasts sharply with NASA’s assertion that it is a natural comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the nature of 3I/ATLAS are ongoing, but there is currently no indication of further disclosures from the CIA. The public and scientific community await any new findings or clarifications regarding the object’s origins.</p>
