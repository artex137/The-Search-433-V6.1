      <h2>Manhattan-sized interstellar object 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars as space agencies rush to make observations</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, measuring the size of Manhattan, is set to make its closest approach to Mars this week, with its nearest point occurring on Friday, October 3. The object will come within 18.5 million miles of the Red Planet, according to the European Space Agency (ESA). No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this event.</p>

<p>This close pass is significant for scientists, who are coordinating multiple space agencies to observe the phenomenon. The ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, along with NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, will all participate in the observation efforts using advanced imaging technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> Friday, October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 18.5 million miles (approximately 29.8 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Observation agencies:</strong> European Space Agency (ESA), NASA</li>
    <li><strong>Imaging technology:</strong> HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated diameter:</strong> More than 5 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated mass:</strong> 33 billion tons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. The highest resolution images to date were captured by the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025, when the object was 570 million kilometers away.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, the ESA and NASA have coordinated their observation schedules to capture detailed images of the object. Following its close pass to Mars, 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, after which it will no longer be visible from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The brightest pixel in the HiRISE image would gauge the surface area of 3I/ATLAS and therefore its diameter,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. “In a recent paper, I derived that the diameter of 3I/ATLAS is larger than 5 kilometers, larger than the width of Manhattan Island.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Loeb also noted, “Why is the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS a million times more mass than the first one? The image of HiRISE might exacerbate or weaken the discrepancy. Time will tell.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to have been observed. Its size is significantly larger than previous objects, such as Oumuamua, which was the size of a football field, and Borisov, which had a diameter of just 0.04 kilometers. The increased mass and size of 3I/ATLAS have raised questions about its origin and composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its pass by Mars, the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will begin observations as 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter between November 2 and 25, 2025. Further analysis and imaging will continue as scientists gather data on this unique interstellar object.</p>
