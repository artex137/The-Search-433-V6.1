      <h2>3I/ATLAS Will Reach Its Closest Point to Earth in 10 Days</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet designated as 3I/ATLAS will reach its nearest point to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet, which is the third confirmed object from beyond our solar system, is approximately 278 million kilometers away as of December 9, 2025, and poses no risk to Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers as it presents a unique opportunity to study a relic from another stellar system, estimated to be between 7 and 14 billion years old. Authorities, including various observatories and space agencies, are preparing to observe the comet's approach and behavior during this time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 278 million kilometers (as of December 9, 2025)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 1.798 AU (approximately 270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 60.3 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Apparent magnitude:</strong> 10.9, observable with moderate telescopes</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Estimated to be 7-14 billion years old</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Initial observations indicated a highly eccentric orbit, leading to its classification as an interstellar comet.</p>

<p>Follow-up observations on July 2, 2025, confirmed cometary activity, including a faint coma and tail. The Minor Planet Center subsequently assigned it the temporary designation A11pl3Z and later C/2025 N1.</p>

<p>On October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, achieving a maximum speed of 68.3 kilometers per second. It has since passed Mars, Mercury, and Venus, with the upcoming approach to Earth set for December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As an interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS offers a rare window into the chemistry and formation processes of exoplanetary systems,” said a spokesperson from the Minor Planet Center.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed after 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic trajectory suggests it is unbound to our solar system, making its study essential for understanding the origins of celestial bodies.</p>

<p>Previous observations of 3I/ATLAS have revealed it is rich in carbon dioxide, with a unique composition that distinguishes it from typical solar system comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Upcoming observations, including scheduled imaging by the James Webb Space Telescope in December 2025, will further explore the comet's characteristics and post-perihelion evolution.</p>
