      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: South African MeerKAT Telescope Unveils Truth Behind Radio Signals</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which entered the solar system on July 1, 2025, has been confirmed as a natural phenomenon rather than an alien technology, according to researchers using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. The telescope detected signals from the comet as it made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for the scientific community, as it enhances understanding of the composition and behavior of comets. Researchers from the University of Cape Town, SARAO, and Sweden's KTH Royal Institute of Technology have led the investigation, which has provided insights into the distribution of water in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025, in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>It approached Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, approximately 1.4 astronomical units (AU) from the sun.</li>
    <li>MeerKAT detected hydroxyl absorption signals from the comet on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Breakthrough Listen project found no technosignatures from 3I/ATLAS on November 5, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile. The comet exhibited unusual movement and speed, prompting further investigation. Between September and November 2025, the MeerKAT telescope searched for signals associated with the comet.</p>

<p>After initial unsuccessful attempts, the telescope successfully detected hydroxyl absorption on October 24, 2025, as the comet approached its perihelion on October 29, 2025. Following this, additional signals were detected in early November, transitioning from absorption to emission.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Detecting the hydroxyl signal is an important confirmation that 3I/ATLAS is behaving like a comet,” said Professor Mykola Ivchenko from KTH Sweden.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are proud to contribute to the understanding of this remarkable natural phenomenon,” stated SARAO chief scientist Fernando Camilo.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery follows the detection of two previous interstellar visitors, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which raised questions about extraterrestrial life. The findings from 3I/ATLAS highlight the need for continued research into the origins and behavior of celestial objects.</p>

<p>The lack of detected technosignatures has led the scientific community to reaffirm the importance of natural explanations for such phenomena, despite ongoing interest in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey back into the interstellar void, researchers will further analyze the data collected to enhance understanding of water distribution in the galaxy. Future studies may focus on other interstellar objects to gain additional insights into their properties and origins.</p>
