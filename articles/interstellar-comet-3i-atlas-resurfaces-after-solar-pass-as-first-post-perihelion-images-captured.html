      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS resurfaces after solar pass as first post-perihelion images captured</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has returned to view from Earth following its passage behind the sun, with the first optical images captured on Friday, 31 October, 2025, at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the first observations of 3I/ATLAS after it reached perihelion on 29 October. Authorities, including astronomers and researchers, are now preparing for a productive observing period to gather more data on the comet's composition and behavior as it recedes from the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion at approximately 1.4 astronomical units (about 130 million miles or 210 million kilometers) on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>The initial image was taken using a 6-inch telescope.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to become more visible as it moves further from the sun.</li>
    <li>Observations have been conducted using both large telescopes and amateur equipment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been tracked since its discovery in July 2023. It reached perihelion on 29 October 2025, after which it briefly slipped from optical view. The first post-perihelion image was captured on 31 October, with reports of visibility improvements expected as the comet continues its trajectory.</p>

<p>Researchers and amateur astronomers relied on space-based observations during the blackout period around perihelion. A study by Qicheng Zhang and a colleague was posted to the arXiv preprint server on 28 October, detailing the comet's rapid brightening and distinct hue ahead of perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Discovery Telescope is among the few large instruments able to point sufficiently low to the east to acquire 3I/ATLAS so soon after perihelion,” said Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at Lowell Observatory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“As the object draws further from the sun, its solar elongation should expand to around 25–30 degrees within a week, opening opportunities for major observatories worldwide to commence systematic follow-up,” Zhang added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object, and previous studies have indicated that it may be around 3 billion years older than our solar system. Researchers have noted that intense space-weathering might have produced a thick irradiated crust on the comet, obscuring its original signatures.</p>

<p>Despite some speculative claims, astronomers broadly regard 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet from elsewhere in the Milky Way, and its study offers insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues to recede from the sun, researchers expect to gather more data on its composition and behavior. Major observatories worldwide are preparing for systematic follow-up observations, while amateur astronomers are encouraged to seek clear skies for potential views of the comet.</p>
