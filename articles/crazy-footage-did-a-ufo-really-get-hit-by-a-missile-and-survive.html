      <h2>Video of UFO Surviving Missile Strike Sparks Debate</h2>

<p>A video shared by Congress on September 10, 2025, has shown a UFO allegedly taking a direct hit from a U.S. missile and surviving. The incident reportedly occurred off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The footage was presented at a whistleblower hearing and has generated significant interest and speculation regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life. Authorities and experts are examining the video to determine its authenticity and implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Date video shared: September 10, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Type of missile: U.S. "Hellfire" missile</li>
    <li>Altitude of UFO: Over 10,000 feet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a UFO was reportedly struck by a U.S. missile while flying at an altitude of over 10,000 feet off the coast of Yemen. The video of this incident was not made public until September 10, 2025, when it was shown during a congressional whistleblower hearing.</p>

<p>After the video was released, public reactions varied, with some speculating it as evidence of alien life. Skeptics, including Mick West, have raised questions about the video's authenticity and the nature of the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This footage raises important questions about what we are seeing in our skies," said an unnamed congressional member during the hearing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "I don't think it survived unscathed," said Mick West, a noted skeptic. "You can see debris from the impact, and the UFO's speed likely fell to near zero after the missile strike."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous incidents involving unidentified aerial phenomena have led to increased scrutiny from the government and the public. The U.S. military and various agencies have been tasked with investigating reports of UFO sightings, contributing to ongoing discussions about national security and extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
