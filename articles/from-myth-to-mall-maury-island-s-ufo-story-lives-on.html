      <h2>From myth to mall: Maury Island’s UFO story lives on</h2>

<p>Steve Edmiston has opened a new interactive exhibit about the Maury Island UFO incident at Westfield Southcenter Mall in Tukwila, Washington, which invites visitors to explore the story that first emerged in 1947. The exhibit, titled the UFO Pop-up Experience, opened in May and is expected to remain on display indefinitely.</p>

<p>This exhibit highlights the significance of the Maury Island incident in UFO lore and aims to engage the public in a local historical narrative that has been largely overshadowed by other events. Edmiston, who previously created a film about the incident, collaborates with the Maury Island Incident Historical Society and the regional tourism bureau Explore Seattle Southside to bring this piece of folklore to life through various interactive displays.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Exhibit opened: May 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Westfield Southcenter Mall, Tukwila, Washington</li>
    <li>Creator: Steve Edmiston</li>
    <li>Collaborators: Explore Seattle Southside, Maury Island Incident Historical Society</li>
    <li>Messages recorded for aliens: 10,000 (as of now)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Maury Island incident began on June 21, 1947, when Tacoma Harbor Patrolman Harold Dahl reported seeing six flying discs over Maury Island. According to Dahl, one of the discs dropped molten debris, injuring his son and killing their dog. The following day, a mysterious man visited Dahl, warning him to remain silent about the incident.</p>
<p>The story gained traction when Dahl’s business partner, Fred Crisman, shared it with a magazine editor, leading to broader media coverage and subsequent investigations by the Army Air Corps. Shortly after, a B-25 bomber carrying samples from the incident crashed, killing both pilots, which further drew attention to the case.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To me, that means Maury Island should be treated like any other case — investigate it,” said Edmiston, reflecting on the mixed narratives surrounding the incident.</blockquote>
<blockquote>James Clarkson, a retired police investigator, stated, “It relies on Dahl’s unverified account, later amplified by Crisman, whose credibility was questioned by the FBI.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Maury Island incident has often been overshadowed by the Roswell incident, which occurred shortly after and has become a cornerstone of UFO mythology in the United States. While the official narrative has labeled the Maury Island case a hoax, Edmiston’s exhibit seeks to challenge that perception and encourage public engagement with the historical context of the incident.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Edmiston plans to continue the exhibit’s run at the mall, hoping to attract more visitors and stimulate interest in the Maury Island story and its implications for folklore and collective memory.</p>
