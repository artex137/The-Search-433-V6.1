      <h2>UFO mania grips small town after mysterious glowing object sighting goes viral</h2>

<p>A glowing, pill-shaped object hovering over upstate New York has sparked UFO speculation after residents captured photos of the phenomenon near the Finger Lakes on August 12. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the sighting.</p>

<p>The incident has generated significant interest within the local community and beyond, prompting discussions in social media groups. Authorities have since clarified that the object was not an extraterrestrial craft but rather the planned launch of a Vulcan Centaur rocket by the United Launch Alliance from Cape Canaveral, Florida.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: August 12</li>
    <li>Location: Finger Lakes, New York</li>
    <li>Object identified as: Vulcan Centaur rocket launch</li>
    <li>Launch site: Cape Canaveral, Florida</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities reported</li>
    <li>Reported UFO sightings across state: Over 60 in the first half of 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 12, residents near the Finger Lakes reported seeing a slow-moving orb shrouded in a glowing mist. Photos of the object circulated widely on social media, leading to various theories and speculation about its origin.</p>

<p>Following the sighting, experts quickly identified the object as the Vulcan Centaur rocket launch. The United Launch Alliance was scheduled to launch the rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, confirming the sighting as a human-made aerospace event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“My first instinct from my scientific and military training is to look for a conventional explanation, such as a meteorological or human-made aerospace explanation, because that's what many objects in the sky are,” said retired Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet, Ph.D., U.S. Navy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In this case, it was both,” he added, emphasizing the importance of data verification when distinguishing between civilian misidentifications and genuinely Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP).</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UAP sightings have been on the rise, with over 60 reported across New York state in the first half of 2025, according to a national tracking group. Gallaudet noted that increased scientific transparency and investigation could help reduce stigma and fear associated with such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any further investigations into the recent sighting. However, experts continue to advocate for more research into UAPs to enhance understanding and public perception of these occurrences.</p>
