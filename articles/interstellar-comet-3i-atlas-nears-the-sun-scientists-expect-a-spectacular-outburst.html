      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I ATLAS Nears the Sun: Scientists Expect a Spectacular Outburst</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I ATLAS is approaching its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, set for October 29, 2025. The comet, which was captured in a new image by the Gemini South Telescope in Chile, is already showing signs of increased activity as sunlight warms its icy surface.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers, as 3I ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Each encounter provides a unique opportunity to study materials that formed around other stars, contributing to our understanding of planetary systems. Authorities from NASA and international observatories are preparing to monitor the comet closely as it nears the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: 130 million miles (210 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Image capture date: August 27, 2025</li>
    <li>Active monitoring by NASA, NOIRLab, AURA, and the International Gemini Observatory</li>
    <li>Expected visibility in early November 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 27, 2025, astronomers captured a stunning image of 3I ATLAS as it moved toward Mars's orbit. As the comet approaches the Sun, the heat causes gases like carbon monoxide and water ice to vaporize, creating a coma and a tail. This activity is anticipated to increase as the comet reaches perihelion on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>Following perihelion, 3I ATLAS will continue its journey past Mars's orbit and will exit the solar system. By early 2026, it is expected to fade from view beyond the capabilities of most telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Studying 3I/ATLAS with the full range of humanity’s astronomical instruments could yield untold secrets about the outer reaches of our galaxy,” said Brandon Specktor, editor at Live Science.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS is significant as it provides insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Previous encounters with interstellar comets have allowed scientists to gather valuable data about the formation of comets in other star systems. This current observation may reveal further details about its unique isotopic ratios and structural stability.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>A coordinated effort across multiple observatories will continue to monitor 3I ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Scientists aim to gather data on its chemical composition and activity levels before it exits the solar system permanently.</p>
