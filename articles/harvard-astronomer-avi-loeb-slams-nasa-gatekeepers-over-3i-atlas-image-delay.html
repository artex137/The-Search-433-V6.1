      <h2>Harvard Astronomer Avi Loeb Slams NASA 'Gatekeepers' Over 3I/ATLAS Image Delay</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomer <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has criticized NASA for delaying the release of HiRISE images of the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> due to a recent 43-day government shutdown. The images are expected to be released within days, as of November 14, 2025, after a prolonged wait that has frustrated the astronomical community.</p>

<p>The anticipated release of the HiRISE images is significant for scientists seeking to understand the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its unusual anti-tail feature. NASA's delay has drawn criticism from experts who argue that time-sensitive scientific data should take precedence over bureaucratic procedures.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA is expected to release HiRISE images of 3I/ATLAS shortly.</li>
    <li>The release follows a 43-day government shutdown.</li>
    <li>The last high-resolution observation of 3I/ATLAS was on July 21, 2025, by the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>The HiRISE images are expected to have a spatial resolution of approximately 30 kilometres per pixel.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed within 29 million kilometres of Mars on October 2-3, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of 3I/ATLAS, revealing its anti-tail feature. The object passed near Mars on October 2-3, 2025. Following a 43-day government shutdown, NASA's release of the HiRISE images is now imminent, with expectations set for the coming days as of November 14, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This bureaucratic paralysis is precisely what I refer to as 'gatekeeping'—prioritising protocol over time-sensitive, crucial scientific discovery,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The truth about the nature of 3I/ATLAS will be revealed by publicly shared data and not by any storyline of gatekeepers,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The delay in releasing the HiRISE images has reignited discussions about the importance of timely access to scientific data. Loeb's comments reflect a growing concern within the scientific community regarding the impact of bureaucracy on research and discovery.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The astronomical community awaits the release of the HiRISE images, which are expected to provide critical insights into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. Scientists are hopeful that this release will prompt a reevaluation of how time-sensitive data is managed within NASA and other scientific agencies.</p>
