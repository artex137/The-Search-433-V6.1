      <h2>3I/ATLAS tracker: Hubble observes interstellar comet again, captures 40,000 km glowing halo around coma</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS again, capturing images of a glowing halo around the comet's coma from a distance of 286 million kilometres on November 30. This marks the third observation of 3I/ATLAS, which recently made its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insight into the comet's characteristics and its trajectory. The European Space Agency has also released images of 3I/ATLAS, showcasing its activity after passing near the Sun. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has theorized about the comet's structure and behaviour, contributing to ongoing discussions in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 30</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 286 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Halo radius: approximately 40,000 kilometres</li>
    <li>Anti-tail extension: about 60,000 kilometres</li>
    <li>Comet speed: 60 km/s at closest approach</li>
    <li>Closest point to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated age of comet: 7-14 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar visitor to our solar system, was discovered in July. It exhibited a visible anti-tail shortly after its discovery. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun recently, after which Hubble observed it on November 30. The European Space Agency’s Juice probe has also captured images of the comet, indicating its activity post-encounter with the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The new radius of the glow is about 40,000 kilometres, and its anti-tail extension goes out to about 60,000 kilometres." He added that the swarm of macroscopic non-volatile objects is a result of non-gravitational acceleration away from the Sun.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third known comet from outside the solar system. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicates it is travelling from beyond the solar system. Previous observations have suggested that it could release smaller objects as it approaches Jupiter, which could be captured by the planet's gravity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, and will be visible to stargazers using binoculars or telescopes.</p>
