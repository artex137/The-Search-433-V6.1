      <h2>U.S. Congress Holds UFO Hearing Today</h2>
<p>The U.S. Congress is holding a hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) at 10 a.m. ET on Tuesday, September 9, 2023. The hearing, titled "Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection," is being conducted by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it seeks to address transparency regarding UAPs, with Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) leading the discussion. The hearing aims to provide answers to the public about UAPs and other government secrets, following a series of previous hearings that have not produced substantial evidence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> UAP hearing titled "Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection"</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, September 9, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Time:</strong> 10 a.m. ET (2 p.m. UTC)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> U.S. Congress</li>
    <li><strong>Chair:</strong> Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.)</li>
    <li><strong>Previous UAP sightings:</strong> 510 documented since 2004</li>
    <li><strong>Known sources:</strong> 339 sightings identified; 171 remain uncharacterized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In January 2023, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform established the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets. This task force has focused on UAPs, among other topics.</p>
<p>Previous hearings have taken place over the last few years but have not provided significant evidence regarding UAPs. The current hearing aims to change that dynamic.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The federal government has been hiding information from Americans for decades... It is time to give Americans the answers they deserve, which is why I am honored to lead this bipartisan task force that seeks truth and transparency,” said Representative Anna Paulina Luna.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Rep. [Anna Paulina] Luna just told me, if I say 'Immaculate Constellation' I'll be on some list, maybe a FISA warrant,” said then-Chair Nancy Mace in a previous hearing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous UAP hearings have not yielded dramatic evidence, and the current task force aims to bolster transparency. In March 2024, a Pentagon report stated there was “no evidence” confirming that any UAP sightings represented extraterrestrial technology. The report also denied any governmental cover-up of alien encounters.</p>
<p>The federal government has documented 510 UAP sightings since 2004, with 339 identified as known sources, leaving 171 classified as “uncharacterized and unattributed.”</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The hearing will continue to explore UAPs and related government secrets, with the aim of increasing transparency and public trust. Further investigations and discussions are expected to follow based on the outcomes of today's hearing.</p>
