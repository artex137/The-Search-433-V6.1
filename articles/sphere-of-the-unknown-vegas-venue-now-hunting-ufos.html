      <h2>SPHERE OF THE UNKNOWN: Vegas Venue Now Hunting UFOs</h2>

<p>The Galileo Observatory has begun tracking unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) from the top of the Sphere in Las Vegas, which also hosts screenings of "The Wizard of Oz." The project launched in late August 2024, coinciding with the film's debut at the venue. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This initiative matters as it represents a significant technological advancement in the search for extraterrestrial life. The observatory uses cutting-edge equipment to monitor the night sky for objects that should not be moving, according to its designer, Harvard professor Avi Loeb. Sphere Entertainment CEO James Dolan approved the installation, which aims to analyze millions of objects annually.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Galileo Observatory is located atop the Sphere in Las Vegas.</li>
    <li>The project began in late August 2024, coinciding with "The Wizard of Oz" screenings.</li>
    <li>It utilizes ultra-high-resolution optical and infrared cameras.</li>
    <li>Two additional observatories are installed 10 kilometers away, forming a triangle.</li>
    <li>Loeb estimates the observatory will analyze data on millions of objects each year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 2024, Sphere Entertainment CEO James Dolan visited Avi Loeb's home in Boston to approve the installation of the Galileo Observatory. The observatory began its operations at the same time "The Wizard of Oz" started screening at the Sphere in late August.</p>

<p>The observatory employs artificial intelligence to filter data and eliminate human bias, allowing for a more accurate assessment of aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We hope to analyze exquisite data on a few million objects per year in search of UAPs over Las Vegas,” Loeb wrote on his Medium page.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Here’s hoping that the Galileo Project Observatory on Sphere will spot an extraterrestrial guest of higher intelligence than displayed in terrestrial academia,” Loeb added, referencing the skepticism he has faced from peers.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Galileo Observatory is part of a broader movement to investigate UAPs, a topic that has garnered increased attention in recent years. Loeb is recognized as a leading figure in the scientific community advocating for the exploration of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Historically, discussions surrounding UFOs have often faced skepticism, with many in academia dismissing such inquiries as pseudoscience.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Galileo Observatory will continue to operate, aiming to gather data on UAPs over Las Vegas. Investigations into the collected data will proceed, with no specific deadlines disclosed for findings or reports. </p>
