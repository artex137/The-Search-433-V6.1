      <h2>As interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, cosmic visitor found carrying key molecule linked to life</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is gaining attention as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach set for December 19, 2023, when it will be approximately 170 million miles away. Scientists have discovered that the comet is emitting high levels of methanol, a molecule essential to early prebiotic chemistry, which has not been detected in any previous interstellar object.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for researchers studying the origins of life. The findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the chemical processes that occur in interstellar environments. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center research team, led by Martin Cordiner, has utilized the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to analyze the comet's chemistry in detail.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in late June 2023.</li>
    <li>Confirmed as the third known interstellar object in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Travels through the inner solar system at approximately 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet emits between 250 and 500 grams of hydrogen cyanide per second.</li>
    <li>Methanol production reaches nearly 40 kilograms per second, making up about 8% of released vapour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in late June 2023. It was confirmed as an interstellar object in July, marking it as the third of its kind. The comet has been observed racing through the inner solar system, with significant findings regarding its chemical composition reported in November 2023.</p>
<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured a new image of the comet on November 30, confirming its continued activity after passing near the Sun in October.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Hydrogen cyanide and methanol usually appear only in small traces in our own comets. But in this interstellar object, they seem to be unusually abundant,” said Martin Cordiner of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s very unlikely you can reach high chemical complexity without producing methanol along the way,” Cordiner added, emphasizing the importance of methanol in the context of chemical reactions linked to the origins of life.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of methanol in 3I/ATLAS is notable as most comets in our solar system emit only around 2% methanol. This finding suggests a complex chemical environment within the comet, offering rare insights into the formation of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further observations may refine understanding of the comet's composition and its implications for the origins of life in the universe.</p>
