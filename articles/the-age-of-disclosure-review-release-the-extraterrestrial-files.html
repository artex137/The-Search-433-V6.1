      <h2>‘The Age of Disclosure’ Review: Release the Extraterrestrial Files</h2>

<p>The documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> has premiered on November 20, 2025, presenting claims by former U.S. government officials regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (U.A.P.), previously known as UFOs. The film features insights from Luis Elizondo, who led the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program until 2017.</p>

<p>This documentary is significant as it calls for the U.S. government to reveal what it knows about U.A.P. Elizondo and other contributors argue that excessive secrecy has hindered public understanding of the phenomena. The film aims to shed light on the alleged cover-ups and the need for transparency in government dealings with U.A.P.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, Luis Elizondo resigns from the Pentagon in protest of secrecy surrounding U.A.P. investigations. He later authors a memoir and appears before Congress to advocate for transparency. The documentary, featuring Elizondo and others, is released on November 20, 2025, aiming to inform the public about government knowledge of U.A.P.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>

<h2>Context</h2>

This documentary is part of a broader movement urging governments to disclose information about U.A.P. and address public concerns regarding national security and transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
