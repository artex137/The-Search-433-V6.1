      <h2>NASA Responds To Claims That Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Is An Advanced Alien Spacecraft</h2>

<p>NASA has responded to claims that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a spacecraft sent by an advanced alien civilization. The claims were popularized by Harvard professor Avi Loeb shortly after astronomers spotted the object on July 1, 2025, moving through the Solar System at nearly twice the speed of previous interstellar visitors. The object, confirmed to be an interstellar comet, has an estimated nucleus size of around 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles).</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential origins and characteristics, which may provide insights into the early universe. NASA has stated that while the object is of great interest to scientists, it is not a threat to Earth. The agency emphasizes that the object exhibits typical cometary behavior, contradicting claims of it being an alien probe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered on: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Nucleus size: approximately 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles)</li>
    <li>Speed: nearly twice that of previous interstellar objects</li>
    <li>Not a threat to Earth, according to NASA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS moving through the Solar System. Shortly after its discovery, Avi Loeb suggested that the object may be an advanced spacecraft potentially sent to destroy Earth. Loeb's claims were based on a theoretical framework he described in his blog. NASA has since conducted observations and confirmed that the object behaves like a typical comet.</p>

<p>NASA's lead scientist for Solar System small bodies, Tom Statler, stated that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, not an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for Solar System small bodies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Given the observations that have taken place already, the object is not a threat to the Earth, and is not secretly harboring alien technology to destroy us all,” NASA stated in their response.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time claims about extraterrestrial origins of interstellar objects have surfaced. Avi Loeb has previously speculated about objects such as 'Oumuamua, suggesting it might be a light sail. Despite the sensational nature of these theories, scientific consensus has consistently categorized these objects as natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Observations will help further confirm its characteristics and behavior as a comet.</p>
