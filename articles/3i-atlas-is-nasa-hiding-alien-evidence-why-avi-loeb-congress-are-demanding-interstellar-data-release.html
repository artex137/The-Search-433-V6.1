      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Is NASA Hiding Alien Evidence? Why Avi Loeb, Congress Are Demanding Interstellar Data Release</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, a comet of interstellar origin, has drawn significant attention since it was first spotted on 1 July 2025. The object is currently traveling through our Solar System and is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed. Observations have sparked speculation about its nature, with some suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>The scientific community and the public are urging the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to release all available data on 3I/ATLAS. Researchers believe that transparency is crucial for understanding this unique object. A formal request for data has been made by Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who are demanding access to images captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) before a critical viewing window closes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS first spotted on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Current distance from Mars: approximately 30 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Significant image captured on 2 October 2025 by the HiRISE camera on the MRO.</li>
    <li>Image resolution: 30 kilometers per pixel.</li>
    <li>NASA attributed data release delays to an early-October government shutdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025. On 2 October 2025, the HiRISE camera aboard the MRO captured a significant image of the comet. Calls for data transparency have intensified since then, culminating in a formal request for the release of these images.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The images are extremely valuable scientifically because they possess a spatial resolution of 30 kilometers per pixel,” Loeb said in a Medium post. “About 3 times better than the spatial resolution achieved in the best publicly available image from the Hubble Space Telescope, taken on 21 July 2025.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb added, “The scientific community would have greatly benefited from the dissemination of this time-sensitive data as astronomers plan follow-up observations in the coming months.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>When asked about the alien theory, Loeb remarked, “I suggested that the delay is probably not a sign of extraterrestrial intelligence but rather of terrestrial stupidity.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The sighting of 3I/ATLAS has fueled scientific interest and speculation about its origin and nature. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have also prompted discussions about potential extraterrestrial life. Calls for data transparency have become more frequent as the scientific community emphasizes the importance of open access to information.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The formal request for data has been sent to NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy. Researchers and officials await a response regarding the release of the images, which are considered essential for further studies of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
