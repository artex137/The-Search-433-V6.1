      <h2>This interstellar comet could be one of the oldest objects in the entire galaxy</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object discovered in July, is currently passing through our solar system and has generated significant interest among scientists. The comet was first spotted 420 million miles from Earth by a planetary defense facility designed to detect potentially hazardous asteroids.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is important as it represents only the third known interstellar object identified. Its unique characteristics and trajectory suggest it may be one of the oldest objects in the galaxy, possibly originating from a cluster of stars that formed around eight billion years ago. Researchers are conducting ongoing observations to learn more about its composition and behavior as it approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2023, 420 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>Current speed: approximately 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Size estimates for the nucleus: between 450 meters and 1.1 kilometers long.</li>
    <li>Discovered by a planetary defense facility.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted using the Gemini South telescope, NASA's SPHEREx observatory, and the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>Notable observations include high levels of carbon dioxide and nickel in the coma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, scientists identified 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar object. Following its discovery, the comet began its approach towards the inner solar system. By late August, astronomers utilized the Gemini South telescope in Chile to analyze its coma and tail, revealing significant details about its chemical composition.</p>

<p>Further observations from space-based telescopes, including NASA's SPHEREx and the James Webb Space Telescope, indicated unusual emissions of carbon dioxide. The Very Large Telescope in Chile also detected nickel in the comet's coma, raising questions about the nature of its composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It could be one of the oldest objects in the galaxy,” says Martin Cordiner, an astrochemist at The Catholic University of America.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The [carbon dioxide] flux is just incredibly high,” says Cristina Thomas, a planetary astronomer at Northern Arizona University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a small group of interstellar objects, with only two others previously identified. These comets provide insights into the early conditions of the universe and the processes that formed planetary systems. The presence of metals such as nickel and iron in 3I/ATLAS is particularly intriguing, as these elements are typically associated with supernova events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, aiming to gather more data on its composition and behavior. Ongoing observations may help clarify the unusual characteristics observed thus far and contribute to our understanding of ancient celestial bodies.</p>
