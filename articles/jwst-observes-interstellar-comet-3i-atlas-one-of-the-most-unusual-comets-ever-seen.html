      <h2>JWST Observes Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: “One Of The Most Unusual Comets Ever Seen”</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the fastest interstellar comet recorded, has been observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), revealing its unique characteristics. The brief observation occurred when the comet was 3.32 times farther from the Sun than Earth, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it highlights the comet's unusual outgassing of carbon dioxide, ranking it as the second most CO2-rich comet ever observed. Researchers aim to further understand its composition and origins through ongoing studies. Lead author Dr. Martin Cordiner emphasized the importance of the findings, stating that the data obtained from JWST is remarkable given the short observation time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the fastest interstellar comet observed to date.</li>
    <li>It was observed by JWST from a distance of 3.32 times the Earth-Sun distance.</li>
    <li>The comet is the second most CO2-rich comet ever recorded, after R2/PAnSTARRS.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to the Sun at 210 million kilometers on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The study has been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The observation of Comet 3I/ATLAS took place during a brief 10-minute window using JWST's infrared capabilities. Researchers confirmed the comet's outgassing of carbon dioxide and began comparisons with other known comets, including Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov.</p>
<p>The comet's trajectory will bring it within 210 million kilometers of the Sun on October 30, 2025. It will be visible from Earth until September, before disappearing behind the Sun, with plans for renewed visibility in December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We observed an interstellar space rock with JWST! The data are spectacular, and considering the short (10-minute) observing time, the amount of information we got is astounding,” said Dr. Martin Cordiner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is different compared to our usual comets. It is releasing so much CO2, it’s the second most CO2-rich comet ever seen, making it one of the most unusual comets ever seen,” Dr. Cordiner added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects, which includes Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, and Comet 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019. Its high carbon dioxide content suggests a different formation process compared to typical comets found in the Solar System.</p>
<p>Understanding the origins and composition of such comets may provide insights into the conditions that exist in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct more observations and theoretical studies to clarify the origins of the comet's carbon dioxide. Further data collection will help build a clearer picture of 3I/ATLAS and its unique characteristics.</p>
