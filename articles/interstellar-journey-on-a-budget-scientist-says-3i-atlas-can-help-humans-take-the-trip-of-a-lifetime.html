      <h2>Interstellar journey on a budget: Scientist says 3I/ATLAS can help humans take the trip of a lifetime</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has proposed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could provide humanity with unprecedented opportunities for interstellar travel. Loeb has suggested that intercepting the object, which is currently thought to be a comet, could grant access to advanced technology that would otherwise take years to develop. He shared these views in a recent blog post and radio interview.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the potential of 3I/ATLAS to revolutionize space travel. NASA and other space agencies are currently focused on lunar missions and Mars exploration, but Loeb argues that 3I/ATLAS could inspire humanity to reach beyond these boundaries. His claims also highlight the potential risks associated with the object, which he suggests could be an alien probe from an intelligent civilization.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently classified as a comet.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a scientist from Harvard University.</li>
    <li>The object is believed to be undertaking interstellar travel.</li>
    <li>Loeb claims that studying 3I/ATLAS could save billions and trillions of dollars in research costs.</li>
    <li>NASA is currently preparing for lunar missions under the Artemis program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has expressed his views about 3I/ATLAS in various platforms:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loeb published a blog post outlining the potential benefits of intercepting 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>He discussed the object in a radio interview, raising concerns about its nature.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Such a discovery may inspire us to reach interstellar space, well beyond our current travel plans for the Moon and Mars,” said Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS is a comet, then I would be relieved because in that case, humanity will not face any risk,” Loeb stated in a radio interview.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions surrounding interstellar objects have focused on the potential for extraterrestrial life. The discovery of 2I/Borisov, another interstellar comet, has fueled interest in the study of objects originating outside the solar system. Loeb's assertions about 3I/ATLAS add to the ongoing debate about the implications of such discoveries for humanity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further research and observation of 3I/ATLAS are necessary to determine its true nature and any potential risks it may pose. NASA and other agencies may consider these findings as they plan future missions related to interstellar exploration.</p>
