      <h2>NASA explains how interstellar object 3I/Atlas got its name</h2>

<p>A fast-moving interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, has captured global attention since its detection in July 2023. NASA's ATLAS observatory first spotted the object, which is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the object.</p>

<p>This naming of 3I/Atlas matters as it represents a new era in identifying interstellar visitors. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are actively monitoring the object's trajectory, which has sparked debate among astronomers regarding its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected: July 2023 by NASA's ATLAS observatory</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: No closer than 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Passed within 19 million miles of Mars: Early October 2023</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The object 3I/Atlas was first detected in July 2023. Following its detection, it sparked immediate debate among astronomers about its classification as either a comet or something more unusual. In early October, it passed within 19 million miles of Mars. The object is anticipated to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<p>As it travels through the inner Solar System, astronomers have begun a process called precovery, examining older images to trace its path. Observations have revealed unusual features, such as an “anti-tail,” where dust appears to point toward the sun instead of away from it.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/Atlas poses no threat to Earth,” NASA officials stated. “It will come no closer than 170 million miles.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Before the discovery of 3I/Atlas, only two other interstellar objects had been recorded: 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The naming convention for interstellar objects has been updated to reflect the increased number of detections by modern surveys, making traditional naming methods impractical.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA, along with independent researchers, will continue to track 3I/Atlas as it moves through the inner Solar System. Ongoing observations aim to clarify the object's true nature and origins.</p>
