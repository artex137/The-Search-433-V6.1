      <h2>Mystery Over Sarjapur Skies: Viral UFO Sightings Spark Investigation at SUYUG Infra Site</h2>

<p>On January 10, 2026, multiple reports of an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Sarjapur in Bengaluru have prompted an investigation by local authorities. Residents reported sightings early Friday morning, with no injuries or fatalities reported. The incident has created a significant buzz, particularly around a construction site operated by SUYUG Infra.</p>

<p>The sightings have raised concerns among locals, leading to a heavy police presence and the establishment of a restricted zone around the SUYUG Infra site. Authorities are conducting a joint technical assessment to determine the object’s origin and trajectory, as social media has been inundated with video recordings and eyewitness accounts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on January 9, 2026, between 1:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m.</li>
    <li>The object was reported as a "bright, slow-moving object."</li>
    <li>Footage was captured at 3:02 a.m. and released by SUYUG Infra.</li>

At 3:02 a.m., SUYUG Infra's security cameras captured footage of the object descending over the construction site.</p>

<p>Following the release of the video, the site was cordoned off to ensure the safety of personnel and facilitate investigations. The response from SUYUG Infra came shortly after the footage went viral, aiming to address public concerns and clarify the situation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
