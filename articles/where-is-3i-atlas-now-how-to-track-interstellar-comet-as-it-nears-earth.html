      <h2>Where is 3I/ATLAS now? How to track interstellar comet as it nears Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth and is set to pass within about 170 million miles of the planet on December 19, 2025. Discovered in July 2025, this comet has garnered significant attention from scientists and the public alike due to its unique origin and trajectory.</p>

<p>The proximity of 3I/ATLAS offers a rare opportunity for scientists to study a comet that has traveled from another star system. NASA has released detailed images and data from its observations, and the comet is expected to be visible through telescopes in the pre-dawn sky until spring 2026. Though not visible to the naked eye, those with small telescopes can see it near the star Regulus in the constellation Leo during its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass within about 170 million miles of Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was discovered in July 2025 and is the third known object from outside the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at approximately 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Its size is estimated to be between 1,400 feet and 3.5 miles wide.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured images of the comet, with the latest sighting on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is not a threat to Earth and is not visible to the naked eye.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025, moving rapidly through our solar system. It has since passed within the orbit of Mars and has come within 130 million miles of the sun. NASA has been tracking its trajectory and speed, confirming that it formed in another star system before being ejected into interstellar space.</p>

<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA released new images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing its characteristics. The comet's closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, when it will be observable in the pre-dawn sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy in a public exchange regarding the comet's nature.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” stated Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has sparked various theories about its nature, including claims that it could be an alien spaceship. These theories have been largely dismissed by scientists, who emphasize that the comet is of natural origin. The comet's trajectory and speed have been confirmed through extensive observations by NASA's fleet of telescopes, including the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its path and gather data. Observations from ground and space telescopes will help improve our understanding of interstellar objects and their significance in the study of the universe.</p>
