      <h2>Astronomers monitor comet 3I/ATLAS, under threat of solar disintegration as it approaches the sun</h2>

<p>Scientists have intensified surveillance of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, facing a significant risk of disintegration. The comet, discovered in 2023, is on a trajectory that will bring it to perihelion, its closest point to the sun, where extreme temperatures and gravitational forces could fragment it.</p>

<p>This monitoring is crucial for understanding the composition of other stellar systems. A global network of telescopes, including advanced terrestrial and space-based equipment, has been mobilized to document this rare celestial phenomenon. Observations have already shown an increase in gas and dust release, indicating that the comet's nucleus is heating up.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in 2023.</li>
    <li>Perihelion scheduled for 2026.</li>
    <li>Current speed: 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>Comet's trajectory confirmed as hyperbolic, indicating extrasolar origin.</li>
    <li>Global collaboration involving observatories in Hawaii, Chile, and the Canary Islands.</li>
    <li>Signs of instability include changes in brightness and shape of its coma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, astronomers first identified comet 3I/ATLAS using the telescopes of the ATLAS project. Throughout 2025, ongoing observations have indicated increasing signs of instability as it approaches the sun. The comet's perihelion, when it will be most vulnerable, is expected to occur in 2026.</p>

<p>Recent analyses have revealed surface fissures and jets of material being expelled from the comet's nucleus, suggesting an ongoing fragmentation process. As the comet draws closer to the sun, the rate of sublimation of its icy components has increased, raising concerns about its structural integrity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unique composition of 3I/ATLAS offers an unprecedented opportunity for scientists to study materials that formed in a stellar environment completely different from our own,” said a representative from the global astronomical community.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third officially recognized interstellar comet, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Such events are rare in our solar system, providing significant scientific value for understanding the cosmos. Previous observations of comets have contributed to our knowledge of planetary system formation and the diversity of cosmic environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its approach, scientists will maintain close monitoring to document any further changes. Advanced algorithms are being used to model potential fragmentation dynamics and predict the comet’s future behavior.</p>
