      <h2>The Racing Speed of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been recorded entering the solar system at a speed of approximately <strong>60 kilometers per second</strong>, making it about 600 times faster than the world’s fastest racing car. This high velocity suggests that it originated from the thick disk of old stars in the Milky Way galaxy, according to recent analyses by astronomer <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for understanding the origins and characteristics of interstellar objects. Researchers are examining the unique properties of 3I/ATLAS, which deviates from previous interstellar comets in terms of speed and composition. The findings could provide insights into the formation of stars and the dynamics of the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at <strong>60 kilometers per second</strong>.</li>
    <li>Its speed is about <strong>600 times faster</strong> than the fastest racing car.</li>
    <li>The comet may have originated from stars approximately <strong>10 billion years old</strong>.</li>
    <li>The diameter of 3I/ATLAS has been estimated to be as large as <strong>46 kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>The object exhibits a mass that is <strong>a million times greater</strong> than 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is primarily composed of <strong>95% carbon dioxide</strong> gas.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach perihelion on <strong>October 29, 2025</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent studies on 3I/ATLAS have revealed its high speed and unique characteristics. Initial observations indicated its rapid velocity, which researchers believe may be connected to its origins from ancient stars. Further spectroscopic analysis has provided insight into its composition, indicating a significant presence of carbon dioxide and a lack of water vapor.</p>

<p>As the expected perihelion date approaches, astronomers continue to study 3I/ATLAS to learn more about its trajectory and physical properties. The comet's unusual features have sparked interest in the scientific community, prompting ongoing research efforts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb commented on the anomalies of 3I/ATLAS, stating, “The combination of these anomalies lead me to assign a rank of 4 to 3I/ATLAS on the Loeb Scale where a rank of 10 flags a technological object that poses a threat to Earth.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as an outlier compared to previous interstellar objects, 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its high speed and retrograde velocity direction are rare, with a statistical chance of <strong>1 in 500</strong> for such an arrival direction. The comet's unique properties challenge existing theories about interstellar objects and their formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion in late 2025. Ongoing investigations will focus on its physical characteristics and any potential implications for Earth and the solar system.</p>
