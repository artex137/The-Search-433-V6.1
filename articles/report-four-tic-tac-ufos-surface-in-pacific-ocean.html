      <h2>Report: Four Tic-Tac UFOs Surface In Pacific Ocean</h2>

<p>A U.S. Navy officer has reported a confrontation with four unidentified flying objects shaped like tic-tacs that emerged from the Pacific Ocean on February 15, 2023. Senior Chief Operations Specialist Alexandro Wiggins, who has served in the Navy for 23 years, was aboard the USS Jackson during the incident. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it adds to ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena and military encounters. Authorities are reviewing the incident, with experts examining flight data to assess the implications of such sightings in military airspace.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> February 15, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Pacific Ocean, Warning Area 291</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 15, 2023, Senior Chief Operations Specialist Alexandro Wiggins and fellow sailors aboard the USS Jackson detected unusual objects on their monitors while operating in Warning Area 291. Wiggins stepped outside for a clearer view and observed a light on the horizon that appeared to emerge from the water. He then returned to the combat center to analyze the phenomenon with a thermal sensor, which revealed two tic-tac-shaped objects. Upon further examination, Wiggins noted a total of four objects moving in unison.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To my surprise, which is something I’ve never witnessed, was a light I noticed on the horizon, it looked as if it were surfacing out of the water and going up,” Wiggins recalled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It was only when we zoom out that we realize, holy crap, there’s two more out here, a total of four,” he added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“At some point, it’ll be public, but then I’ll be old,” Wiggins stated regarding the potential future disclosure of the incident.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident occurs in a region known for previous UFO sightings, including a notable encounter in 2004 involving Navy pilots who observed similar tic-tac-shaped objects. The area, designated as Warning Area 291, is under military jurisdiction and has been the subject of various investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating the incident, reviewing flight data and assessing any implications for military operations in the area. Further analysis may lead to public disclosures regarding the nature of these sightings in the future.</p>
