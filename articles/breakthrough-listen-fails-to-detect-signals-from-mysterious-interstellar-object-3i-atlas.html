      <h2>Breakthrough Listen Fails to Detect Signals from Mysterious Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Researchers from the Breakthrough Listen project have failed to detect any signals from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which approached Earth on December 19, 2023. The object was observed traveling through the solar system at an unusually high speed, and its closest approach to Earth was approximately 267 million kilometres away.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar entity detected near Earth. The lack of detected signals raises questions about the object's origins, which some scientists, including Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, have speculated could include the possibility of being an extraterrestrial artifact. According to reports, a team from the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) confirmed no artificial radio emissions were localized to the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 267 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Observing telescope: Green Bank Telescope</li>
    <li>Research team: Breakthrough Listen project and SETI</li>
    <li>Findings: No detection of candidate signals</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb's initial assessment: ranked 3I/ATLAS a four on his "Loeb scale"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, researchers using the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey telescope in Chile discovered 3I/ATLAS. The object was identified as a natural comet with a coma and an icy nucleus.</p>

<p>On December 18, 2023, the Breakthrough Listen team directed the Green Bank Telescope toward 3I/ATLAS to search for signals. The team reported no detected signals on December 19, the day of the object's closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS continues to behave as expected from natural astrophysical processes,” researchers concluded in their summary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The probabilities of 3I/ATLAS being an extraterrestrial probe appear to be diminishing,” Loeb stated, emphasizing the absence of detected communication during the object's close proximity.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of interstellar objects has gained interest in recent years, with 3I/ATLAS being the third such entity identified. The ongoing research into these objects is crucial for understanding their nature and potential origins, including the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS following its closest approach, with updates on Loeb's ranking of the object expected in several months as more data becomes available.</p>
