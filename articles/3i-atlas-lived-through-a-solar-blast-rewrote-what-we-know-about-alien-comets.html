      <h2>3I/ATLAS Lived Through a Solar Blast & Rewrote What We Know About Alien Comets</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has provided new insights into the composition of alien comets after successfully surviving a close solar flyby in October 2025. This event, which allowed scientists to study the comet in detail, has reshaped expectations surrounding interstellar objects.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances the understanding of cometary chemistry and the processes that govern planet formation in distant solar systems. Researchers have noted that the data collected before and after the comet’s perihelion offers a rare opportunity to study how solar radiation can alter the chemical composition of interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS survived a close flyby of the Sun in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Astronomers detected emissions of atomic nickel and iron before and after the flyby.</li>
    <li>Post-perihelion observations showed the presence of methanol, ethane, and dark dust.</li>
    <li>The comet's surface chemistry was altered due to solar heating.</li>
    <li>This event enables a new approach to studying the metallic makeup of distant planetary systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, 3I/ATLAS approached the Sun, an event expected to be harsh for the comet. Astronomers monitored emissions from the comet before and after its closest approach, known as perihelion. Following the flyby, the comet exhibited changes in its chemical composition, resembling that of solar system comets.</p>

<p>The continuous dataset collected during this period is unprecedented for an interstellar comet, providing valuable insights into the conditions of its origin and the effects of solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Having pre- and post-solar measurements allows researchers to quantify how stellar radiation modifies cometary material,” said a spokesperson for the research team.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS provides both the signal and the distortion; a rare combination that improves interpretation of future interstellar visitors,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are typically brief visitors that provide limited data before departing back into deep space. 3I/ATLAS has broken this trend by remaining observable for an extended period and offering a unique opportunity to study its chemical makeup. This finding contributes to the broader understanding of how planets form in various solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are expected to continue analyzing the data collected from 3I/ATLAS as they refine their understanding of interstellar comet chemistry and its implications for planetary formation beyond the solar system.</p>
