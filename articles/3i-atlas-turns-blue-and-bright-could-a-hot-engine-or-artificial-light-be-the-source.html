      <h2>3I/ATLAS turns blue and bright: Could a 'hot engine' or 'artificial light' be the source?</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed unexpected changes in brightness and colour during its recent perihelion near the Sun, leaving scientists intrigued. Observations have confirmed these alterations, with the comet showing a blue hue instead of the expected red. The phenomena were reported by astronomers and a comet hunter, including Worachate Boonplod, who spotted the comet using NOAA's GOES-19 weather satellite.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it challenges existing theories about comet behaviour near the Sun. Authorities, including NASA, are analyzing the data to understand the mechanisms behind these changes, which could suggest artificial influences or unique physical properties of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS displayed unexpected changes near the Sun.</li>
    <li>Radial acceleration measured at 135 kilometres per day squared.</li>
    <li>Transverse acceleration measured at 60 kilometres per day squared.</li>
    <li>Brightness reached a magnitude of approximately 9 at perihelion.</li>
    <li>Worachate Boonplod observed 3I/ATLAS on October 24, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet expected to reemerge in late November and December 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 24, 2023, amateur astronomer Worachate Boonplod detected 3I/ATLAS using the NOAA's GOES-19 satellite. The comet exhibited significant changes in brightness and colour as it approached perihelion.</p>
<p>Prior to this, scientists noted that 3I/ATLAS experienced its first non-gravitational acceleration as it neared the Sun, with two distinct changes in its orbital plane observed.</p>
<p>Following these observations, researchers, including Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, have begun to explore the implications of these anomalies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The non-gravitational acceleration might be the technological signature of an internal engine,” said Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, highlighting the unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Massive evaporation of 3I/ATLAS might explain its unusual brightening,” Loeb added, pointing to the potential for significant changes to the comet's mass.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has previously exhibited several anomalies, with Loeb listing eight prior unexpected properties. Its latest behaviour, including a blue appearance and significant acceleration, raises questions about the nature of interstellar comets and their interactions with solar radiation.</p>
<p>This incident follows a pattern of unusual observations in the field of comet studies, prompting further investigation into the characteristics of these celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it reemerges in late November and December 2023, with telescopes prepared to capture additional data on its behaviour and characteristics.</p>
