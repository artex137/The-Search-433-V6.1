      <h2>Big revelation on comet 3I/ATLAS leaves scientists stunned: Interstellar object could be 14 billion years</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, only the third known object confirmed to have entered the solar system from interstellar space, has surprised scientists with new findings regarding its age and composition. Michele Bannister, an associate professor at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, has estimated that the comet could be between eight and 14 billion years old, according to a report in International Business Times UK.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it suggests that 3I/ATLAS may be a remnant from the early universe, predating the formation of our Sun. Researchers are conducting further investigations to understand the implications of its unique chemistry and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>Estimated age: between 8 and 14 billion years.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Unique chemistry detected, including rich atomic nickel and iron emissions.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted using the Two-Meter Twin Telescope at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife.</li>
    <li>Projected to leave the solar system completely, following its trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in early July 2025. Over the following weeks, astronomers monitored the comet for 37 nights, observing significant changes in its structure and behavior.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to Earth. Since then, it has continued to drift away from the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The chemistry of 3I/ATLAS is distinctive relative to our solar system comets, which is one of the things that will tell us what its home environment was like,” said Michele Bannister.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the earlier interstellar visitors 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have sparked interest in the study of objects from beyond our solar system. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of research aimed at understanding the origins and characteristics of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from the comet to gain insights into its composition and the conditions of its original environment. Further observations are planned as it leaves the solar system.</p>
