      <h2>7 reasons why scientists believe 3I/ATLAS comet could be an alien mothership</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captured the attention of scientists due to its unusual trajectory and massive size. Researchers have raised the possibility that it could be a technologically advanced alien probe. The object, which is only the third known interstellar object after ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, is currently being monitored as it approaches various planets in our Solar System.</p>

<p>This matter has significant implications for our understanding of interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial intelligence. Authorities, including astronomers and astrophysicists, are studying 3I/ATLAS to determine whether it has artificial origins or if it is a natural phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Diameter: Over 5 km (3.1 miles)</li>
    <li>Mass: Exceeds 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Notable Trajectory: Shows unexplained acceleration</li>
    <li>Current Path: Near Mars, Venus, and Jupiter</li>
    <li>Rotation: Retrograde, opposite to most Solar System bodies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected as it entered the Solar System, prompting immediate interest from the scientific community. Its trajectory has shown unexpected acceleration, leading to discussions about possible propulsion mechanisms. As it continues on its path, researchers have noted its unusual rotation and outgassing behaviour, which deviate from typical comet characteristics.</p>

<p>As of now, 3I/ATLAS remains under close observation by scientists, who are eager to learn more about its composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it is a probe, its pathway and tilt could enable astrometric measurements, determining planetary orbits and masses, key reconnaissance tasks for an intelligent entity,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior interstellar objects like ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have raised questions about the nature of celestial bodies from outside our Solar System. The rarity of such objects makes 3I/ATLAS particularly intriguing, as it poses questions about the prevalence of artificial constructs in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely, aiming to uncover more about its origins and characteristics. Further observations may provide more clarity on whether it is a natural comet or an artificial probe.</p>
