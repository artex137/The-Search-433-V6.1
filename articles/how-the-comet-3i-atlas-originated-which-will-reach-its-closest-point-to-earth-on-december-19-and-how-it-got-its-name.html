      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS to Reach Closest Point to Earth on December 19</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, after being discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025. This interstellar object has intrigued scientists due to its hyperbolic orbital trajectory, indicating it originated outside the solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant for the scientific community as it provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. NASA has been collaborating with experts to gather data on 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The comet is expected to move away from our planet after December 19.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Originated from outside the solar system</li>
    <li>First sighting recorded on June 14, 2025</li>
    <li>Currently located about 670 million kilometers (410 million miles) from the Sun</li>
    <li>Approaching from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The first known sighting of comet 3I/ATLAS occurred on June 14, 2025. Following this, the ATLAS survey telescope reported its presence on July 1, 2025. Since then, NASA has been collecting information about the comet's trajectory and origin.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth, marking a significant moment for astronomers and space enthusiasts alike.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa explains the origin of this comet: "3I/ATLAS formed in another stellar system and was somehow ejected into interstellar space, which is the space between the stars. For millions or even billions of years, it has drifted until it recently arrived in our solar system."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects has become increasingly important for understanding the universe. Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as the third known interstellar object, with its name reflecting its classification. The study of such comets can provide insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach on December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS will continue on its trajectory away from Earth. NASA and other scientific agencies will analyze data collected during its approach to enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
