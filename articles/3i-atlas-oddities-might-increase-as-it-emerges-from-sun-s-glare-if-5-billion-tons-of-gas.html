      <h2>3I/ATLAS oddities might increase as it emerges from Sun's glare</h2>

<p>The Lowell Observatory in Arizona has released a post-perihelion photo of comet 3I/ATLAS, with scientists noting that if it is a natural comet, it should be surrounded by over <strong>5 billion tons</strong> of gas. The potential for anomalies in the upcoming observations has sparked interest among astronomers.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it could reshape understanding of cometary behavior. Researchers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun, and any deviations from expected gas emissions could lead to further investigation into its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Location: Lowell Observatory, Arizona</li>
    <li>Observation date: Post-perihelion</li>
    <li>Estimated gas mass: Over <strong>5 billion tons</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed since it passed perihelion, the point in its orbit closest to the Sun. The Lowell Observatory has been collecting data to analyze its characteristics.</p>
<p>In the recent observation, scientists have raised the possibility of anomalies if the expected gas emissions do not align with the observations. These findings are crucial for ongoing studies of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it is a natural comet, then over 5 billion tons of gas should surround it. In case that is not the case in the upcoming observations, then we might have another anomaly,” said a scientist from the Lowell Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has garnered interest due to its unusual characteristics. Previous observations of comets have often led to new discoveries regarding their formation and behavior, influencing current models in planetary science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS in the coming weeks to confirm the presence of gas and investigate any anomalies that may arise during future observations.</p>
