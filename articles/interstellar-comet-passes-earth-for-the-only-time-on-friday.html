      <h2>Interstellar comet passes Earth for the only time on Friday</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is passing Earth for the only time on Friday, September 29, 2023, coming within 269 million kilometers of the planet. NASA has been observing the comet, which was discovered in July 2023 using a telescope in Chile.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the only opportunity for astronomers and enthusiasts to view 3I/Atlas before it returns to interstellar space. Paul Chodas, director of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, stated that the comet will not return to the Solar System, as it will reach interstellar space again in the mid-2030s.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 269 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Size estimate: Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2023</li>
    <li>Next close approach to Jupiter: March 2024, within 53 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Expected return to interstellar space: Mid-2030s</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, the comet 3I/Atlas was discovered by NASA's Atlas telescope in Chile. Since then, NASA has utilized various telescopes to observe the comet as it approaches Earth. On September 29, 2023, the comet will pass at its closest point to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet, harmless to Earth, may have formed in a star system much older than the Sun, making it a tempting target for observation and analysis,” said Paul Chodas.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is only the third known interstellar object to pass through the Solar System. The first confirmed interstellar visitor was discovered by a telescope in Hawaii in 2017, followed by a second interstellar comet spotted by an amateur astronomer in Crimea in 2019. Unlike domestic comets like Halley's, which originate from the icy rim of the Solar System, interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas come from distant star systems in the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Amateur astronomers are encouraged to observe 3I/Atlas before it fades from visibility. NASA will continue to monitor the comet until it leaves the Solar System.</p>
