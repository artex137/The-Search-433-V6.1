      <h2>Billions of years of interstellar travel likely triggered staggering changes in 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed unusual behavior in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed near the Sun on October 29-30. Researchers have noted that the comet underwent several inexplicable changes during this period, including a sudden brightening and a shift in color, which deviates from typical comet behavior.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it may provide insights into the comet's origins and internal structure. Authorities in the scientific community are investigating these anomalies to better understand the comet's composition and the effects of interstellar travel on its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29-30.</li>
    <li>Notable changes observed included a sudden brightening and a shift from red to blue.</li>
    <li>Researchers involved: Qicheng Zhang (Lowell Observatory) and Karl Battams (Naval Research Laboratory).</li>
    <li>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has referred to the brightening as a "ninth anomaly."</li>
    <li>Potential mass loss of 15% could result in a tenth anomaly according to Loeb.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29-30, 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, the point in its orbit closest to the Sun. Just before and after this event, scientists began to notice significant changes in the comet's behavior, including an unusual brightening that exceeded the typical rates observed in other comets.</p>

<p>Researchers have since proposed that the comet's internal composition or its journey through interstellar space may have influenced these changes, leading to new questions about its origin and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reason for 3I’s rapid brightening, which far exceeds the brightening rate of most Oort cloud comets at similar radial distance, remains unclear,” Zhang and Battams stated in their paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb commented, “If 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, then the non-gravitational acceleration must have resulted from it losing at least 15% of its mass.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS are rare, and their study can reveal new information about the formation of solar systems and the conditions in interstellar space. Prior research into comets has shown that their behavior can vary widely based on their origins, and 3I/ATLAS has presented a unique opportunity for scientists to explore these differences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun again, looking for signs of the predicted mass loss and any further anomalies that may arise, particularly in relation to its non-gravitational acceleration.</p>
