      <h2>Radio signals from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS activate NASA’s planetary defense protocol in rare event</h2>

<p>The detection of radio emissions from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has prompted NASA to activate its planetary defense protocol, a rare occurrence in the field of astronomy. This event was confirmed on October 24, 2025, when the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa captured signals from the comet, which is currently traveling through our solar system.</p>

<p>This activation is significant as it highlights the ongoing efforts by NASA and the global scientific community to monitor potential cosmic threats. The agency's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) has mobilized resources to study the comet's trajectory and characteristics, while also testing the effectiveness of international response systems to potential threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Radio signals confirmed on October 24, 2025, at 1.6 GHz frequency.</li>
    <li>Comet traveling at approximately 100,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Collaboration involved NASA, ESA, and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. This marked the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. Following its detection, the PDCO activated a monitoring operation to evaluate the comet's characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope captured radio signals from the comet, indicating the presence of hydroxyl molecules. This confirmation was critical for classifying 3I/ATLAS as a highly active object.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to Earth, passing at a safe distance of 27 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA’s activation of the PDCO reflects our commitment to planetary protection and scientific exploration,” said a spokesperson for NASA. “The data collected from 3I/ATLAS will enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS follows a series of initiatives aimed at improving global collaboration in monitoring near-Earth objects. In August 2025, NASA conducted a large-scale simulation exercise using 3I/ATLAS as a hypothetical threat to test international response protocols.</p>

<p>This incident highlights advancements in planetary defense, transitioning from theoretical concepts to practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Continuous monitoring of 3I/ATLAS will be carried out by NASA and ESA to gather further data and refine models of comet behavior. The scientific community will analyze the information collected to enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their dynamics.</p>
