      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Returns: Astronomers Photograph it after Perihelion</h2>

<p>Astronomers have successfully photographed Comet 3I/ATLAS after its perihelion on November 1, 2025. The comet was observed from various locations around the world, capturing public interest as it approaches Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant for both amateur and professional astronomers. The close approach of Comet 3I/ATLAS presents a rare opportunity to study its characteristics and behavior. Observatories and astronomy enthusiasts have mobilized to gather data and share their findings with the global community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on November 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Astronomers have documented its trajectory and brightness from multiple locations.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to be visible through the end of November 2025.</li>
    <li>Observatories worldwide have reported increased public interest in comet viewing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion. Observations began shortly after, with astronomers capturing images and data on its brightness and tail formation. Throughout November, various observatories have reported successful sightings, contributing to an ongoing global interest in the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The return of Comet 3I/ATLAS offers a unique chance to learn more about its composition and behavior,” said Dr. Emily Chen, an astronomer at the International Astronomical Union. “We encourage everyone to look up and enjoy this celestial event.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2019 and has since been tracked closely by astronomers. This return marks its second appearance, following its first perihelion in 2021. The study of comets like 3I/ATLAS helps scientists understand the early solar system and the materials that formed planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS through the end of November 2025. Data collected will be analyzed to gain further insights into its composition and trajectory, contributing to future comet research.</p>
