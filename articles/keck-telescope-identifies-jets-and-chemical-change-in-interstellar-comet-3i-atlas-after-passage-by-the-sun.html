      <h2>Keck Telescope identifies jets and chemical change in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS after passage by the Sun</h2>

<p>The Keck II telescope has identified jets and a chemical transformation in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS following its passage by the Sun. The study, conducted by researchers at the Keck Observatory, reveals significant changes in the comet's composition and activity after its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>This research is important as it provides insights into the chemical structures of celestial bodies formed in other star systems and how they react when entering the Solar System. The findings may help astronomers understand the processes involved in the formation of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed using the Keck II telescope located on the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii.</li>
    <li>The study revealed the presence of jets of volatile material and altered chemical structures.</li>
    <li>Significant elements identified include nickel, iron, and cyanogen.</li>
    <li>The comet's brightness distribution is not uniform, indicating active gas and dust emissions.</li>
    <li>The study marks the first post-perihelion full-field spectroscopy of an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, at an unspecified time. Prior to this event, researchers observed the comet at distances greater than 2.5 astronomical units, where it displayed nickel enrichment above typical levels seen in local comets. After perihelion, measurements showed elevated production rates of iron and nickel, highlighting ongoing activity in the comet's core.</p>

<p>The team utilized full-field spectroscopy to map the spatial distribution of chemical elements in the comet's coma, isolating structures that correspond to jets of sublimated material. Notably, the behavior of tricarbon (C3) was distinct, suggesting heterogeneous regions within the comet nucleus.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These discoveries provide crucial clues about the composition of objects formed in other star systems and their reaction to entering the Solar System,” said a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the earlier interstellar objects 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have also provided valuable data on the chemical make-up of extraterrestrial bodies. The study of these comets has prompted astronomers to reassess models of cometary behavior and the processes of nucleosynthesis in different regions of the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observatories, such as the Rubin Observatory, are expected to expand the detection of interstellar objects before they reach perihelion. Continued monitoring of hyperbolic orbiting bodies like 3I/ATLAS will enhance understanding of the materials that compose other planetary systems.</p>
