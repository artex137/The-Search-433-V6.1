      <h2>New Study Confirms Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Made of 'Bizarre' Alien Dust</h2>

<p>An international team of astronomers has confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, formally designated C/2025 N1, is composed of a unique type of dust that defies typical characteristics of comets found within our solar system. The findings were published following observations made in late 2025, during the comet's perihelion, when it made its closest approach to the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing understandings of comet composition and formation. Researchers have utilized advanced polarimetric observations to analyze the comet's dust, revealing that it originated in a chemically distinct environment compared to our own solar system. The study may provide insights into the building blocks of alien planets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey in Chile in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The object travels at approximately 209,000 kilometres per hour (130,000 miles per hour).</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted using the HONIR camera at the Kanata telescope and the NIC instrument at the 2.0-m Nayuta telescope in Japan.</li>
    <li>The polarimetric observations included measurements from visible light at 0.64 µm to near-infrared at 2.25 µm.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS survey in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, astronomers conducted a series of observations to analyze its composition. During its perihelion in late 2025, the comet made its closest approach to the sun, allowing the research team to gather critical data on its dust and polarisation characteristics.</p>

<p>The team observed an unusually large polarisation amplitude, indicating that the dust has a unique 'signature' distinct from typical solar system comets. This stable polarisation phase curve suggests the comet's dust is made from materials that are resistant to heat and wear.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The findings reveal that we are looking at something fundamentally 'other',” said Seungwon Choi, the lead researcher from Seoul National University. “This suggests that the building blocks of this object were forged in an environment chemically distinct from the protoplanetary disk that birthed our own planets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS contrasts sharply with 2I/Borisov, the second interstellar visitor discovered in 2019, which displayed characteristics similar to traditional solar system comets. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS indicates a broader diversity in the types of materials found in interstellar objects.</p>

<p>Prior studies using the James Webb Space Telescope have suggested that some interstellar comets may possess unusual compositions, as evidenced by 3I/ATLAS's coma made up of carbon monoxide instead of water vapor. This highlights the need for further research into the origins and characteristics of comets from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue studying 3I/ATLAS and similar interstellar objects to better understand their composition and origins. This ongoing research may reveal more about the diversity of materials in the universe and the potential for different planetary systems beyond our own.</p>
