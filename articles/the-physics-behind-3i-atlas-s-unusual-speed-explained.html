      <h2>The physics behind 3I/ATLAS’s unusual speed explained</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed traveling at a speed of 58 kilometres per second (about 130,000 miles per hour) on a hyperbolic path as it approaches the Sun. This speed indicates that it is a billion-year-old visitor from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>The speed of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it provides insights into its origin and physical characteristics. Scientists are using this data to enhance their understanding of interstellar objects and improve planetary defence measures.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS moves at 58 km/s, faster than previous interstellar visitors.</li>
    <li>It follows a hyperbolic orbit with an eccentricity of about 6.1.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be over 10 billion years old.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 5 kilometres wide and denser than expected.</li>
    <li>It has shown little change in speed despite releasing gas and dust jets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been traveling through interstellar space for billions of years. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicates it is passing through our solar system rather than being captured by the Sun’s gravity. As it nears the Sun, its speed increases due to gravitational slingshot effects.</p>
<p>Telescopes around the globe and in space are currently tracking its movement, allowing astronomers to study its characteristics and understand more about interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The speed and motion of 3I/ATLAS tell us about its origin and physical makeup, distinguishing it from other space visitors,” said a spokesperson from the research team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar visitors like ʻOumuamua and Borisov traveled at speeds of 26 km/s and 32 km/s, respectively. 3I/ATLAS’s speed and trajectory provide valuable data that may help scientists model the formation and evolution of matter beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, using the data collected to prepare for future interstellar objects and to enhance cosmic knowledge.</p>
