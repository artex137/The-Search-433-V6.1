      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Loses Water Due to Intense Radiation</h2>
<p>In August 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS has lost its water content due to intense radiation, according to findings from NASA’s SPHEREx space observatory. The comet was observed more than three astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, moving at a speed of 58 km/s along a hyperbolic trajectory.</p>

<p>This discovery challenges previous assumptions that 3I/ATLAS was a water-rich comet. The data suggests that the comet's exposure to high doses of radiation may have led to the evaporation of its water, which could have implications for understanding the origins of such interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: August 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: over 3 AU</li>
    <li>Speed: 58 km/s</li>
    <li>Mass loss rate: approximately 70 kg/sec</li>
    <li>Diameter of the comet's core: up to 46 km</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 4.6 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA’s SPHEREx space observatory conducted observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS in August 2025. The spectral analysis revealed a symmetrical cloud of carbon dioxide around the comet and indicated an unexpected absence of water in a gaseous state. The findings suggest that the comet may have experienced significant radiation exposure, affecting its water content.</p>

<p>Researchers used Monte Carlo simulations and the GalPot galactic potential model to trace the comet’s trajectory back approximately one billion years, determining its origin in the thick disk of the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The absence of a bright coma of water gas is puzzling,” a scientist from NASA stated. “This contradicts earlier hypotheses about the comet’s composition.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS's findings contribute to ongoing discussions about the nature of interstellar objects. Previous studies have indicated that such bodies could either be natural celestial formations or potentially artificial constructs. The new data adds another layer of complexity to this debate.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community is awaiting further data from the James Webb Space Telescope, which has also observed Comet 3I/ATLAS. This additional information may provide insights into the comet's composition and characteristics, helping to clarify its origins.</p>
