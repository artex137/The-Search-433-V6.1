      <h2>Avi Loeb on how he'll determine if 3I/ATLAS is 'alien tech'</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard University astrophysicist, has discussed the comet 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. Loeb appeared on "Elizabeth Vargas Reports" to share his insights on the comet's potential significance.</p>

<p>This matter is of interest to scientists and the public alike, as it raises questions about the nature of interstellar objects. Authorities and researchers are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics to gather data and determine its composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>3I/ATLAS is projected to pass between Mars and Earth.</li>
<li>Avi Loeb is a Harvard University astrophysicist.</li>
<li>Loeb has stated that the comet may simply be a rock with ice on its surface.</li>
<li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</li>
<li>The exact date of the comet's closest approach is not disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been identified as an interstellar object, prompting scientists to study its path and composition. Observations and discussions about its nature have taken place in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Loeb's comments on the comet's characteristics were shared during a recent appearance on "Elizabeth Vargas Reports," where he emphasized the need for careful analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb said, "It may well be just a rock, which has some ice on the surface that evaporates."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects has gained prominence in recent years, especially following the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. Scientists continue to explore the implications of such objects for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with ongoing analysis to determine its composition and any potential implications.</p>
