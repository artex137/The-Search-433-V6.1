      <h2>Analysis of the trajectory of comet 3I/Atlas at 57 km/s confirms interstellar origin and hyperbolic route</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is currently traveling through the solar system at a speed of 57 kilometers per second, confirming its interstellar origin and hyperbolic trajectory. The comet's rapid movement prevents it from being captured by solar gravity, allowing it to continue its journey through interstellar space after a brief passage.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers as it marks the third confirmed interstellar object observed in the solar system, following Oumuamua and comet Borisov. The unique speed and trajectory of 3I/Atlas provide valuable data for comparative studies of interstellar objects, enhancing understanding of their dynamics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas travels at 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>It follows a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not bound to the solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, after Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet's unique composition differs from solar system comets.</li>
    <li>Observatories worldwide are tracking its route and predicting its closest approach to the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has been tracked since its discovery, with its trajectory analyzed to confirm its interstellar nature. Observations have shown that as it approaches the Sun, solar gravity alters its direction without slowing it down enough to capture it in a closed orbit. The comet is expected to complete its brief passage through the solar system within a few weeks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I/Atlas provides a rare opportunity to study material from other regions of the galaxy,” said a spokesperson from the International Astronomical Union.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/Atlas, Oumuamua was the first interstellar object detected in 2017, which exhibited unexpected acceleration attributed to the release of trapped water vapor. This phenomenon has prompted further studies to understand the dynamics of interstellar objects compared to those originating within the solar system. The unique properties of these objects challenge existing models and highlight the need for advanced observational technologies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing research will focus on analyzing the chemical composition of 3I/Atlas, which may reveal insights into the conditions of its formation in another star system. Continued observations will also help refine models of interstellar object dynamics as more are expected to be discovered in the future.</p>
