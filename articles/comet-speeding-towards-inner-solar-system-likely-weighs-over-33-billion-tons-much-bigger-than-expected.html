      <h2>Comet speeding towards inner solar system likely weighs over 33 billion tons, much bigger than expected</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/ATLAS is speeding towards the inner solar system and is likely to weigh more than <strong>33 billion tons</strong>, significantly exceeding previous estimates, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. This assessment was made public in a blog post on September 25, 2025.</p>

<p>The findings are important as they provide insights into the comet's composition and trajectory. Astronomers have determined that the comet poses no threat to Earth, but its unusual path could bring it close to other planets such as Jupiter, Mars, and Venus. The comet was first detected in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), a NASA-funded initiative based in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Estimated weight: >33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Diameter of nucleus: >3.1 miles</li>
    <li>Initial detection: July 2025</li>
    <li>Detection method: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Location of ATLAS: Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Composition: Primarily carbon dioxide and water ice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025 through the ATLAS system. Following its detection, astronomers began analyzing its trajectory and mass. On September 25, Avi Loeb published his findings regarding the object's weight and potential impact on the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The diameter of the nucleus of the comet probably exceeds 3.1 miles, larger than the other two interstellar objects previously documented." </blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "The comet poses no threat to Earth." </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This marks the third recorded instance of an interstellar object entering the inner solar system. Previous interstellar objects have provided valuable data on the composition and dynamics of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the inner solar system, particularly its trajectory as it nears Jupiter, Mars, and Venus. Further studies will likely focus on its composition and any potential effects on these planets.</p>
