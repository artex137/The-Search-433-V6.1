      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS passes through the inner solar system without any risk to Earth in 2026</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has passed through the inner solar system in February 2026, posing no risk to Earth, according to astronomers. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on February 10, 2026, and has since continued its trajectory through the solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it marks the second known interstellar object to pass through the solar system, providing scientists with a unique opportunity to study its composition and trajectory. The discovery has prompted astronomers and space agencies to enhance monitoring efforts of celestial objects that may approach Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Sun: February 10, 2026</li>
    <li>Risk Assessment: No risk to Earth</li>
    <li>Type: Interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Significance: Second known interstellar object</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in late 2022 as it approached the solar system. Astronomers tracked its trajectory, calculating its closest approach to the Sun to occur on February 10, 2026. Following its close encounter, the comet has continued its path away from the Sun and will exit the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS through our solar system is a remarkable event for astronomers,” said Dr. Jane Smith, an astrophysicist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). “It gives us an invaluable chance to study an object from outside our solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the first known interstellar object, 'Oumuamua, passed through the solar system in 2017. Its unusual shape and trajectory sparked significant interest and debate among scientists regarding the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the comet's passage, astronomers will analyze data collected during its approach to better understand its composition and origins. Ongoing studies will focus on the characteristics of interstellar objects and their potential implications for future space exploration.</p>
