      <h2>NASA releases images of comet, rejects alien rumors</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, a comet that astronomers believe predates our solar system. The US space agency addressed speculation regarding the object being an alien spacecraft during a news briefing in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Wednesday. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as it contributes to the understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. NASA officials have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a comet, dismissing any claims of it being extraterrestrial technology. The comet was first identified in July by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, and has since been monitored by astronomers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First Spotted:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Discovery:</strong> Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>NASA Briefing Location:</strong> Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Objects:</strong> 1I/’Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by an ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. Since then, astronomers have tracked its unusual trajectory, which suggests it is passing through the solar system from unknown origins. On November 20, 2025, NASA held a briefing to discuss the comet and address rumors surrounding its nature.</p>

<p>During the briefing, NASA officials, including Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, confirmed that 3I/ATLAS shows no signs of being anything other than a comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To start with, I’d like to address the rumors about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. This object is a comet,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya. “It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, referred to the comet as “our friendly solar system visitor” and noted, “We were quick to be able to say: ‘Yup, it definitely behaves like a comet.’”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object observed within the solar system. The first two, 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, were detected in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The scientific community has been keen to study such objects to gain insights into the formation of solar systems and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects as part of its ongoing research into the origins of celestial bodies and the search for signs of life beyond Earth.</p>
