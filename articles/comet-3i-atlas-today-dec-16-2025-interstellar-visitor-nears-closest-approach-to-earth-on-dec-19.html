      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Today (Dec. 16, 2025): Interstellar Visitor Nears Closest Approach to Earth on Dec. 19</h2>

<p>As of Tuesday, December 16, 2025, the interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS is approaching its closest point to Earth, set for Friday, December 19. The comet will be approximately 1.8 astronomical units (AU) away, which is about 170 million miles (270 million kilometers). There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This approach has garnered significant attention from the scientific community and the public. NASA and other reputable agencies have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet's passing is a critical opportunity for scientists to gather data, as it is a rare interstellar object that will not return for potentially decades.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (about 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Reported by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025, at about 1.4 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Expected pass near Jupiter:</strong> March 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus size:</strong> Estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter</li>
    <li><strong>Travel speed:</strong> Approximately 137,000 mph (221,000 km/h) at discovery, increasing to 153,000 mph (246,000 km/h) near perihelion</li>
    <li><strong>Observing window:</strong> November 27, 2025, through January 27, 2026, according to the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Key events in the journey of comet 3I/ATLAS include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>July 1, 2025:</strong> Discovery of 3I/ATLAS reported by the ATLAS survey telescope.</li>
    <li><strong>October 30, 2025:</strong> The comet reaches its closest point to the Sun.</li>
    <li><strong>December 19, 2025:</strong> The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth.</li>
    <li><strong>March 2026:</strong> Expected to pass closer to Jupiter.</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-2030s:</strong> Expected to return to interstellar space.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth,” said NASA officials, emphasizing the comet's safe distance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This flyby is a one-time opportunity to gather data that may not be available for years,” explained a scientist involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed passing through our solar system, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The scientific community views interstellar comets as valuable because they provide insights into the composition and chemistry of other solar systems.</p>

<p>NASA has coordinated multiple missions, including Hubble and James Webb, to study 3I/ATLAS. The International Asteroid Warning Network has also engaged in a Comet Astrometry Campaign to improve measurements of the comet’s position.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, scientists will continue to gather data until January 27, 2026. The focus will shift to analyzing the measurements collected from various observatories to better understand the comet's composition and behavior.</p>
