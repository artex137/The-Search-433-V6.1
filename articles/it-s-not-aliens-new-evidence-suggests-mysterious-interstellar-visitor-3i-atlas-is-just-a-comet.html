      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas Confirmed as Natural Object</h2>
<p>New evidence has confirmed that the interstellar object 3I/Atlas is a comet, not an alien spacecraft, according to researchers from the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. The findings were posted on The Astronomer’s Telegram on Tuesday, following weeks of speculation and conspiracy theories about the object's origins.</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it puts to rest theories surrounding the object’s interstellar nature. The MeerKAT telescope detected a radio frequency pattern consistent with natural comet activity, specifically hydroxyl radicals. Researchers have stated they will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas to gather more data on its characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas is estimated to be the size of a city block.</li>
    <li>Detection of hydroxyl radicals (OH) occurred at 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz frequencies.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>It is expected to pass within 53 million kilometers of Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has been a prominent figure in the discussions about 3I/Atlas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, speculation about 3I/Atlas intensified after Avi Loeb suggested it could be an alien spacecraft. Following this, the MeerKAT telescope began monitoring the object for radio emissions.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, researchers announced the detection of radio absorption signals consistent with comet activity, which clarified the object's nature. Loeb acknowledged that no radio detection had been reported other than the OH absorption signal.</p>
<p>Further observations will be conducted to monitor the comet's behavior and confirm the stability of OH production.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Five weeks ago, I encouraged radio observatories like MeerKAT to search for radio emission from 3I/ATLAS,” said Avi Loeb in a Medium post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“No radio detection of 3I/ATLAS has been reported so far, other than the OH absorption signal,” Loeb acknowledged following the latest discovery.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/Atlas reflects ongoing interest in interstellar objects and their origins. Previous incidents, such as the detection of the “Wow! Signal” in 1977, have spurred similar speculation about extraterrestrial life. The detection of hydroxyl radicals from comets is a well-established method in astronomy for studying such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas for additional data on its OH production and structural characteristics. The next significant observation opportunity will occur during its close pass to Jupiter in March 2026, when the Juno spacecraft will search for additional signals from the comet.</p>
