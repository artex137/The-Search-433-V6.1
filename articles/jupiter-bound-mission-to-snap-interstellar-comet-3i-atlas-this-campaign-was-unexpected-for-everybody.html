      <h2>Jupiter-Bound Mission To Snap Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s JUICE mission will observe Comet 3I/ATLAS between November 2 and November 25, 2023, as it travels through the inner Solar System. This marks a significant event as Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to have crossed the Solar System.</p>

<p>This mission is important because it provides a unique opportunity to study an interstellar comet using JUICE, which is primarily designed to explore the icy moons of Jupiter. The spacecraft will capture data remotely, as it will be approximately 64 million kilometers from the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>JUICE will observe Comet 3I/ATLAS from November 2 to 25, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will be approximately 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>JUICE will be about 64 million kilometers away from the comet.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will be 268 million kilometers from Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Data from JUICE is expected to be downloaded in February 2026.</li>
    <li>Five instruments will be used in the observation: a camera, a near-infrared imaging instrument, a UV spectrometer, a sub-millimetre instrument, and a sensor to image neutral atoms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified just over four months ago. Since then, astronomers have been studying it using various observatories. The JUICE mission has been in a cruise phase, which was not initially planned to include observations of the comet.</p>
<p>NASA and ESA deployed robotic explorers on Mars last week to assist in monitoring the comet, which is currently obscured by the Sun's glare. The first images from Mars may have already been captured, but data transmission will be slow due to the spacecraft's positioning.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This campaign was unexpected for everybody! For JUICE, indeed, we are in a cruise phase during which there are thermal constraints... However, given the uniqueness of these observations, it was decided to prepare this extra observation planning,” said Olivier Witasse, ESA Project Scientist.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Due to the position of JUICE with respect to Earth, the data rate is very low. We expect the data to be downloaded only in February 2026, so we need to be a bit patient,” Witasse added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in the Solar System, highlighting the rarity of such occurrences. The JUICE mission, set to study the icy moons of Jupiter, represents a significant advancement in space exploration technology, particularly in remote sensing capabilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After the observations in November, researchers will analyze the data collected by JUICE, with results expected to be available in early 2026. The mission's primary focus will return to the icy moons of Jupiter as it continues its journey through the Solar System.</p>
