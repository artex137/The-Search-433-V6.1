      <h2>Woman 'in awe' by what she sees in the sky as it took her 'by surprise'</h2>

<p>A gardener in Portland, Dorset, has expressed her amazement after observing what she initially thought was a UFO in the sky on a recent day. Kristin Braund noticed a curious weather phenomenon, known as a Fallstreak hole, while admiring her sunflowers in her garden.</p>

<p>This incident highlights the intriguing nature of weather phenomena and the public's fascination with unidentified flying objects. The Met Office has clarified the science behind Fallstreak holes, which are often mistaken for UFOs due to their unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred in Portland, Dorset, on an unspecified date.</li>
    <li>Kristin Braund is a trainee paraglider.</li>
    <li>Fallstreak holes form in clouds of supercooled water droplets.</li>
    <li>21 UFO sightings reported in Devon between January 2021 and December 2023.</li>
    <li>395 UFO sightings documented in the UK in 2023.</li>
    <li>UFO Identified reported a 20% decrease in sightings from 2022 to 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Kristin Braund was in her garden when she noticed a distinct gap in the clouds. This gap, which resembled a footprint, prompted her to reflect on its unusual appearance. Upon investigation, she learned that it was a Fallstreak hole, created when aircraft pass through supercooled clouds.</p>
<p>Despite her initial surprise, Braund expressed her appreciation for the beauty of the sky, stating that she often admires cloud formations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was in my garden admiring my sunflowers, and I just happened to look at the sky. I always look up as I love the sky and the clouds. I'm a trainee paraglider, so I'm in a constant state of awe with our skies. But this really took me by surprise,” said Kristin Braund.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I've never seen a formation like it before. It was quite unique and had such an ethereal look to it,” she added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Fallstreak holes are a rare weather phenomenon that have been reported sporadically. Their unusual appearance has led to numerous misinterpretations and claims of UFO sightings. In Devon, there has been a notable history of UFO reports, with nearly 2,000 sightings recorded across the UK in the past four years.</p>
<p>According to the annual UFO report from the research group UFO Identified, the UK saw a significant drop in reported sightings in 2023 compared to previous years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are not currently conducting investigations related to the recent Fallstreak hole observation. However, the phenomenon continues to capture public interest, and further reports of unusual sky formations may lead to additional discussions on weather phenomena and UFO sightings.</p>
