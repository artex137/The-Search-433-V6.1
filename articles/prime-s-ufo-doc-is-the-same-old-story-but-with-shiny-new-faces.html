      <h2>Prime's UFO documentary features prominent figures but lacks new evidence</h2>

<p>The documentary _The Age of Disclosure_ has premiered on Prime Video, showcasing interviews with notable figures including members of the United States Congress, Navy fighter pilots, and a former Secretary of Defense. Directed by Dan Farah, the film explores claims of UFO sightings and alleged government cover-ups, but has not presented any new physical evidence to support these claims.</p>

<p>This documentary matters as it continues to fuel public interest in UFO phenomena and government transparency regarding extraterrestrial encounters. Authorities and researchers are revisiting the conversation about unidentified aerial phenomena, especially given the involvement of credible sources in the film.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: _The Age of Disclosure_</li>
    <li>Release platform: Prime Video</li>
    <li>Director: Dan Farah, known for producing _Ready Player One_</li>
    <li>Notable interviewees: Members of Congress, Navy pilots, a former Secretary of Defense</li>
    <li>Claims include: Government possession of UFO wreckage since 1947 and ongoing extraterrestrial visits</li>
    <li>Film's availability: For sale or rental on Prime Video</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, the U.S. government reportedly took possession of wreckage from a crashed spaceship in New Mexico, according to claims presented in the documentary. The narrative suggests that multiple crashes have occurred globally, with the U.S., China, and Russia competing to decode alien technology. The film features interviews with credible witnesses who assert that extraterrestrial beings are monitoring Earth.</p>

<p>Despite the high-profile nature of the interviewees, the documentary has been criticized for lacking concrete evidence to substantiate its claims.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The story the interviewees have to tell will be familiar to anyone who's ever been down a conspiracy theory rabbit hole.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Every one of them was convinced the UFOs were ‘a threat,’ and that if the aliens ever did decide to drop in, then we would all be starring in a remake of _Independence Day_.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary fits into a long history of UFO-related media that often blends speculation with personal testimonies. Previous films and reports have similarly highlighted government involvement and alleged cover-ups, but many have struggled to provide verifiable proof of extraterrestrial life. The recent interest in UFOs has led to renewed discussions about transparency in government investigations of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions around UFOs continue, it remains to be seen how the public and authorities will respond to the claims made in _The Age of Disclosure_. Investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena are ongoing, with many advocating for more transparency from government agencies regarding their findings.</p>
