      <h2>‘Australia’s Roswell’: UFO probe demanded</h2>

<p>Calls for a fresh inquiry into the Westall UFO incident have intensified as the 60th anniversary of the event approaches. The incident occurred on April 6, 1966, near the Westall High School in Melbourne, Australia, where over 200 students and teachers reportedly witnessed an unidentified flying object.</p>

<p>This renewed demand for investigation highlights the ongoing interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and their implications for public understanding and government transparency. Authorities have not yet announced any official plans to reopen the investigation into this historic case.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident Date: April 6, 1966</li>
    <li>Location: Westall High School, Melbourne, Australia</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Over 200 students and teachers</li>
    <li>Current Status: Calls for investigation ongoing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On April 6, 1966, during a school recess, students and teachers at Westall High School reported seeing a flying object hovering in the sky. Witnesses described the object as saucer-shaped and noted that it was surrounded by three aircraft. The event lasted for several minutes before the object ascended and disappeared from view.</p>

<p>In the years following the incident, various explanations have been proposed, including weather balloons and military aircraft. However, many witnesses have remained convinced that what they saw was not of earthly origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The incident remains unexplained, and many of those who witnessed it continue to seek answers,” said a spokesperson for the Westall UFO Group.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Westall incident is often referred to as "Australia's Roswell" due to its significance in UFO lore. It has gained attention over the decades, with numerous documentaries and articles exploring the event. The Australian government has previously conducted investigations into UAP but has not addressed the Westall incident in recent years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the 60th anniversary approaches, advocates for a new investigation hope to pressure authorities into reviewing the case. No official timeline for a response has been disclosed.
