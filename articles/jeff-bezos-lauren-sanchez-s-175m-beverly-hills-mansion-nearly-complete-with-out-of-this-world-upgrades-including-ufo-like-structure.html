<p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez have nearly completed their luxurious Beverly Hills mansion, featuring unique amenities, including a UFO-like structure. The property, purchased in 2020 from media mogul David Geffen, has been under construction for five years.</p>

<p>The $165 million sale, later increased by an additional $10 million lot, ranks among the highest real estate transactions in Los Angeles history. The couple’s extravagant upgrades include a futuristic building resembling NASA’s Apollo 11 space capsule, which may serve as a sauna, according to media reports.</p>
