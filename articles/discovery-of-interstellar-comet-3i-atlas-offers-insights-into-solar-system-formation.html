      <h2>Discovery of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Offers Insights into Solar System Formation</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet identified on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The comet, originating from the constellation Sagittarius, has been recognized as the third interstellar object to enter our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances our understanding of interstellar objects and their implications for solar system formation. Authorities, including astronomers from various institutions, are studying the comet's unique characteristics and trajectory to better grasp the conditions that lead to the formation of solar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) and A11pl3Z</li>
    <li>Date of discovery: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Identified by: NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Location of origin: Constellation Sagittarius</li>
    <li>Composition: 8:1 ratio of carbon dioxide ice to water ice</li>
    <li>Notable behavior: Emitted light from a significant distance, forming a coma and tail beyond Jupiter's orbit</li>
    <li>Upcoming observations: Anticipated as the comet crosses Jupiter’s orbit in the coming months</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers identified 3I/ATLAS using ATLAS. Its unusual brightness and early formation of a coma and tail sparked interest in its origins and composition. Follow-up studies confirmed its comet-like behavior and rich carbon dioxide content, supported by data from the James Webb Space Telescope. As the comet approaches the Sun, additional observations are planned, particularly as it crosses Jupiter's orbit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While 3I/ATLAS may not represent alien life, its status as a rare interstellar object provides a unique opportunity to study phenomena beyond our Solar System,” said Jacqueline McCleary, an astronomer at Northeastern University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins a small group of interstellar objects detected in our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of these objects is crucial for understanding the dynamics of solar system formation and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will conduct further observations to gather more data on its composition and behavior, particularly as it approaches the Sun and interacts with solar radiation.</p>
