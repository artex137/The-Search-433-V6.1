      <h2>The 12th Anomaly of 3I/ATLAS: Orientation of the Jets is Not Smeared by Rotation</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has observed an anomaly involving the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is currently located in the vicinity of the Sun. Preliminary images taken on November 9, 2025, show jets extending over a million kilometers from the comet, maintaining their orientation despite the object's rotation period of 16.16 hours.</p>

<p>This discovery raises questions about the behavior of cometary jets and their relationship to the object's rotation. Astronomers are analyzing the data to understand the implications for comet formation and behavior, with expectations of new measurements in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation date: November 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Rotation period: 16.16 (+/-0.01) hours</li>
    <li>Jet speed: 400 meters per second</li>
    <li>Distance of jets: over 1 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Next expected data: within weeks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July and August 2025, astronomers inferred the rotation period of 3I/ATLAS. On November 8, 2025, images captured by M. Jäger, G. Rhemann, and E. Prosperi showed jets pointing in various directions. A subsequent image on November 9, taken by F. Niebling and M. Buechner, revealed tightly-collimated jets extending over a million kilometers.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2025, D. Jewitt and J. Luu captured another image that suggested a single object, contradicting the notion of multiple fragments ejected from the nucleus.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The observed jets from 3I/ATLAS should have been smeared by the rotation. Instead, they maintain their orientation, which is a new anomaly in our understanding of cometary behavior.” – Avi Loeb
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first anomaly associated with 3I/ATLAS. The object has presented multiple mysteries, including its unusual mass and trajectory, as well as its gas composition, which differs significantly from known comets. With twelve documented anomalies, 3I/ATLAS continues to challenge existing cometary science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb, the head of the Galileo Project, anticipates a surge of new data that may clarify the nature of the jets and the object's behavior. Depending on the results, he may adjust his ranking of 3I/ATLAS on the Loeb Scale, which assesses the likelihood of extraterrestrial technology.</p>
