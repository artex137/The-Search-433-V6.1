      <h2>Horror simulation shows what would happen if comet 3I/ATLAS crashed into the moon and the effect we'd see on Earth</h2>

<p>A simulation has demonstrated the potential consequences of comet 3I/ATLAS colliding with the moon. The simulation, shared by the YouTube channel SimulaVerse, illustrates that the impact would release seven teratons of energy, creating a massive crater on the lunar surface. The simulation does not indicate any injuries or fatalities, as the comet is not expected to approach Earth closely.</p>

<p>This simulation is particularly relevant given the recent public interest in comet 3I/ATLAS, which is believed to be around seven billion years old and is currently traveling at approximately 58 km/s (120,000 mph). NASA has provided a diagram outlining the comet's trajectory, which will see it pass no closer than 270 million km from Earth. Experts are monitoring the comet and addressing public concerns about its nature and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately seven billion years old.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of about 58 km/s (120,000 mph).</li>
    <li>The comet will pass no closer than 270 million km from Earth.</li>
    <li>The simulation shows an impact would release seven teratons of energy.</li>
    <li>The resulting crater would be visible from Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has captured public interest due to its unique characteristics and trajectory. The simulation of a potential collision with the moon has sparked discussions among scientists and the public alike. NASA has shared information on the comet's trajectory to alleviate concerns.</p>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet might be more than a natural object, proposing that it could be a “technological artefact” from an advanced civilization. His claims have been met with skepticism from other scientists.</p>

<p>Professor Brian Cox has publicly refuted speculation about the comet's origins, stating it is a natural object composed of carbon dioxide, water ices, and other materials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Just to be clear - given recent drivel online - Comet 3I/ATLAS is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff,” said Professor Brian Cox. “It is entirely natural in origin, its orbit is as expected and it will whizz around the sun and then disappear off into the galaxy again.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb has proposed two possibilities regarding the comet's nature: “First, that its intentions are entirely benign and second, they are malign.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding comet 3I/ATLAS reflects broader trends in the public's fascination with space and the potential for extraterrestrial life. Previous claims about unusual celestial objects have often led to speculation, prompting scientists to clarify their nature and origins. The ongoing dialogue highlights the importance of scientific communication in addressing public concerns.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Public interest in the object may lead to further discussions and studies regarding its characteristics and potential implications for Earth.</p>
