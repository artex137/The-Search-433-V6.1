      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas develops a layer of 15 to 20 meters by cosmic radiation, reveals James Webb Telescope</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has detected an irradiated crust 15 to 20 meters deep on interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, formed by billions of years of exposure to galactic cosmic rays, according to researchers from the Royal Belgian Institute of Space Aeronomy. The findings were published following observations made in August 2025, when the comet was 445 million kilometers from Earth, traveling at over 210,000 kilometers per hour.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it reveals the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide on the comet's surface, originating from another star system. The study helps scientists understand how interstellar comets differ from those within the Solar System, particularly regarding their chemical compositions and exposure to cosmic radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas passed perihelion on October 29, 2025, at 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Speed: over 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Composition of the coma: dominated by CO2, eight times more than water.</li>
    <li>Estimated age: up to 7 billion years, older than the Solar System.</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Observations recorded jets of gas and intense blue color post-perihelion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile. Initial activity was observed in May 2025, when the comet was 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun. Observations in August 2025 showed the comet at a distance of 445 million kilometers from Earth. The comet passed perihelion on October 29, 2025, initiating the sublimation of its modified layer.</p>

<p>Following perihelion, solar heat caused the release of gas and dust from the irradiated crust, exposing potentially intact internal layers for further study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The formation of this radiated crust has significant implications for our understanding of cometary evolution and the chemical processes that occur on these celestial bodies,” said a spokesperson from the Royal Belgian Institute of Space Aeronomy.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets, like 3I/Atlas, differ fundamentally from those originating within the Solar System. While Solar System comets typically preserve primitive compositions, interstellar visitors exhibit altered chemical profiles due to their exposure to cosmic radiation over billions of years. Previous studies, such as those of comet 2I/Borisov, have highlighted the volatility and distinct characteristics of these objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to continue monitoring Comet 3I/Atlas as it travels through space, analyzing the changes in its coma and tail. Further studies will focus on the comparison of pre- and post-perihelion data to understand its original composition and the impact of cosmic radiation on its surface materials.</p>
