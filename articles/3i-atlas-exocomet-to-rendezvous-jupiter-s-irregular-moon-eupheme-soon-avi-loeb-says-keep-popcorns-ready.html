      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Exocomet To Rendezvous Jupiter's Irregular Moon Eupheme Soon</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, is set to make its closest approach to Jupiter's irregular moon Eupheme on March 17, 2026, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The comet, which was first observed by the ATLAS observatory in Chile on July 1, 2025, has sparked discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the potential for 3I/ATLAS to interact gravitationally with Eupheme. Loeb has noted that if 3I/ATLAS releases smaller objects into orbit around Jupiter, it could signify a technological origin for the comet. The Juno spacecraft, as well as ground-based telescopes, will monitor the encounter closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First observation:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Eupheme:</strong> March 17, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Jupiter:</strong> 30.46 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Relative speed at closest approach:</strong> 66 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring agencies:</strong> Juno spacecraft and major telescopes on Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the outer Solar System's Oort Cloud approximately 8,000 years ago. It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, and conducted its closest flyby of Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 AU, or 270 million kilometers. As it approaches its rendezvous with Eupheme, the comet will be closely monitored for any signs of releasing daughter objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Discovering a fresh 96th moon around Jupiter after March 16, 2026, would constitute a clear technological signature for 3I/ATLAS."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also mentioned, "The outcome of the encounter between 3I/ATLAS and Jupiter will be monitored by the Juno spacecraft near Jupiter as well as by the biggest telescopes we have near Earth."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event follows the discovery of other interstellar objects, including 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The possibility of 3I/ATLAS being a probe sent by extraterrestrial intelligence has garnered attention, although such claims remain unconfirmed. The scientific community is particularly interested in the implications of the comet's interaction with Jupiter and its moons.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its rendezvous with Eupheme, scientists will continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and behavior. The results of this encounter could lead to significant discoveries regarding the nature of the comet and its potential origins.</p>
