      <h2>'Brace for impact': What would happen if 3I/ATLAS comet actually hits Earth?</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in 2024 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii, poses no current threat to Earth. However, scientists have examined the potential consequences of a direct collision with the planet. A high-speed impact could cause catastrophic effects, including massive shockwaves and destruction over hundreds of kilometres.</p>

<p>This matter is significant because it highlights the importance of monitoring interstellar objects and understanding their potential impacts on Earth. NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) and other international agencies continuously track Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) to ensure preparedness for any potential threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our Solar System.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered in 2024 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>Its trajectory is well-studied and poses no current threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Scientists estimate a collision could generate an explosion equivalent to multiple nuclear bombs.</li>
    <li>NASA’s PDCO and international agencies monitor NEOs continuously.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2024 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii. It is identified as a hyperbolic comet, confirming its origin from outside the Solar System. Its trajectory has been well studied, indicating that it does not currently threaten Earth.</p>

<p>Historical events, like the Tunguska event in 1908 and the Chelyabinsk meteor in 2013, have demonstrated the potential impact of even small celestial objects. These incidents provide context for understanding the consequences of larger impacts, such as those from comets like 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While the idea of a collision sparks fear, scientists stress that 3I/ATLAS offers a rare chance for research.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Studying its composition and trajectory could reveal insights into other star systems’ building blocks.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior incidents, such as the Tunguska event, which flattened thousands of square kilometres of forest, illustrate the potential devastation of celestial impacts. The Chelyabinsk meteor injured over 1,000 people with its shockwaves. These events, although smaller than a potential 3I/ATLAS impact, highlight the significant risks posed by interstellar objects.</p>

<p>Space agencies use telescopes like Pan-STARRS and ATLAS to track interstellar objects and calculate their orbits, helping to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic collisions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Currently, there are no immediate threats from 3I/ATLAS. Ongoing monitoring will continue, and if a potential collision were detected in advance, strategies for mitigation would be developed.</p>
