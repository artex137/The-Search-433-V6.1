      <h2>Radio emissions from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS trigger NASA’s planetary defense protocol</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense protocol in response to radio emissions detected from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through the solar system. The comet was first identified in 2019 and has been under observation by various space agencies since its discovery.</p>

<p>This activation is significant as it reflects ongoing efforts to monitor and mitigate potential threats from celestial objects. NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office is assessing the situation and has communicated with international partners regarding the comet's trajectory and any potential implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2019.</li>
    <li>Radio emissions were detected on February 1, 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office is leading the response.</li>
    <li>International space agencies are involved in monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently located in the inner solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2019, comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed by astronomers. On February 1, 2026, radio emissions from the comet triggered NASA’s planetary defense protocol. Following the detection, NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office began coordinating with other space agencies to analyze the comet's trajectory and potential risks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS is a critical moment for planetary defense,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “We are closely monitoring its path and collaborating with our international partners to ensure comprehensive oversight.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>NASA has been actively monitoring near-Earth objects for several years, implementing protocols to address potential threats. Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of many celestial bodies that have raised concerns due to their unpredictable paths and potential impact risks.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS and assess any necessary actions. Further updates will be provided as new data becomes available, and international partners will remain informed of any developments.</p>
