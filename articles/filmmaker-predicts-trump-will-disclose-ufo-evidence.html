      <h2>Filmmaker predicts Trump will disclose UFO evidence</h2>

<p>Filmmaker Farah has stated that the United States could soon reveal information about unidentified aerial phenomena and potential alien contacts. He made these comments while promoting his documentary “The Age of Disclosure,” which argues that U.S. officials have withheld this information for decades.</p>

<p>Farah’s claims come as political pressure mounts in Washington for greater transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. He believes an official statement from the White House is imminent, suggesting that President Trump has already received key briefings on the subject.</p>
