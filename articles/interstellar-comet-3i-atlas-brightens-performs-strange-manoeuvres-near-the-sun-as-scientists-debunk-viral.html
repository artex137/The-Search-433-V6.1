      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Brightens, Performs Strange Manoeuvres Near the Sun</h2>

<p>Mumbai, November 1: The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has brightened unexpectedly and exhibited unusual manoeuvres as it approaches the Sun, according to reports from Space.com. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet’s activity.</p>

<p>This recent behaviour has captured the attention of scientists and social media users alike. Experts are investigating the comet's rapid brightening and strange blue glow, while simultaneously debunking a viral claim that it transmitted a Fibonacci-pattern pulse signal from deep space. Authorities including NASA and the SETI Institute have confirmed no credible data supports this claim.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently nearing perihelion, its closest point to the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet has brightened at an unexpected rate, displaying a blue glow.</li>
    <li>No credible evidence has been found to support claims of a signal transmission.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory detected "non-gravitational acceleration" in the comet's trajectory.</li>
    <li>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested possible explanations for the comet's behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, various observations have been made:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reports indicate the comet has brightened significantly in recent days.</li>
    <li>Social media claims of a Fibonacci pulse signal emerged on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA and SETI have since debunked these claims, confirming no signals were detected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No observatory, including SETI or NASA, has verified any transmission from 3I/ATLAS,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The rapid brightening and unusual trajectory of 3I/ATLAS are intriguing, but natural explanations remain more likely,” stated Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The peculiar behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has raised questions similar to those raised during past interstellar object observations. Scientists often explore both natural and potential artificial explanations for unusual celestial phenomena. However, experts emphasize the importance of relying on verifiable data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion, focusing on its brightening and trajectory. Further studies may clarify the comet's behaviour and whether it aligns with known physical principles.</p>
