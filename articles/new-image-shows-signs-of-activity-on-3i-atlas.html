      <h2>New Image Shows Signs of Activity on 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>As interstellar object 3I/ATLAS travels through the solar system, astronomers have captured a new image revealing signs of activity. The European Space Agency (ESA) released the image taken by the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) on November 2, shortly before the spacecraft's closest approach to the comet, which is set to occur within 41 million miles of Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it offers a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. Scientists are eager to learn more about 3I/ATLAS's composition and behavior as it approaches its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun. Data from JUICE’s instruments, expected in February 2026, will provide further insights into this rare celestial visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter: March 2024</li>
    <li>Image captured: November 2, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 41 million miles</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached: October 2023</li>
    <li>ESA's JUICE spacecraft is on a decade-long mission to study Jupiter's moons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2023, JUICE completed a flyby of Venus to gain speed for its journey to Jupiter. On November 2, the spacecraft captured an image of 3I/ATLAS, which displayed signs of activity. The object reached its perihelion in October 2023, during which astronomers noted an increase in its visible tail.</p>

<blockquote>“Though the data from the science instruments won’t arrive on Earth until February 2026, our JUICE team couldn’t wait that long,” the ESA stated.</blockquote>

<p>The image showed a glowing coma and hints of two tails: a plasma tail and a dust tail. The plasma tail consists of electrically charged gas, while the dust tail comprises tiny particles.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known object from another star system to pass through the solar system. This event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study the characteristics of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will await the arrival of data from JUICE's instruments in February 2026, which will include high-resolution images and spectral readings to further analyze the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
