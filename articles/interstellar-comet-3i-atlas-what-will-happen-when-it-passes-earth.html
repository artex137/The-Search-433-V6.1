      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I Atlas: What Will Happen When It Passes Earth?</h2>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I Atlas is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, according to NASA. The comet, the third confirmed object from outside our solar system, poses no danger to our planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare scientific opportunity for researchers to study the comet's composition and understand more about the formation of other star systems. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Speed of the comet: about 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Estimated size of the nucleus: between 1,400 feet and 3.5 miles wide</li>
    <li>First confirmed: July 2025</li>
    <li>Visibility: detectable with small telescopes, not visible to the naked eye</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar Comet 3I Atlas was first identified in July 2025 after scientists tracked its speed and trajectory. Observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope in July and again on November 30, 2025, helped estimate the size of its icy nucleus. NASA confirmed it is traveling from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

<p>The comet’s hyperbolic orbit indicates it originated outside our solar system and has been traveling through the Milky Way for millions or billions of years. It will not return after its passage through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Interstellar Comet 3I Atlas will pass Earth quietly and safely. Its value lies in the data it provides, not any visible spectacle or risk,” said a NASA official.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The comet offers rare insight into material formed around another star, and studying it may reveal how other star systems form planets,” a representative from the European Space Agency stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar Comet 3I Atlas is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following previous objects that have passed through our solar system. The study of such comets is crucial for understanding the chemical makeup of other star systems and the processes involved in planet formation.</p>

<p>Public interest in the comet has grown, fueled by images captured by telescopes and discussions on social media platforms. Scientists have noted the importance of dismissing speculation regarding artificial origins of the comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches its closest point to Earth, researchers will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition. Observations will remain ongoing into early 2026, providing valuable data for scientists studying the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
