      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Closest Flyby of Earth on December 19</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set for its closest flyby of Earth on December 19, 2023, captivating the global astronomical community. Discovered earlier this year, this interstellar comet has drawn attention from both amateur and professional astronomers. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is an authentic comet, dispelling prior speculations about its nature.</p>

<p>This flyby is significant as it marks the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Astronomers anticipate valuable insights from this event, as the comet embarks on its journey back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach scheduled for December 19 at 1 a.m. EST.</li>
    <li>As of December 17, 3I/ATLAS was approximately 166.9 million miles (268.6 million kilometers) from Earth.</li>
    <li>Livestream event hosted by astrophysicist Gianluca Masi on December 18 at 11 p.m. EST.</li>
    <li>Comet discovered by astronomer Larry Denneau using data from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object in our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered earlier this year by Larry Denneau while analyzing ATLAS data. Initially thought to be a near-Earth object, its classification changed to that of an interstellar comet shortly thereafter. As it approaches Earth, NASA has confirmed its identity, enhancing interest in its upcoming flyby.</p>

<p>On December 17, 2023, the comet was reported to be 166.9 million miles (268.6 million kilometers) away from Earth, moving rapidly towards its closest approach. A livestream event is scheduled for December 18, allowing enthusiasts to engage with the phenomenon before its significant flyby.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “All evidence supports it being an authentic comet from beyond our solar system,” said NASA's Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya during a press conference.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed since 2017. Each encounter with these celestial bodies provides unique opportunities to study their composition and origins, enhancing our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its flyby, researchers plan to analyze the features of comet 3I/ATLAS, hoping to gain insights into the composition of interstellar objects. This study could yield significant findings about the materials present in the interstellar medium.</p>
