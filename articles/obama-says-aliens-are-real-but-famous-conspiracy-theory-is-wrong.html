      <h2>Obama says aliens are real, but famous conspiracy theory is wrong</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has stated that aliens are real, but dismissed a well-known conspiracy theory regarding their existence during a recent interview with podcast host Brian Taylor Cohen. Obama made these comments while discussing the topic of extraterrestrial life on the podcast.</p>

<p>This statement has garnered attention as it challenges long-standing beliefs about UFOs and government secrecy. Obama clarified that he has not seen any evidence of alien contact during his presidency or since. His remarks come amidst ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and government investigations into these occurrences.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Obama made the statements during an interview with Brian Taylor Cohen.</li>
    <li>He has not seen evidence of aliens making contact with Earth.</li>
    <li>The conspiracy theory surrounding Area 51 and the Roswell incident has been a topic of speculation since 1947.</li>
    <li>Former U.S. Air Force Maj. David Grusch testified in 2023 about captured UFOs.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon has denied allegations of a coverup regarding non-human activities.</li>
    <li>Official reports have not linked UAPs to extraterrestrial origins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, a reported UFO crash in Roswell, New Mexico, sparked widespread conspiracy theories about alien life and government secrecy.</p>
<p>In 2009, Obama humorously noted that he asked about aliens upon taking office.</p>
<p>In 2021, a government report stated that officials could not definitively explain aerial phenomena spotted by military pilots.</p>
<p>In 2023, a NASA report indicated that while life on other planets is likely, there is no evidence linking UAPs to extraterrestrial sources.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re real but I haven’t seen them,” Obama said. “And they’re not being kept in… what is it? Area 51. There’s no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” Obama wrote on Instagram. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Roswell incident has fueled conspiracy theories for decades, suggesting that the U.S. government has hidden evidence of alien encounters. Recent testimonies, such as that from David Grusch, have reignited debates about government transparency and the existence of UAPs. Official reports have consistently found no evidence to support claims of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Government agencies continue to investigate UAPs, with no imminent deadlines for findings. Public interest remains high as discussions about extraterrestrial life evolve.</p>
