      <h2>A mysterious comet from deep space is raising big questions at Harvard</h2>

<p>A small, silent object from another star, designated 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), has been detected moving through the Solar System, according to astronomers from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawai‘i. The object was observed on 1 July 2025, marking only the third confirmed interstellar object after ʻOumuamua and Borisov.</p>

<p>This discovery has prompted discussions within the scientific community, particularly from Professor Avi Loeb at Harvard University, who suggests that 3I/ATLAS may not be a natural comet but could instead be a technological artefact. Loeb emphasizes the importance of examining the object closely for signs of artificial origin, raising questions about humanity's place in the cosmos.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of discovery: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Detection agency: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), Hawai‘i</li>
    <li>Designation: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li>Other interstellar objects: ʻOumuamua (2017), Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>Perihelion distance: about 1.4 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 1.8 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Expected monitoring dates: 29–30 October 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS as it moved through the Solar System. Its trajectory confirmed it as an unbound object with a hyperbolic orbit. Following its discovery, Professor Avi Loeb called for further examination, suggesting it may have a technological origin.</p>
<p>In the months following the discovery, observations from various astronomical agencies indicated typical comet behaviour, contradicting Loeb's theories. NASA and other institutions have emphasized that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS generates its own light,” Loeb wrote, “it may be far more interesting than a dusty snowball.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is no reason to think 3I/ATLAS is not a comet,” said astronomer Jason Wright of Penn State, cautioning against attributing intention to natural phenomena.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS mirrors earlier discussions regarding the interstellar object ʻOumuamua in 2017. Both cases highlight the tension between conventional scientific interpretation and more speculative theories regarding the origins of such celestial bodies.</p>
<p>Loeb’s views have sparked significant debate, with some researchers advocating for a more cautious approach to interpreting anomalies in astronomical data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming months, scientists will analyze spectroscopic and radar data to determine the true nature of 3I/ATLAS. This investigation will help clarify whether it behaves like a typical comet or presents characteristics that warrant further exploration.</p>
