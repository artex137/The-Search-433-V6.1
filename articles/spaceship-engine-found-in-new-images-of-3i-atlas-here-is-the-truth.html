      <h2>'Spaceship Engine' Found in New Images of 3I/ATLAS? - Here Is the Truth</h2>

<p>A recent post on X has sparked speculation about Comet 3I/ATLAS, claiming that it may resemble a spaceship engine based on new X-ray images. The images were released between December 6 and 8, 2025, by the XRISM telescope, which is operated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.</p>

<p>This claim matters because it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and the scientific understanding of cometary behavior. Authorities in the scientific community are currently analyzing the XRISM data to assess its validity and implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>X-ray images of Comet 3I/ATLAS were released by XRISM between December 6 and 8, 2025.</li>
    <li>The images reportedly show a glow extending approximately 400,000 kilometres around the comet's nucleus.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a comet.</li>
    <li>XRISM's findings may be influenced by instrumental effects, such as detector noise.</li>
    <li>The scientific consensus is that 3I/ATLAS is a natural interstellar comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 6, 2025, the XRISM telescope conducted a 'Target of Opportunity' observation of Comet 3I/ATLAS, capturing images that sparked viral theories about the comet’s nature. The images displayed a faint X-ray glow around the comet, leading to speculation about alien technology.</p>
<p>However, scientists quickly pointed out that the observed glow might be due to instrumental effects rather than a true representation of the comet's characteristics.</p>
<p>Following the release of the images, NASA and ESA reinforced the idea that 3I/ATLAS is consistent with known comet behavior, stating that they found no evidence suggesting it is anything other than a comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet.”</blockquote> - NASA and ESA officials

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since the discovery of cometary X-rays in 1996, scientists have understood that these emissions arise from the interaction of solar wind with the comet's neutral atoms and molecules. This process creates a diffuse glow rather than a focused engine-like plume.</p>
<p>Previous comets, such as Comet Hyakutake, exhibited similar X-ray behaviors, further supporting the notion that 3I/ATLAS aligns with established cometary characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the XRISM data to determine the nature of the X-ray emissions. The results will inform ongoing research into cometary behavior and may address public curiosity regarding potential extraterrestrial phenomena.</p>
