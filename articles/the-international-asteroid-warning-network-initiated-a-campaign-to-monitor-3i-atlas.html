      <h2>The International Asteroid Warning Network Initiates a Campaign to Monitor 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has launched a campaign to monitor the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, according to an announcement from the Minor Planet Center. This initiative, which is the first of its kind for an interstellar object, aims to improve techniques for tracking and characterizing comets. The campaign is scheduled to run from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</p>

<p>This campaign is significant as it represents a coordinated effort to enhance planetary defense against potentially hazardous space objects. The IAWN, endorsed by the United Nations, is composed of various organizations and astronomers focused on detecting and monitoring Near-Earth Objects. The campaign will also include a workshop to train participants in accurate astrometric measurements, with registration required by November 7, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>IAWN's campaign for 3I/ATLAS is from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>The campaign aims to improve comet observation techniques.</li>
    <li>A workshop on comet astrometry will be held prior to the campaign.</li>
    <li>Registration for the workshop is required by November 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to be closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 21, 2025, IAWN announced the campaign targeting 3I/ATLAS. The announcement highlighted the challenges associated with measuring the trajectory of comets due to their morphological features. Following this, a workshop will be held to prepare participants for the campaign.</p>

<p>On September 30, 2025, a White Paper advocating for global scientific research coordination was submitted to the United Nations. The paper, co-authored by Avi Loeb, Omer Eldadi, and Gershon Tenenbaum, emphasized the importance of monitoring interstellar objects that may pose a threat to humanity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comets present unique challenges for accurate astrometric measurements and orbit predictions,” IAWN stated in its announcement.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The monitoring of interstellar objects has gained attention due to their potential implications for Earth. 3I/ATLAS has displayed several unusual characteristics, which have raised interest among astronomers and researchers. These include a unique trajectory and unusual gas composition.</p>

<p>Prior efforts to monitor Near-Earth Objects have focused on asteroids, making this campaign for a comet particularly notable.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will conduct the campaign from late November to late January, with a focus on improving observational techniques. Researchers will also monitor 3I/ATLAS for any unusual activity as it approaches Earth.</p>
