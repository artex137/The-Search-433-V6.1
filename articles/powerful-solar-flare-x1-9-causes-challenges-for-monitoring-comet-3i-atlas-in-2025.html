      <h2>Powerful solar flare X1.9 causes challenges for monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS in 2025</h2>

<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has recorded an X1.9-class solar flare on December 1, 2025, which has created significant challenges for monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS. The solar flare has caused a coronal mass ejection (CME) that could interfere with space research and monitoring instruments globally.</p>

<p>This solar activity poses challenges for scientists who are adjusting their protocols to ensure accurate data collection on comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile. The comet is the third confirmed interstellar object, and understanding its behavior is crucial for studying exoplanetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of solar flare: December 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Solar wind speeds: exceeding 650 km/s</li>
    <li>Electron peaks in geosynchronous orbit: 8,300 pfu</li>
    <li>Comet's distance from perihelion: 1.4 AU</li>
    <li>Comet's nucleus diameter: estimated 5.6 km</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 1, 2025, NOAA recorded an X1.9-class solar flare. This event was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection that impacted space research capabilities. As the solar eruption coincided with the approach of comet 3I/ATLAS, scientists began adjusting their data collection protocols.</p>

<p>By December 19, astronomers had noted an inexplicable acceleration in the comet's trajectory and detected rotational pulses. The comet's coma has expanded from 13,000 km in June to 18,000 km in July 2025, indicating persistent activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This solar activity significantly complicates readings from space telescopes designed to detect subtle signatures of celestial objects,” said a NOAA representative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are developing new image processing algorithms to filter out noise generated by solar activity and preserve the integrity of data collected from 3I/ATLAS,” stated a researcher involved in the monitoring efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent solar flare is part of a period of intense solar activity, which has seen solar wind speeds exceed 650 km/s. Similar events in the past have disrupted satellite communications and affected data collection from various observatories.</p>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is critical for understanding the formation of comets and exoplanetary systems. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirms its origin outside the Solar System, making each observation essential.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS while developing new algorithms to mitigate the effects of solar interference. Ongoing observations and data collection are expected to provide insights into the comet's organic composition and behavior as it approaches the Sun.</p>
