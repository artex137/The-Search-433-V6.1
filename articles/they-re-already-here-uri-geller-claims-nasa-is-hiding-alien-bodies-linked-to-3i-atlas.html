      <h2>'They're Already Here': Uri Geller Claims NASA Is Hiding Alien Bodies Linked to 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Uri Geller, a well-known psychic, has claimed that NASA is concealing extraterrestrial bodies associated with the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Geller made these assertions during recent interviews and social media posts, reigniting public interest in the mysterious comet, which is currently under scientific examination.</p>

<p>Geller's statements have sparked debate over the intersection of science and belief, particularly regarding extraterrestrial life. The scientific community continues to focus on observing and analyzing 3I/ATLAS, which was first detected on 01 July 2025, while NASA officials have reiterated that the object poses no danger to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Uri Geller claims NASA is hiding alien bodies linked to 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 01 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>The object has been classified as an interstellar comet due to its high velocity.</li>
    <li>NASA spacecraft captured images of 3I/ATLAS in early October 2025.</li>
    <li>No official NASA records confirm Geller's claims regarding alien remains.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 01 July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was detected as the third known interstellar object passing through the Solar System. NASA's ATLAS survey telescope identified it due to its hyperbolic trajectory. In early October 2025, NASA spacecraft orbiting Mars captured images of the comet, contributing to ongoing scientific studies.</p>

<p>In recent months, Uri Geller has made claims about NASA's alleged concealment of extraterrestrial bodies, linking these assertions to his past encounters with NASA personnel in the 1970s. However, these claims lack independent verification and documented evidence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All available data support a natural explanation for the object's characteristics,” said officials from NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Geller is known for his controversial claims and has a history of public demonstrations of psychic abilities. His assertions about NASA and extraterrestrial life have not been substantiated by credible evidence. The scientific consensus maintains that 3I/ATLAS behaves like other known comets, with no indications of artificial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations into 3I/ATLAS continue, the scientific community will focus on gathering more data to understand the comet better. Discussions surrounding Geller's claims are expected to persist, but without credible evidence, they are likely to remain in the realm of speculation.</p>
