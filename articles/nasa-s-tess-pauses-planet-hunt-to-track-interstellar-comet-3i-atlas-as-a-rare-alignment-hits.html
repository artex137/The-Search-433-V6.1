      <h2>NASA’s TESS pauses planet hunt to track interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as a rare alignment hits</h2>

<p>NASA has paused its planet-hunting mission with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to observe interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from January 15 to 22, 2026. The agency announced the special observation in Washington, stating that data will be publicly archived with no proprietary period.</p>

<p>This observation is significant because it coincides with a near-opposition alignment of the comet, which allows for enhanced measurements of comet dust. The TESS Science Support Center indicated that the campaign aims to gather detailed data on the comet’s activity and brightness fluctuations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Observation Dates:</strong> January 15-22, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Ecliptic plane of the solar system</li>
    <li><strong>Sector:</strong> 1751</li>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS, only the third known interstellar object</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Comets:</strong> 1I/’Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Data Release:</strong> Through Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the University of Hawaii first detected 3I/ATLAS. Larry Denneau, a co-principal investigator, noted that observers were still gathering basic information about the comet. On January 15, 2026, TESS began its dedicated observations of the comet, which will continue until January 22, before returning to its regular exoplanet survey.</p>

<p>NASA has utilized various platforms, including Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope, to investigate the comet further. In November 2025, NASA officials addressed speculation regarding the comet being artificial, dismissing such claims as unfounded.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We love that the world wondered along with us,” said NASA science chief Nicola Fox during a briefing. “The alien spacecraft idea is simply nonsense,” added Oxford astrophysicist Chris Lintott.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare occurrences, with 3I/ATLAS being the third object discovered to have originated outside the solar system. The study of such comets can provide insights into the materials and processes that occur in other star systems.</p>

<p>TESS typically focuses on identifying exoplanets by detecting tiny dips in starlight. The current observation aims to gather data on the comet’s brightness and activity, which can yield insights into its composition and history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After January 22, TESS will return to its regular planet-searching activities. Researchers hope to analyze the data collected during the near-opposition observation to better understand the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS as it fades and moves further from Earth.</p>
