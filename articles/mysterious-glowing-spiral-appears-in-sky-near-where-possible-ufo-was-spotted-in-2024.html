      <h2>‘Mysterious’ glowing spiral appears in sky – near where possible UFO was spotted in 2024</h2>

<p>A glowing spiral has appeared in the sky near Wadebridge, Cornwall, on Christmas Day at approximately 6:30 p.m., leaving a local driver stunned. Matt Kipling, who recorded the phenomenon, described it as bizarre and unlike anything he has seen before. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This incident follows a similar occurrence in July 2024, when a suspected UFO was spotted in Torpoint, Cornwall. Authorities have not commented on the nature of the glowing spiral, and investigations are ongoing to determine its origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on December 25, 2023, at approximately 6:30 p.m.</li>
    <li>Location: A30 near Wadebridge, Cornwall.</li>
    <li>Driver: Matt Kipling.</li>
    <li>Previous similar sighting: July 2024, Torpoint, Cornwall.</li>
    <li>Witness of the 2024 event: Charlotte Helyer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 25, 2023, at around 6:30 p.m., Matt Kipling noticed a glowing spiral while driving on the A30. He pulled over to record the lights but was unable to show them to his mother via FaceTime due to poor visibility on the call. Kipling later sent a video to his partner and friends, who expressed surprise at the sight.</p>

<p>In July 2024, Charlotte Helyer filmed a suspected UFO hovering over an estuary in Torpoint, describing it as changing shape and splitting into five parts. This sighting occurred at approximately 11 p.m., and Helyer noted the object's brightness and silence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It was a mystery. I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Matt Kipling, who recorded the glowing spiral. “There was no sound. There was no street lighting and it was completely pitch black.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I would say the distance was about six miles but they were very bright. I can’t explain what they might be. They were too bright to be drones,” said Charlotte Helyer, who witnessed the 2024 event.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>There have been several reports of unusual aerial phenomena in Cornwall in recent years, including the sightings reported by Kipling and Helyer. These incidents have sparked interest in potential explanations, ranging from natural occurrences to unidentified flying objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for an investigation into the glowing spiral or the previous UFO sighting. Further reports or findings may emerge as witnesses share their experiences.</p>
