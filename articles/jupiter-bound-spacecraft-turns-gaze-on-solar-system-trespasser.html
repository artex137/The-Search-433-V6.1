      <h2>Jupiter-bound spacecraft turns gaze on solar system trespasser</h2>

<p>A billion-dollar spacecraft, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice), has observed the comet 3I/Atlas, a rare interstellar visitor, as it travels through our solar system. Launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2023, Juice is on an eight-year mission to explore Jupiter and its icy moons. The comet was first identified in July 2022 and is estimated to be 2.6 km wide, travelling at approximately 220,000 km per hour.</p>

<p>This observation is significant because it provides a unique opportunity to study the composition of an interstellar comet, which could offer insights into the conditions of its parent star system. Scientists aim to determine if our solar system is typical compared to others by analyzing isotopic ratios within the comet. Juice’s instruments were activated during the comet's closest approach, although the spacecraft faced challenges due to solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was first detected in July 2022.</li>
    <li>Juice was launched by ESA in 2023 and is en route to Jupiter.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 2.6 km wide and travels at about 220,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas passed within 210 million kilometres of the sun in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Juice activated five instruments to observe the comet during its closest approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2022, astronomers first identified the comet 3I/Atlas, recognising its trajectory as originating from outside the solar system. Juice was launched in 2023 with a focus on exploring Jupiter and its moons. By late October 2025, the comet made its closest approach to the sun, prompting the ESA to engage Juice's instruments to gather data.</p>

<p>As Juice observed 3I/Atlas, it employed its high-gain antenna as a sunshield to protect sensitive components from solar radiation. This limited the duration Juice could observe the comet, but the data collected is expected to provide valuable insights into its composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We never expected anything like this,” says Paul Hartogh, principal investigator of Juice’s Submillimetre Wave Instrument (SWI). “It’s a kind of gift. Comets are time capsules.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Both previous comets offered unique insights into their origins, with 1I/ʻOumuamua sparking debates about its unusual characteristics. The detection of interstellar objects has increased, indicating improvements in observational technology rather than a rise in their actual occurrence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Data from Juice's observations of 3I/Atlas is currently being processed, with information expected to be released soon. This mission may pave the way for future studies of interstellar visitors as astronomers enhance their detection capabilities.</p>
