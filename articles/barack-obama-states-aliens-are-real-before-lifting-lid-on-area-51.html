      <h2>Former President Barack Obama Claims Aliens Are Real</h2>

<p>Former President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> has stated that aliens are real during an interview on the No Lie podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen, which aired on <strong>October 25, 2023</strong>. Obama confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life but added, "I haven't seen them." He also addressed conspiracy theories surrounding <strong>Area 51</strong>, a classified U.S. Air Force facility in the Nevada Desert, stating, "They're not being kept in Area 51."</p>

<p>This statement is significant as it continues to fuel public interest in UFOs and government secrecy. The U.S. government's acknowledgment of unidentified aerial phenomena has prompted discussions about transparency and the need for further investigation into these claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Interview date:</strong> October 25, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Area 51:</strong> Nevada Desert, United States</li>
    <li><strong>Area 51 established:</strong> 1955</li>
    <li><strong>CIA acknowledgment of Area 51:</strong> August 2013</li>
    <li><strong>Podcast host:</strong> Brian Tyler Cohen</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Area 51 was established in 1955 as a top-secret military facility during the Cold War. The CIA officially acknowledged its existence in August 2013 following a Freedom of Information Act request. In 2016, Obama became the first sitting president to publicly mention Area 51 during a speech at the Kennedy Center Honors.</p>

<p>During the recent podcast interview, Obama humorously recalled how, upon taking office, he was asked about the mysteries of Area 51. His comments have reignited discussions about the facility and its role in the ongoing UFO narrative.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "They're real," Obama said regarding aliens. "But I haven't seen them."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "They're not being kept in Area 51," he stated, addressing the conspiracy theories surrounding the facility.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Now, when you first become president, one of the questions that people ask you is, what's really going on in Area 51?" Obama noted in a previous address.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has been a focal point for conspiracy theorists for decades, with many believing it houses alien technology and life forms. The facility's activities remain classified, and access is heavily restricted. Obama’s remarks reflect a growing public curiosity about government transparency regarding UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UFOs continues to grow, government agencies may face increased pressure to disclose information regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. Investigations into past incidents may also be revisited in light of new public interest.</p>
