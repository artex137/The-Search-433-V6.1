      <h2>Trump Orders the Release of UFO and Alien Government Files</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has ordered the release of files related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and potential extraterrestrial life, according to a statement he made on social media on Thursday night. The directive has been issued to the Pentagon and other government agencies to begin identifying and releasing relevant files.</p>

<p>This order is significant as it reflects the growing public interest in UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Lawmakers are pushing for further investigations into these sightings, which they believe could pose a threat to national security. Trump's statement follows claims made by former President Barack Obama regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life, although Obama clarified that he has not seen evidence of alien contact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Order issued by President Donald Trump on Thursday night.</li>
    <li>Files on UFOs and extraterrestrial life to be released by the Pentagon and other agencies.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>Last year, a House Republican released a video showing a U.S. missile striking an unidentified object, which reportedly bounced off and appeared orb-like. The military's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has been tracking UAPs for decades but has found no evidence of extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To begin the process of identifying and releasing” files that are relevant to the matter, Trump instructed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other agencies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” Obama stated, while also noting that he has not seen any evidence that aliens have made contact with Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UFOs has surged in recent years, leading to increased scrutiny of military reports on unidentified aerial phenomena. While many sightings have been debunked as birds, balloons, drones, or satellites, a number of cases remain unresolved. The AARO has stated that it has found no evidence of extraterrestrial activity despite the ongoing investigations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Pentagon and other agencies will begin the process of identifying and releasing files as directed by Trump. Investigations into UAP sightings are expected to continue, with lawmakers seeking to determine any potential threats to national security.</p>
