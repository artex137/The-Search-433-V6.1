      <h2>'Alien-hunting spacecraft' tracks interstellar object 3I/ATLAS passing Earth</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its closest approach to Earth today, December 19, 2023, and NASA’s Europa Clipper spacecraft is tracking it from a distance of approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometers). There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object recorded to enter our solar system. Authorities are using this opportunity to gather data on the comet, which could provide insights into its composition and origin. NASA plans to share its findings as they become available.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Speed of comet: Estimated at 246,000 kilometers per hour (153,000 mph)</li>
    <li>NASA spacecraft involved: Europa Clipper</li>
    <li>Lead NASA scientist: Tom Statler</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been monitored for several months as it approached Earth. Today marks its closest point to our planet, offering researchers a unique opportunity to study this interstellar object.</p>

<p>NASA’s Europa Clipper has been capturing images and analyzing emissions from the comet. This mission aims to uncover more about the comet's properties and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said lead NASA scientist Tom Statler.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “When there are implications to society, we must consider even an unlikely event and collect as much data as possible to convince us otherwise,” said physicist Avi Loeb regarding the potential implications of the comet.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of the few interstellar objects detected since the first, ‘Oumuamua, in 2017. Its unusual trajectory has sparked debate among scientists about its origins and nature, with some suggesting it could be of alien origin. However, NASA has consistently stated that the evidence overwhelmingly supports its classification as a comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze data collected from the Europa Clipper and share findings as they are made available. Researchers will monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from Earth to further understand its characteristics.</p>
