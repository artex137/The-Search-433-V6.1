      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Nearing Earth: What Scientists Discovered</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, is approaching Earth, with its closest point expected on December 19, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, this comet has generated excitement among astronomers as it is only the third interstellar object observed in our solar system.</p>

<p>The significance of Comet 3I/ATLAS lies in its unique origin, providing scientists with a rare opportunity to study material from outside our solar system. As the comet nears, missions from the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) are capturing detailed images and data to analyze its composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 167 million miles (270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Hubble's observation date: November 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during Hubble's observation: 178 million miles (286 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of comet nucleus: 440 metres to 5.6 kilometres</li>
    <li>Juice mission launched: April 2023, with arrival at Jupiter expected in July 2031</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Astronomers confirmed its interstellar status due to its high velocity and hyperbolic trajectory. The Hubble Space Telescope observed the comet on November 30, 2025, providing detailed images that helped refine the comet's trajectory and estimate its size.</p>

<p>In early November 2025, the Juice mission was 41 million miles (66 million kilometres) from the comet, allowing for observations using its scientific instruments. The mission collected preliminary data showing heat-driven activity on the comet resulting from its close pass by the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have been crucial in narrowing down the size of the comet’s nucleus,” said an unnamed mission scientist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for science to peek into the chemistry of another star system,” added another researcher involved in the analysis.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed to pass through our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of these objects can provide insight into the formation and evolution of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<p>Previous observations of ‘Oumuamua sparked debate due to its unusual shape and lack of a tail, while 2I/Borisov behaved more like typical comets found in our solar system. The unique features of Comet 3I/ATLAS may further enhance our understanding of interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Juice mission is expected to transmit additional data, including high-resolution images and composition analysis, between February 18 and 20, 2026. Scientists will analyze this data to determine the comet's chemical composition and its implications for understanding the galaxy’s history.</p>
