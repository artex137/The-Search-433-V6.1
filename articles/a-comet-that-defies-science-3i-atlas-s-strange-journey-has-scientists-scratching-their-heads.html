      <h2>A Comet That Defies Science? 3I/ATLAS’s Strange Journey Has Scientists Scratching Their Heads</h2>

<p>Astronomers are closely monitoring the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited unusual behaviour since its discovery in July 2023 at a telescope in Chile. The comet has unexpectedly accelerated, changed colour, and lost its tail, prompting confusion among scientists. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, as it will pass approximately 269 million kilometres away in December.</p>

<p>This unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it challenges existing scientific understanding of cometary dynamics. NASA and the European Space Agency are collaborating to track the comet's journey towards Jupiter in March 2026, seeking to understand the underlying causes of its rapid changes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS survey team in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth will be in December 2023.</li>
    <li>Current speed is approximately 2,44,600 km/h.</li>
    <li>Estimated to lose about 10% of its mass in one month.</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed the comet poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever detected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS survey team. By late October, the comet appeared brighter and changed to a noticeable blue hue as it approached the Sun. Observations indicated an increase in speed and an unexplained “kick” that scientists could not attribute solely to gravitational forces. In November, astronomers noted the comet had lost its tail, which typically forms from material heated by solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet seems to be experiencing non-gravitational acceleration,” said NASA navigation engineer Davide Farnocchia.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “As it expels this material at a greater rate, it is being kicked in the opposite direction,” explained Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb regarding the comet's unusual acceleration.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We don’t have any evidence for the gas coma changing colours,” stated astronomer Qicheng Zhang from the Lowell Observatory, addressing reports of multiple colour changes.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Nearly 13 per cent of its mass should have formed a tail, but none is visible,” added Loeb, commenting on the comet's tail disappearance.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Its discovery has reignited interest in the study of interstellar objects and their characteristics, particularly regarding their composition and behaviour as they travel through the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it progresses towards Jupiter. Scientists aim to gather more data to better understand the comet's unusual features and the implications for interstellar objects.</p>
