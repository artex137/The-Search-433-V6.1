      <h2>Plasma Physicist Reveals 3I/ATLAS Is Visible—Not Hidden Behind the Sun</h2>

<p>A renowned plasma physicist has claimed that the comet-like object 3I/ATLAS is visible and not obscured behind the Sun, according to a post by Dr. John Brandenburg on X (formerly Twitter). This assertion challenges earlier commentary that suggested the interstellar visitor was hidden from view as it passed behind the Sun.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked significant interest among astronomers and researchers. Authorities are now closely examining the object's trajectory and behavior, as its visibility could change the understanding of how interstellar objects interact with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Claimed Visibility:</strong> Visible, according to Dr. John Brandenburg</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> Approximately 29 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Perihelion:</strong> Roughly 1.36 AU from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> By the ATLAS survey</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Ongoing debate among astronomers regarding visibility</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey and designated as the third known interstellar object. In September, Dr. Brandenburg reported observing an apparent jet exhaust towards the Sun, which he claims has reversed. This contradicts earlier reports indicating that the object was behind the Sun and not visible from Earth. The object is expected to reach perihelion on 29 October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Object 3I ATLAS had an apparent jet exhaust towards the Sun in Sept., producing a braking effect. This has now apparently reversed.” — Dr. John Brandenburg</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS is not just about visibility. It touches on how interstellar objects interact with solar radiation and magnetic fields. This is significant because it could change how astronomers study near-solar phenomena and interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away from the Sun's glare, astronomers will use ground-based and orbital telescopes to confirm Dr. Brandenburg's visibility claims. This period will be critical for gathering data and understanding the object's behavior under solar conditions.</p>
