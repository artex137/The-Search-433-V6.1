      <h2>Tracking Comet 3I/ATLAS during NASA's Silence</h2>
<p>When NASA's communications were interrupted due to a temporary shutdown of the United States government in late October, India's network of observatories took over the tracking of comet 3I/ATLAS, ensuring vital data on the interstellar object was preserved. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>
<p>This incident highlights the importance of international collaboration in space exploration, especially during critical periods. With NASA unable to provide updates, Indian astrophysicists quickly mobilized to maintain observation of 3I/ATLAS, which is significant as it is the third interstellar object ever identified.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified.</li>
  <li>The U.S. government shutdown occurred in late October 2023, impacting NASA's communications.</li>
  <li>Indian observatories involved include the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), ARIES Nainital, and IUCAA Pune.</li>
  <li>The Devasthal ARIES Optical Telescope, with a 3.6-meter mirror, was the primary observation instrument.</li>
  <li>Data from India helped maintain the global observation network, allowing European partners to recalibrate models.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2023, NASA's communications were disrupted due to a U.S. government shutdown. As a result, astronomers worldwide experienced a data blackout regarding comet 3I/ATLAS. In response, Indian observatories reorganized their observation schedules and initiated emergency monitoring of the comet.</p>
<p>The Devasthal ARIES Optical Telescope became the main instrument for tracking the comet, with teams working night shifts to gather essential data. Despite challenges, Indian institutions managed to send information to the Minor Planet Center, ensuring the continuity of global triangulation efforts.</p>
<p>As visibility of 3I/ATLAS diminished, the data collected by Indian researchers proved crucial for reconstructing the object's orbit and understanding its origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It was one of those nights when the stars felt like a responsibility,” reported a researcher from the Vainu Bappu observatory in Tamil Nadu, reflecting on the urgency of the situation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This situation underscores the reliance of global astronomical networks on shared data and the vulnerabilities that arise during administrative disruptions. The incident serves as a reminder that the scientific community must remain adaptable, especially when major space agencies face operational challenges.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As data from India continues to circulate among research centers globally, the scientific community is expected to further analyze the findings from 3I/ATLAS. Future collaboration between countries may enhance resilience against similar disruptions in space exploration.</p>
