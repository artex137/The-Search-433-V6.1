      <h2>Interstellar comet with ‘a heartbeat’ to pass near Earth this month</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, when it will be approximately 170 million miles away. The comet has gained attention for its unusual dimming and brightening behaviour, which has been compared to a heartbeat, according to NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

<p>This flyby offers an opportunity for scientists to study the comet's composition and behaviour. New images from the Hubble Space Telescope and ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) have provided insights into the comet's structure, including the presence of two tails made of plasma and dust. Observations of 3I/ATLAS could enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during closest approach: approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Hubble Space Telescope captured images on November 30, 2023</li>
    <li>Juice spacecraft observed the comet from 41 million miles away</li>
    <li>Comet’s activity includes periodic jets of gas every 16 hours</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is believed to be billions of years older than the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 30, 2023, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope captured images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing its unique characteristics from a distance of about 178 million miles. ESA’s Juice spacecraft later observed the comet from 41 million miles away, noting the presence of two distinct tails.</p>
<p>As scientists have studied the comet, they have noted its unusual behaviour, which has sparked discussions about its potential origins, including theories surrounding alien technology. However, experts like Dr. Matthew Genge have suggested that the comet's behaviour is likely a natural phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it’s a heartbeat, then those aliens are really, really, super chill,” said Dr. Matthew Genge, a micrometeorite and cosmic dust expert at Imperial College London.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet, it behaves like a comet… therefore, it’s most likely a comet,” Dr. Genge added, emphasizing the natural characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three interstellar comets observed to date, following Oumuamua in 2017. The study of such comets is important for understanding the dynamics of our solar system and the potential prevalence of interstellar objects, which may be more common than previously thought.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach on December 19, 2023, 3I/ATLAS will continue on its path out of the solar system. Astronomers and enthusiasts will monitor the comet for several months, but interest is expected to wane once it departs without incident.</p>
