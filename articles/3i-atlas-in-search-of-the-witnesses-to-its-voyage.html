      <h2>3I/ATLAS: In Search Of The Witnesses To Its Voyage</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered to date, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The findings were reported on September 9, 2025, by a team of researchers, including X. Pérez-Couto and S. Torres. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the study of this comet.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant for understanding the Galactic population of icy planetesimals. Researchers aim to trace its past trajectory to assess the potential role of stellar encounters in its origin and orbit. The study has integrated data from Gaia DR3 stars to identify past close encounters within 2 parsecs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered.</li>
    <li>Research integrated the orbit of 3I/ATLAS backward in time for 10 million years.</li>
    <li>93 nominal encounters were identified, with 62 significant at the 2σ level.</li>
    <li>The closest significant perturber was Gaia DR3 6863591389529611264, at 0.30 parsecs away.</li>
    <li>The study was submitted to ApJL and includes 12 pages and 5 figures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered as part of ongoing research into interstellar objects. The research team has analyzed the object's trajectory and potential interactions with nearby stars.</p>
<p>Using data from Gaia DR3, the team has identified 93 close encounters over the last 10 million years. Despite these encounters, none produced significant changes to the orbit of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>The findings were submitted for publication on September 9, 2025, detailing the lack of perturbation from stellar flybys in the vicinity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our results indicate that no stellar flybys within the past 10 million years can account for the present trajectory of 3I/ATLAS,” said X. Pérez-Couto.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is kinematically consistent with a thin-disk population, despite its large peculiar velocity,” added S. Torres.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior discoveries of interstellar objects, such as 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have raised interest in the dynamics of these celestial bodies. The study of 3I/ATLAS contributes to a growing body of knowledge regarding the origins and behaviors of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are expected to further investigate the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and its implications for the study of interstellar objects. Future studies may focus on enhancing data collection and analysis methods to improve understanding of similar celestial bodies.</p>
