      <h2>US Military Whistleblowers Testify on UFO Encounters</h2>

<p>A group of US military whistleblowers has detailed their close encounters with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during a congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) held recently. Three veterans from the Air Force and Navy testified under oath about alleged attempts by the United States intelligence community to cover up these encounters. The hearing included the presentation of shocking footage from an incident on October 30, 2024, showing a US military missile striking a glowing UFO off the coast of Yemen.</p>

<p>This testimony is significant as it raises questions about government transparency regarding UAPs. The veterans claim that the US government has actively sought to suppress information about these encounters and has retaliated against those who come forward, including blacklisting one veteran.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on October 30, 2024.</li>
    <li>The footage showed a Hellfire missile striking a UFO off the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>Three military veterans testified during the congressional hearing.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon's AARO reports 21 unresolved UAP incidents to date.</li>
    <li>The Hellfire missile AGM-114 weighs 100 pounds (45 kg).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the congressional hearing, Congressman Eric Burlison presented never-before-seen footage of a missile strike on a UFO. The incident, which took place on October 30, 2024, involved a Hellfire missile fired by US military forces. Despite the missile's direct hit, the unidentified object continued to travel at high speed.</p>
<p>The veterans shared their experiences with various UAPs, including glowing cubes larger than a football field and Tic Tac-shaped vehicles, describing the challenges they faced when reporting these incidents.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The US intelligence community has tried to cover up many encounters,” said one veteran during the hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The government forged my documents and manipulated my security clearance to prevent me from getting work,” stated Air Force geospatial intelligence specialist Dylan Borland.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing is part of a broader effort by Congress to investigate UAPs and the government's response to them. The claims made by the veterans highlight ongoing concerns about transparency and accountability within the military and intelligence agencies regarding unidentified phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the allegations made by the veterans are expected to continue, with further congressional hearings likely as lawmakers seek to understand the extent of the US government's knowledge and response to UAPs.</p>
