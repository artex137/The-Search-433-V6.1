      <h2>Do the Anomalies of 3I/ATLAS Flag Alien Technology or an Unfamiliar Interstellar Iceberg?</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb has raised questions about the nature of comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on July 1, 2025. Loeb's analysis suggests that this comet may not be a typical water-rich comet, but rather something more unusual, potentially an interstellar artifact. The discussion follows a recent interview on Fox News on November 16, 2025.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges conventional views on comet classification and suggests the need for a broader framework in understanding interstellar objects. Loeb argues that humanity's technological objects should be included in the dataset for comet studies, which could reshape our understanding of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb's interview aired on November 16, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be a million times more massive than 1I/‘Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has displayed unusual sunward jets, challenging typical comet behavior.</li>
    <li>The comet's retrograde trajectory aligns with the ecliptic plane with a 0.2% probability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS. Initial assessments categorized it as a typical water-rich comet. However, as observations continued, anomalies became apparent.</p>
<p>In August and early November 2025, 3I/ATLAS displayed a sunward jet, prompting further investigation into its composition and behavior. On November 16, Loeb discussed these findings in an interview, emphasizing the need to reconsider the classification of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The foundation of science is based on the humility to learn, not the arrogance of expertise,” said Loeb during his interview with Fox News.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Would comet experts recognize these visitors as technological artifacts if their training data set includes only icy rocks? I do not think so,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the discovery of 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 raised similar questions about the nature of interstellar objects. Experts have debated the classification of such objects, often relying on historical data that primarily includes icy comets.</p>
<p>Loeb argues that the traditional dataset may limit our understanding of potential interstellar artifacts, which could include advanced technology from other civilizations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into 3I/ATLAS are expected as astronomers continue to analyze its trajectory and behavior. Loeb advocates for a reassessment of comet classification to include technological artifacts in future studies.</p>
