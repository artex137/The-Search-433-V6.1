      <h2>New image reveals comet 3I/ATLAS emerging from behind the Sun over Egypt</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has become visible again after passing behind the Sun in autumn 2025, with a new image captured by photographer Osama Fathi in Egypt's Black Desert on 29 November 2025 at approximately 03:00 local time.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it marks the comet's return to visibility for amateur astronomers and enthusiasts. Authorities and astronomy communities encourage observers to photograph the comet and share their images, as it is expected to pass through the Solar System only once before heading back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS emerged from behind the Sun in autumn 2025.</li>
    <li>Photographer Osama Fathi captured the comet on 29 November 2025 at 03:00 local time.</li>
    <li>The image was taken in Egypt's Black Desert using an astro-modified Nikon Z6 camera.</li>
    <li>Fathi utilized a RedCat telescope lens with 3× optical zoom.</li>
    <li>The comet has been imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and NASA solar observatories.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 6 August 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope observed comet 3I/ATLAS with its Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument, providing new data on its composition.</p>
<p>After passing behind the Sun in autumn 2025, the comet re-emerged, becoming visible to observers once again.</p>
<p>On 29 November 2025, Osama Fathi captured a detailed image of the comet in Egypt's Black Desert, employing long exposure techniques.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“An object from another star system drifts through our sky,” Fathi said, highlighting the significance of the comet's presence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These long integrations allowed the comet’s delicate coma and motion against the background stars to emerge clearly,” he added, explaining his photographic technique.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet, which means it originated from outside the Solar System. This rare occurrence provides valuable opportunities for scientific observation and public engagement in astronomy.</p>
<p>Prior to this sighting, the comet had been monitored by various spacecraft, enhancing our understanding of its characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers are encouraged to capture and share their own images of comet 3I/ATLAS, as it travels through the Solar System. The astronomy community continues to provide resources and guides for amateur photographers to document this rare celestial event.</p>
