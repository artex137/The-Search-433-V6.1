      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS an Alien Craft? CIA Won't Confirm or Deny Records Exist</h2>

<p>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has refused to confirm or deny the existence of classified records regarding the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, which was first detected by the ATLAS observatory in Chile in July 2025. The CIA's response has reignited public interest and debate surrounding the object, especially after it made its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025 at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</p>

<p>This situation highlights the tension between transparency and national security as the scientific community largely supports the notion that 3I/ATLAS is a natural phenomenon. NASA has consistently stated that the object, estimated to be between 8 and 14 billion years old, likely originates from the Milky Way's ancient 'thick disk'. The CIA's ambiguous stance, however, has led to speculation and concern among UFO researchers and enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Researcher Involved:</strong> John Greenewald Jr.</li>
    <li><strong>Agency Response Date:</strong> 31 December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, scientists at the ATLAS observatory in Chile first detected 3I/ATLAS. The object gained attention as it approached the solar system. On 19 December 2025, it made its closest approach to Earth.</p>
<p>On 31 December 2025, John Greenewald Jr., a UFO researcher, received a response from the CIA stating it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of records related to 3I/ATLAS, using a classic 'Glomar response'. This response indicates that the existence or nonexistence of such records is classified.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact of the existence or non-existence of such records is itself currently and properly classified,” the CIA stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, described the CIA's vagueness as “surprising” and noted the disconnect between the scientific community and intelligence agencies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CIA's use of the 'Glomar response' dates back to the 1970s and is typically reserved for high-level national security matters. The CIA's application of this response to 3I/ATLAS has raised questions, especially since NASA maintains that the object is simply a natural space rock.</p>
<p>Loeb has previously speculated that 3I/ATLAS could be a 'Trojan Horse'—a technological probe disguised as a comet. This notion reflects broader concerns about the implications of unidentified objects in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the debate continues, researchers like Avi Loeb are looking forward to March 2026, when 3I/ATLAS will pass Jupiter. This future event may provide further opportunities for study and could influence ongoing investigations into the object's nature.</p>
