      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas reappears without its tail after passing behind the Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has reappeared in the night sky after several weeks of disappearance, but it is missing its characteristic glowing tail, according to reports. The comet passed behind the Sun in late October 2025 and became visible again on November 10, 2025.</p>

<p>The absence of the comet's tail has raised questions among astronomers about the effects of its close encounter with the Sun. Scientists are currently observing 3I/Atlas with ground-based and space telescopes to understand the implications of this phenomenon for future studies of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was first spotted in 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar comet, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet passed behind the Sun in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>It became visible again on November 10, 2025.</li>
    <li>Experts are studying the comet using ground-based and space telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first observed earlier in 2025, drawing interest due to its rapid movement, indicating it originated from another star system. The comet passed behind the Sun in late October 2025, reaching its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, where it became impossible to observe from Earth.</p>

<p>After a period of invisibility, 3I/Atlas reemerged on November 10, 2025. Upon its reappearance, astronomers quickly noted that the comet lacked its usual bright tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The intense heat from the Sun might have caused the ice and gas that made up the tail to burn away,” a scientist said. “The absence of the tail offers a unique opportunity to learn more about interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is significant because it is only the third interstellar comet observed, following a trend of increasing interest in objects from beyond our Solar System. Previous comets, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the composition and behavior of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas to gather data on its composition and behavior after its close encounter with the Sun. This research may enhance our understanding of how solar radiation affects comets and their structures.</p>
