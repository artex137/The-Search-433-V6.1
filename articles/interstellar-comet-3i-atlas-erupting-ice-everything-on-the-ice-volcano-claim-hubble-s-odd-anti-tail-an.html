      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Erupting Ice? Everything on the ‘Ice Volcano’ Claim, Hubble’s Odd Anti-Tail</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has gained attention following new observations that have sparked scientific excitement and debate. NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope released a new image on November 30, 2025, showing an unusual anti-tail. Meanwhile, a European research team has suggested the comet may be exhibiting cryovolcanism, or “ice volcanoes,” on its surface.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may enhance understanding of cometary behavior and the nature of interstellar objects. Researchers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS with upcoming observations from Hubble, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and ESA’s JUICE spacecraft to confirm these findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 286 million km from Earth as of December 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet passed perihelion in late October 2025, at about 1.36 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Its incoming speed is approximately 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>Hubble captured a new image of 3I/ATLAS showing a teardrop-shaped inner coma and an anti-tail extending about 60,000 km sunward.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently at magnitude ~12, moving from the constellation Virgo towards Leo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope. It passed perihelion in late October 2025 and has been observed by various telescopes since then.</p>

<p>On November 30, 2025, Hubble released a new image of the comet, revealing a teardrop-shaped inner coma and an unusual anti-tail. Following this, a European research team proposed that the comet may be exhibiting cryovolcanism, based on high-resolution images captured as it approached perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“A large number of macroscopic, non-volatile objects may have separated from the comet due to non-gravitational acceleration,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, regarding the implications of Hubble’s new image.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The jets that we observe could be explained by normal cometary activity, but upcoming spectroscopy will be crucial for testing our cryovolcanism hypothesis,” stated Josep M. Trigo-Rodríguez, a member of the European research team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed, following ʻOumuamua and Borisov. Its discovery has prompted increased interest in the study of interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>

<p>Scientists have identified several components in the comet's atmosphere, including CO₂, water ice, carbon monoxide, carbonyl sulfide, cyanide, and nickel vapour.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further spectroscopy using Hubble, JWST, and JUICE to investigate the nature of the jets observed on 3I/ATLAS and to confirm whether they are indicative of cryovolcanism or normal cometary activity.</p>
