      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may reveal building blocks of life</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has garnered global scientific interest since its discovery on July 1, 2023, by NASA's ATLAS program in Chile. The comet is the third interstellar object ever detected, following Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this discovery.</p>

<p>This comet may provide valuable insights into the formation of the solar system and the origins of life. Authorities, including the European Space Agency (ESA), are preparing to observe 3I/ATLAS with their Juice spacecraft, currently en route to Jupiter. Scientists are particularly eager to study the comet as it approaches the sun in November, when its activity is expected to increase.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2023, by NASA's ATLAS program in Chile.</li>
    <li>Third interstellar object detected, after Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
    <li>Travels at over 200,000 kilometers per hour (124,274 miles per hour).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun expected in November 2023.</li>
    <li>ESA plans to observe 3I/ATLAS using the Juice spacecraft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, NASA's ATLAS program discovered the comet 3I/ATLAS in Chile. Following its discovery, the Hubble Space Telescope conducted observations to gather more information about the comet's characteristics. In November 2023, the comet is expected to be closest to the sun, leading to increased activity and a brighter tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a message in a bottle from another solar system. We don't know which one, but it's our only and best chance to understand something that comes from a place that originated long before our own solar system,” said Christina Toldbo, astrophysicist and head of the Round Tower Observatory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Just because there is something we can't explain doesn't mean it has to be aliens. It's probably more about the fact that we haven't seen very many interstellar comets before,” Toldbo added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the detection of two earlier interstellar objects, Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have also sparked interest in the study of extraterrestrial life and the origins of the solar system. The scientific community is increasingly focused on understanding these rare celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ESA plans to monitor the activity of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun in November 2023. Scientists aim to analyze the comet's composition and behavior to gain insights into the formation of solar systems and the potential building blocks of life.</p>
