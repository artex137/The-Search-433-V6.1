      <h2>Comet C/2025 K1 Atlas breaks into three pieces after close approach to the sun</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1 Atlas has broken into three pieces after passing very close to the sun, with astronomers capturing clear videos and photos of the breakup on the nights of November 11 and 12. The breakup occurred as the comet moved through space, showing a gradual disintegration.</p>

<p>The breakup is significant for scientists studying comets, as it provides insight into the processes that can cause such events. Astronomers plan to continue monitoring the fragments to gather data on their brightness and movement, which may enhance understanding of comet behaviour near the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 Atlas was discovered in May 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet made its close approach to the sun on October 8, 2025.</li>
    <li>The breakup was observed on November 11 and 12, 2025.</li>
    <li>Two main pieces of the comet were found to be approximately 2,000 kilometers apart.</li>
    <li>The images were captured using the Copernicus telescope at the Asiago Observatory in Italy.</li>
    <li>Gianluca Masi from the Virtual Telescope Project recorded the breakup on the same nights.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 Atlas was discovered in May 2025. The comet became brighter over the following months as it approached the sun, creating a coma around it. On October 8, the comet made a close pass to the sun, which weakened its structure.</p>

<p>On November 11 and 12, astronomers captured images showing the comet breaking into three main parts. The clear weather conditions and the high resolution of the telescopes allowed for detailed observations of the event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The clear weather and the telescope’s high resolution helped capture important details of this event,” said Gianluca Masi from the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets often disintegrate when they approach the sun due to the intense heat causing internal ice to turn into gas. This can create pressure that leads to cracking. C/2025 K1 Atlas is believed to have originated from the Kuiper Belt, offering a glimpse into the early Solar System.</p>

<p>This comet is distinct from the interstellar object 3I/Atlas, despite the similarity in names, as both were discovered through the ATLAS sky survey program.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe the three fragments of C/2025 K1 Atlas until they become too faint to see. They aim to study the brightness of each fragment, their separation, changes in the tail, and potential further disintegration.</p>
