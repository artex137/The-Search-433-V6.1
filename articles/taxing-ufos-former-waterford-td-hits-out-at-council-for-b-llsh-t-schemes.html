      <h2>Former TD criticizes Waterford council over city schemes</h2>

<p>Former Waterford TD Matt Shanahan has criticized Waterford City and County Council for introducing what he calls “b*llsh*t” schemes that he claims are damaging the city centre. Shanahan made his remarks on Facebook following an article that discussed calls to remove the toll from the Thomas Francis Meagher Bridge.</p>

<p>Shanahan’s comments reflect growing concerns among local residents and business owners about the impact of council initiatives on the city’s economy. He has suggested that the council should focus on more practical solutions rather than pursuing costly projects that may not benefit the community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>He described the schemes as “killing” the city centre.</li>
    <li>Comments were made in response to calls for toll removal from the Thomas Francis Meagher Bridge.</li>
    <li>Shanahan mentioned that public-private partnerships (PPP) could cost “hundreds of millions” to buy out of contract.</li>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Councillors are better employed to overturn Active Travel BS (b*llsh*t) around the city which is killing shopper and business visits,” Shanahan said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We’ll have a car-free city soon and zero rates and taxes. What budget will pay the corporation engineers and executive then?” he added.</blockquote>
