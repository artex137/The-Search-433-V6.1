      <h2>NASA telescope captures unprecedented images of interstellar comet and identifies complex organic molecules</h2>

<p>The North American space agency has obtained detailed records of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the advanced instruments of the SPHEREx mission. The observations were conducted in December 2025 after the comet emerged from behind Sol, revealing unique features of its structure and composition.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the composition of interstellar objects, with authorities noting the detection of complex organic molecules. Researchers believe this suggests that 3I/ATLAS carries preserved materials from its home star system, enhancing understanding of the distribution of matter in the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS warning system.</li>
    <li>Observations occurred in December 2025 after the comet's closest approach to Sol in October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma, a bright gaseous envelope, has been recorded to exceed 348,000 kilometers in length.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx has operated at 102 different infrared wavelengths to analyze the comet's chemistry.</li>
    <li>Detected elements include water vapor, carbon dioxide, and complex organic molecules.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to cross the Solar System.</li>
    <li>The comet follows a definitive exit trajectory towards deep space.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was initially detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS warning system. Following this, the comet reached its closest point to Sol in October 2025. Observations by the SPHEREx mission took place in December 2025, revealing the complex structure and composition of the comet.</p>

<p>The data collected indicated significant activity, including the sublimation of ices and the release of volatile materials, which are essential for understanding the dynamics of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of complex organic molecules in 3I/ATLAS reinforces the theory that the basic ingredients for life are common in distant molecular clouds,” said a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins ‘Oumuamua and comet Borisov as one of the confirmed interstellar visitors to the Solar System. Its classification as an interstellar object is based on its hyperbolic orbit, which indicates a speed and entry angle incompatible with objects that are gravitationally bound to Sol.</p>

<p>The observations made by SPHEREx are crucial as they validate the importance of space observatories in studying fast-moving objects, providing richer data than ground-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data obtained from the observations will continue to be analyzed in the coming years, supported by additional observations from other instruments. This ongoing research aims to build a more accurate model of the diversity of materials that permeate the galaxy.</p>
