      <h2>Chinese spacecraft sends fascinating GIF of 3I/ATLAS after NASA declines to release photos</h2>

<p>China's Tianwen-1 orbiter has captured an image of the comet 3I/ATLAS during its fly-by of Mars, from October 1 to 4, 2025. The animated GIF showcases the comet streaking across space. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This mission is significant as it enhances understanding of the interstellar anomaly, which some researchers have speculated may have alien origins. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has stated that the successful imaging of 3I/ATLAS contributes to ongoing studies of the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Imaging of 3I/ATLAS by Tianwen-1 orbiter</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> October 1-4, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Fly-by of Mars</li>
    <li><strong>Speed of 3I/ATLAS:</strong> 129,800 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> 10,000 to 100,000 times dimmer than Mars</li>
    <li><strong>Camera Used:</strong> High-Resolution Imaging Camera (HiRIC)</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Imaging:</strong> Captured by European Space Agency's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered, marking it as the third interstellar object recorded in our solar system. On October 2, NASA captured an image of the comet using its HiRISE camera. On October 3, the Tianwen-1 orbiter took a standalone photo of the comet. The animated GIF was compiled from observations made between October 1 and 4.</p>
<p>In September 2025, 3I/ATLAS shifted to the opposite side of the Sun, becoming difficult to observe from Earth. The comet was later photographed by ESA's Mars Express and the ExoMars TGO.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was the first attempt to photograph such a distant and relatively dim target,” the CNSA explained in a statement.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The use of the high-resolution camera carried by the Tianwen-1 orbiter was determined, and key imaging strategies were carefully designed, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the observation,” CNSA reported.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I write to request the release of specific observational data related to 3I/ATLAS, recently captured by NASA missions,” said GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has generated interest due to its unusual characteristics, with researchers like astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggesting it may exhibit non-cometary features. The comet's behavior has led to discussions regarding its potential as an extraterrestrial probe.</p>
<p>NASA has faced criticism for not releasing images of 3I/ATLAS, prompting calls from lawmakers for transparency in data related to interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers at CNSA will continue studying the data collected on 3I/ATLAS to gain further insights. NASA may also review its policies regarding the release of data on interstellar objects following recent public interest and requests from lawmakers.</p>
