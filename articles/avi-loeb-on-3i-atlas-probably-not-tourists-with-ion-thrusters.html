      <h2>Avi Loeb On 3I/ATLAS: 'Probably Not Tourists' With 'Ion-Thrusters'</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has raised concerns that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may not be a typical comet, suggesting its features indicate engineered ion thrusters, rather than a natural phenomenon. Loeb's comments were published on the platform Medium.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges conventional theories about the object. Loeb argues that the behavior of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its jets, is inconsistent with natural cometary activity. He calls for further observations to better understand the object's nature and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Avi Loeb is the head of the Galileo Project.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS exhibits jets that Loeb suggests may act as technological thrusters.</li>
  <li>The nucleus rotates approximately every 16.16 hours.</li>
  <li>Loeb claims that 3I/ATLAS has not shown signs of fragmentation after a close pass around the Sun.</li>
  <li>He estimates that the object would need a surface area of over 1,600 square kilometres to produce the observed jets.</li>
  <li>Radio observations from the MeerKAT telescope detected hydroxyl radicals, indicative of water breakdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has analyzed the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS following its perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun. He noted that despite substantial solar heating, the object remained intact and active, contrary to expectations for typical cometary bodies.</p>
<p>In his analysis, Loeb observed that the jets of 3I/ATLAS maintain a consistent direction over large distances, a behavior he argues is inconsistent with natural outgassing.</p>
<p>Loeb published his findings on Medium, suggesting that the jets may serve as technological thrusters, pointing exhaust toward the Sun for propulsion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The surface area required to account for the mass flow in the large-scale jets ... is untenable,” Loeb stated regarding the physical characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This could be a deliberate post-perihelion manoeuvre ... employed by a spacecraft that aims to gain speed rather than slow down through gravitational assist,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of interstellar objects have often concluded that they are natural phenomena. However, Loeb's hypothesis introduces a new perspective that questions established comet models. Other scientists, including Darryl Seligman from Michigan State University, have expressed skepticism, noting that structural integrity is plausible for larger nuclei.</p>
<p>Additionally, non-gravitational acceleration is often observed in comets, further complicating the analysis of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it progresses on its trajectory. Loeb insists that upcoming observations could either support his thruster hypothesis or align with traditional comet theories.</p>
