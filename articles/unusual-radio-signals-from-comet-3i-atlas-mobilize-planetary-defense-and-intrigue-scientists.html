      <h2>Unusual radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS mobilize planetary defense and intrigue scientists</h2>

<p>The global scientific community has mobilized following the detection of anomalous radio signals from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its passage through the solar system in 2025. The signals, which differ from any previously recorded natural phenomena associated with comets, have prompted Agência Espacial Americana (NASA) to enhance monitoring protocols for similar celestial objects.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the composition and properties of celestial bodies formed in other star systems. Scientists worldwide are now analyzing the data to understand the origin of these signals, which have become one of the biggest enigmas in recent astronomy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in mid-2025 by the ATLAS astronomical survey system.</li>
    <li>The comet approached its closest point to the Sun on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Radio signals were detected at a frequency of 1.6 GHz by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed exceeding 100,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Nasa's Planetary Defense Coordination Office has raised the alert level for monitoring interstellar objects.</li>
    <li>The Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile and the Hubble Space Telescope are part of a global network conducting follow-up observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In mid-2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS survey system. As it approached its perihelion, scientists noted unusual radio emissions. On December 19, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to the Sun, prompting extensive observation campaigns. During this time, the MeerKAT radio telescope captured the anomalous signals, leading to increased scrutiny and analysis by astronomers.</p>

<p>In 2026, scientists have continued to analyze the data collected during the comet's passage, aiming to refine its trajectory and investigate the mysterious emissions further.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The intensity and coherence of the signal suggest a much more efficient emission mechanism than would be expected from a cometary body,” said a spokesperson from NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected in the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike these predecessors, 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual activity that does not fit known cometary models. The detection of its radio signals emphasizes the importance of sky surveillance programs like ATLAS, which serve as Earth's first line of defense against potential asteroid impacts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from comet 3I/ATLAS to determine its chemical and physical composition and to search for complex organic molecules. The ongoing investigation aims to uncover the source of the anomalous radio signals and further our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
