      <h2>Fleet of NASA spacecraft observe interstellar comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>A number of NASA spacecraft across the Solar System have observed the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas during its closest approach to the Sun at the end of October. The observations included data from the Lucy spacecraft, which is currently en route to the Trojan Asteroids, and several orbiters at Mars.</p>

<p>This observation is significant for scientists studying the formation of planetary systems. The data collected from various NASA missions will enhance understanding of the environments and processes that lead to planet assembly around stars. NASA has mobilized multiple spacecraft to gather information about the comet as it exits the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was first spotted in July.</li>
    <li>The comet approached the Sun around late October.</li>
    <li>NASA's Lucy spacecraft observed the comet from 386 million km away.</li>
    <li>Maven and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter both captured images of the comet.</li>
    <li>The Perseverance rover detected a faint smudge of the comet from Mars.</li>
    <li>The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) observed it from 358 million km away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was first detected in July, within the orbit of Jupiter. It passed closer to the Sun in late October, prompting a coordinated observation effort from multiple NASA spacecraft. As the comet moved through the Solar System, it attracted the attention of various space and ground-based observatories.</p>

<p>During this time, NASA's Lucy spacecraft oriented itself carefully to protect its sensitive instruments while capturing images of the comet. The Perseverance rover on Mars was able to record a faint image of the comet as well.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations of 3I/Atlas provide a unique opportunity to study the composition and behavior of a comet from outside our Solar System,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is a fragment from the circumstellar disk of a distant star, originating from the middle disk of the Milky Way. This comet is of particular interest to scientists as it offers insights into the conditions that lead to planetary formation. Previous studies of comets have helped to illuminate the processes involved in the assembly of planets around stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas exits the Solar System, data collected from the various observations will be analyzed to further understand its composition and the implications for planetary science. Future studies may focus on the results from spectroscopy, photometry, and orbital mechanics conducted by both space and ground-based observatories.</p>
