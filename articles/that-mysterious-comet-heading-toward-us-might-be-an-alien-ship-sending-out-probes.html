      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Exhibits Unusual Behavior, Sparks Theories of Alien Probes</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed displaying peculiar behavior as it approaches the inner solar system, with scientists and theorists alike speculating about its nature. Astronomers have noted changes in its brightness and color, leading to discussions about its potential origins and implications for space exploration. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Mars in July 2024, where it will come within 1.6 million miles of the planet.</p>

<p>This situation has garnered significant attention due to the comet's unusual characteristics, which have prompted both scientific inquiry and speculative theories. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS could potentially be a "technological object" capable of deploying mini probes to Earth. Observations from the Gemini South telescope in Chile have confirmed that the comet is developing a tail, supporting the idea that it is indeed a comet, albeit an unusual one.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be up to <strong>28.5 miles</strong> wide.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass within <strong>1.6 million miles</strong> of Mars in July 2024.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate that 3I/ATLAS is growing a tail, confirming its status as a comet.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has proposed that the comet could be a "technological object" potentially releasing probes.</li>
    <li>Loeb has requested NASA to observe the comet with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Juno probe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation since its discovery, with reports of its unusual behavior emerging in recent months. Initial observations indicated changes in brightness and color, prompting further study.</p>
<p>In June 2024, the comet is expected to approach Mars, which has led to calls for enhanced observation efforts from NASA.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS is a technological object, it could either visit us itself or release mini probes that arrive on Earth and appear as unidentified aerial phenomena,” said Avi Loeb during an interview with the Sol Foundation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of several interstellar objects that have captured the attention of scientists and the public. Previous interstellar objects have also led to discussions about their origins and potential implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, scientists will continue to monitor its behavior and trajectory. NASA's response to Loeb's request for observation will determine the level of scrutiny the comet receives during its flyby.</p>
