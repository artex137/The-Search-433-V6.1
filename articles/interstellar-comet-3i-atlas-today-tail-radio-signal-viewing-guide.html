      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Survives Close Pass of the Sun</h2>

<p>On 15 November 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has successfully survived its close approach to the Sun, developed a prominent ion tail, and emitted its first detected radio signal. The comet is currently located in the constellation Virgo, approximately 2.1 AU from Earth, with no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Authorities and scientists are using data from spacecraft and telescopes to monitor the comet's trajectory and behavior, dismissing recent online speculation about its origins as unfounded.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 15 November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> 1 July 2025, by NASA-funded ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> 29–30 October 2025, at approximately 1.36–1.4 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025, at about 1.8 AU (≈270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Current location:</strong> Constellation Virgo, approximately 2.1 AU from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 150,000 mph (≈246,000 km/h)</li>
    <li><strong>Radio signal detected:</strong> Emission from hydroxyl (OH) radicals</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first reported on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS system. It made its closest approach to the Sun between 29 and 30 October 2025. Following this perihelion, the comet emerged intact, displaying a bright blue-green coma and a dusty tail.</p>
<p>On 14 November 2025, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced improved predictions of the comet’s position using data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which had observed the comet from about 29 million km away.</p>
<p>On the same day, astronomers detected the first radio signal from 3I/ATLAS using the MeerKAT radio telescope, confirming its status as a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The radio detection confirms that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, not an alien probe,” NASA stated in a newly published FAQ page.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The observed accelerations can be explained by ordinary outgassing of CO and CO₂ from a small fraction of the surface,” researcher Florian Neukart noted in a recent study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is the third interstellar object identified, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous observations of other comets have shown similar behaviors, but 3I/ATLAS's unique composition and trajectory have sparked ongoing discussions about its origins.</p>
<p>Despite speculation about its being an engineered object, recent data has reinforced the view that it is a natural comet, consistent with characteristics observed in other comets within our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves further from the Sun, with a focus on its behavior and characteristics. Observatories will refine their observations based on improved positional predictions from the ESA and NASA.</p>
