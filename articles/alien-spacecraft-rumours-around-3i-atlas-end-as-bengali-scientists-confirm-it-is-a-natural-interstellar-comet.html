      <h2>Alien Spacecraft Rumours Around 3I/ATLAS End as Bengali Scientists Confirm It Is a Natural Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>On January 2, 2026, a team of Bengali scientists confirmed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, dispelling widespread rumours that it could be an alien spacecraft. The scientists conducted their research using India’s upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in Pune.</p>

<p>This confirmation addresses significant public curiosity and speculation surrounding 3I/ATLAS since its detection on July 1, 2025, by astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The findings have been published in the Astronomer’s Telegram, marking a critical step in understanding interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Date of publication: January 2, 2026</li>
  <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
  <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million km)</li>
  <li>Detection dates: December 17 and 19, 2025</li>
  <li>Significance of detection: greater than 10σ</li>
  <li>Flux densities recorded: 3.86 ± 0.38 millijanskys on December 17 and 0.81 ± 0.05 millijanskys on December 19</li>
  <li>Team members: Dr. Sabyasachi Pal, Mr. Arijit Manna, Dr. Tapas Bag</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS. Following this, speculation about its nature began to circulate widely, with some suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa reported its first radio detection of 3I/ATLAS. The comet reached its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, when the Bengali scientists conducted their observations using the uGMRT.</p>
<p>Observations on December 17 and 19 confirmed its natural cometary behavior, while a subsequent observation on December 21 showed no detection, indicating a change in the comet's brightness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “If an object were artificial or technological in nature, its radio emission would be expected to show specific patterns, signals, or anomalous features. These observations clearly demonstrate that the radio emission from 3I/ATLAS is entirely consistent with natural cometary behaviour,” said Dr. Sabyasachi Pal, the team leader.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “This research not only dispels misconceptions about 3I/ATLAS but also opens a new window for understanding future interstellar objects,” Dr. Pal added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Previous studies have shown that there is no scientific evidence of life beyond Earth, yet speculation about extraterrestrial life continues to capture public interest.</p>
<p>NASA has previously stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, remaining at a safe distance of at least 1.6 astronomical units (about 240 million km).</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future research will focus on spectral line diagnostics and further observations to better understand the emission processes of 3I/ATLAS. Scientists aim to conduct multi-epoch radio monitoring and coordinated campaigns for upcoming interstellar objects.</p>
