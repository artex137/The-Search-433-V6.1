      <h2>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) Falls Apart After Surviving Close Pass by the Sun</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) breaking apart as it moves away from the Sun, with images documenting its disintegration from November 11 to December 6, 2025. The comet, which was initially discovered in May 2025, has faded significantly and is now extremely faint, suggesting little of its original nucleus remains intact.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides insight into the life cycle of long-period comets. Scientists are closely analyzing the breakup to enhance understanding of cometary structures and behaviors when subjected to solar heating. The observations may help refine models of comet evolution and survival.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> May 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 8, 2025, passing within 49 million kilometers of the Sun.</li>
    <li><strong>First fragmentation detected:</strong> November 11, 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple fragments visible:</strong> December 6, 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>Current magnitude:</strong> Approximately 27.17 as of February 2, 2026.</li>
    <li><strong>Observation tools:</strong> Gemini North telescope and amateur telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered in May 2025. It reached perihelion on October 8, 2025, where it survived intense solar heating, brightening to magnitude 9. On November 11, astronomers first detected signs of fragmentation. By December 6, high-resolution images from the Gemini North telescope revealed multiple fragments within their own dust envelopes. As of early February 2026, the comet had faded to a magnitude of approximately 27.17.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The breakup of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) provides a valuable case study in cometary evolution,” said an astronomer involved in the observations. “The detailed sequence of observations captures multiple stages of disintegration rarely documented so clearly.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This breakup aligns with modern models that describe comet nuclei as loose mixtures of ice, dust, and rock. Such structures are known to be mechanically weak and porous. Previous observations of cometary breakups have helped refine scientific understanding of how these celestial bodies behave when they enter the inner Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to analyze the data collected during the comet's disintegration to improve models of comet survival and evolution. Further observation of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is unlikely due to its extreme faintness.</p>
