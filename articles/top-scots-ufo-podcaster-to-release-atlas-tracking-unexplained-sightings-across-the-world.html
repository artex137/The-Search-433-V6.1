      <h2>Top Scots UFO podcaster to release atlas tracking unexplained sightings across the world</h2>

<p>Andy Mcgrillen, a prominent UFO podcaster, is set to release an atlas documenting unexplained sightings globally. The launch of the Atlas of Unidentified Flying Objects will take place at Thomas Tosh in Thornhill, Dumfries and Galloway, on September 18, just days after US Congress hearings on the subject.</p>

<p>This release matters as it aims to raise awareness about UFOs and hold lawmakers accountable. Mcgrillen, host of That UFO Podcast, which has been downloaded over five million times, emphasizes the need for continued public interest in the topic. He hopes the atlas will encourage further investigation into lesser-known cases.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Launch date: September 18</li>
    <li>Location: Thomas Tosh, Thornhill, Dumfries and Galloway</li>
    <li>Podcast downloads: Over five million</li>
    <li>Time of launch event: 7:30 PM</li>
    <li>Publisher: Ivy Press</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Andy Mcgrillen's interest in UFOs began in the mid-1990s after a sighting while leaving a Boys’ Brigade meeting in Glasgow. He recalls seeing a “huge spinning string of lights.” Since then, he has developed a passion for the subject, culminating in the creation of his podcast and the upcoming atlas.</p>
<p>The atlas includes various elements such as crash retrieval, abduction cases, and military encounters. It features specially commissioned maps, detailed case studies, photographs, and direct witness testimonies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These are important to hold lawmakers and policy makers’ feet to the fire and keep the topic uncomfortably visible for those who would try and keep the truth hidden from the public,” Mcgrillen said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This book for me is one I’d want to read myself. It’s an introduction to cases from around the world. Some well-known, others less so,” he added. “I’d love for someone to pick it up, find a case they had never heard of before and have it stir something in them to go investigate further.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Mcgrillen's work comes amid a growing global interest in UFO phenomena, particularly in light of recent US Congressional hearings. The atlas aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse regarding unidentified flying objects and their implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The atlas launch will take place on September 18, with tickets available for purchase at Thomas Tosh or through the shop's website. Mcgrillen hopes the book will inspire further exploration into the subject of UFOs.</p>
