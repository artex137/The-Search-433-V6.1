      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-19 09:56 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth on December 19, 2025</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth at approximately 1 a.m. EST (06:00 GMT), offering a unique opportunity for skywatchers to observe this celestial event. The comet will pass at a distance of about 168 million miles (270 million km), which poses no risk of impact, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>This event is significant because 3I/ATLAS is one of only a few confirmed interstellar objects to enter our solar system, providing scientists with a rare chance to study material from beyond our own star system. Authorities and amateur astronomers are preparing to observe the comet, which is located in the constellation Leo, near the star Regulus.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach Time:</strong> 1 a.m. EST (06:00 GMT)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Distance:</strong> 168 million miles (270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Constellation Leo, near Regulus</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Recommendation:</strong> Telescope recommended; not visible to the naked eye</li>
    <li><strong>Other Events:</strong> New Moon phase and Ursid meteor shower peak approaching</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>December 19, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches its closest approach to Earth early in the morning. Observers are encouraged to use telescopes or binoculars to view the comet, as it is not bright enough to be seen without aid.</p>
<p>The New Moon phase coincides with this event, occurring at 1:43 UTC on December 20 (7:43 p.m. CST on December 19), which will enhance visibility for skywatchers by minimizing moonlight interference.</p>
<p>The Ursid meteor shower peaks on the night of December 21 into December 22, 2025, providing additional celestial viewing opportunities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS formed elsewhere in the galaxy and is only passing through—meaning this is a one-time opportunity for observers and researchers alike,” said a spokesperson from the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Tonight’s sky offers minimal moonlight, making it ideal for spotting faint objects like the comet and the Ursids,” noted an EarthSky representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare visitors to our solar system. Most comets originate from the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud. The arrival of 3I/ATLAS marks a significant occasion for both amateur and professional astronomers, as it presents a chance to study material that has traveled from another star system.</p>
<p>Additionally, the December solstice is approaching on December 21, 2025, which will bring longer nights, enhancing opportunities for night sky observation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to prepare for the best viewing conditions by locating the comet in the constellation Leo during the pre-dawn hours. Observations of the Ursid meteor shower will continue through December 26, 2025, providing further opportunities for stargazing.</p>
