      <h2>NASA-backed ATLAS system uncovers new interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, setting stage for 2025 observations</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected a new interstellar comet, tentatively named 3I/ATLAS, using the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The discovery was made recently, and preparations are underway for an observational campaign in 2025. The comet's unusual trajectory confirms its origin from outside the solar system, making it a significant target for astronomical study.</p>

<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS is important because it provides a rare opportunity to examine celestial materials from beyond our solar system. This comet could offer insights into the building blocks of distant planetary systems. The scientific community is mobilizing resources for detailed observations, including spectroscopic analysis and mapping its trajectory as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS confirmed as interstellar by ATLAS as of October 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun expected in mid-2025.</li>
    <li>ATLAS, a NASA-funded project, operates primarily from Hawaii.</li>
    <li>Collaboration includes the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope for detailed imaging.</li>
    <li>Public outreach events planned to engage amateur astronomers.</li>
    <li>Observations will focus on its elemental composition and activity levels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Initial detection of 3I/ATLAS occurred through ATLAS's automated systems, which flagged the comet due to its high velocity and unusual orbital parameters. Following this, multiple ground-based observatories confirmed the object’s interstellar nature.</p>

<p>As part of the observational campaign, astronomers have outlined goals for studying the comet's trajectory and composition, with significant activities planned for mid-2025 when it reaches its peak brightness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I/ATLAS highlights the importance of wide-field surveys in identifying rare astronomical events,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This comet offers a unique glimpse into the processes of planet formation in other star systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS are exceedingly rare. Prior known interstellar objects include ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, each presenting unique characteristics. The study of 3I/ATLAS will contribute to a broader understanding of such celestial phenomena.</p>

<p>NASA's investment in ATLAS underlines its dual focus on identifying potential Earth hazards and enhancing cosmic knowledge through ongoing research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and activity. The collaborative observational efforts aim to gather and analyze data to deepen understanding of its composition and origins, with activities ramping up as the comet nears its closest approach in 2025.</p>
