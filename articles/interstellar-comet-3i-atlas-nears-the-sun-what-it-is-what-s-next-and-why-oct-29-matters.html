      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS nears the Sun: what it is, what’s next, and why Oct. 29 matters</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching its closest point to the Sun, set for October 29–30, 2025. The comet is currently obscured by the Sun's glare and cannot be observed from Earth, according to the latest updates from NASA and other space agencies.</p>

<p>This event is significant for scientists as multiple spacecraft are preparing to observe the comet during its perihelion. The comet is expected to become visible again in early December, allowing for further study of its characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> October 29–30, 2025 (UTC)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest distance to the Sun:</strong> approximately 1.35–1.4 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> third confirmed interstellar object</li>
    <li><strong>Current status:</strong> in solar conjunction, not visible</li>
    <li><strong>Expected reappearance:</strong> early December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. It follows a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its interstellar origin. The comet is currently in solar conjunction, making it invisible from Earth.</p>
<p>On October 29–30, the comet will reach perihelion, coming within 1.35–1.4 AU of the Sun. Following this, it is expected to reappear in the dawn skies by early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a scientific opportunity, not a threat,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “Its trajectory keeps it at safe distances from Earth.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We anticipate significant observations from our spacecraft as the comet approaches perihelion,” noted a representative from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike typical short-period comets, 3I/ATLAS will not return after this pass. Its trajectory does not intersect with Earth’s orbit, ensuring no risk of collision.</p>
<p>Scientists are particularly interested in the comet's chemical composition, which may provide insights into the formation of icy bodies in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches perihelion, various space missions will attempt to gather data on its outgassing and dust dynamics. Observations will continue after the comet becomes visible again in December, with updates expected as new data becomes available.</p>
