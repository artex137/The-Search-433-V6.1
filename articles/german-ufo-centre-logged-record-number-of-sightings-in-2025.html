      <h2>German UFO centre logs record number of sightings in 2025</h2>

<p>The UFO reporting centre CENAP in Lützelbach, Germany, has recorded a record number of UFO sightings in 2025, as confirmed by its director Hansjürgen Köhler on Monday. The centre received 1,348 reports from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and a few from other countries. There have been no injuries or fatalities reported in connection with these sightings.</p>

<p>This increase in reported sightings has prompted CENAP to continue its mission of providing scientific explanations for unidentified flying objects. Köhler stated that while the number of reports has risen steadily since 2019, most of the sightings can be attributed to natural phenomena rather than extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1,348</strong> UFO sightings recorded in 2025.</li>
    <li>Reports came from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and other countries.</li>
    <li>Major contributors to sightings include planets, stars, and meteors.</li>
    <li>Over <strong>120</strong> sightings of Elon Musk's Starlink satellites reported.</li>
    <li>Increase in reports of drone activity noted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2019, CENAP began to see a steady increase in UFO sightings reported by the public. Each subsequent year has shown a rise in these reports, culminating in the record number logged in 2025. The centre has actively worked to identify and explain these sightings through its scientific approach.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, CENAP has received numerous reports attributing sightings to bright planets like Venus and Jupiter, as well as the star Sirius. Additionally, many early morning observers have reported meteors, which have contributed to the confusion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Most of these sightings can be explained by bright planets or meteors,” said Köhler. “Even last year, there were no alien spaceships among them.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Reports that can be identified as drone flights have been increasing for five years,” Köhler added, noting the rise of both private and industrial drones.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>CENAP, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Sky Phenomena, has served as a point of contact for individuals seeking scientific explanations for UFO sightings since its inception. The centre has seen a significant increase in reports over the years, with phenomena such as rocket stage re-starts and space debris also contributing to the sightings.</p>
<p>The trend of rising sightings reflects a growing public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena, though experts consistently emphasize that most sightings have terrestrial explanations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>CENAP will continue its investigations into the reported sightings, aiming to provide clarity on the nature of these phenomena. The centre is expected to release further findings and analyses as more reports are collected throughout the year.</p>
