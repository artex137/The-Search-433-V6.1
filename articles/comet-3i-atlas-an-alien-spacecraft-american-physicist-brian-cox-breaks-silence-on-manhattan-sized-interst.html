      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS an alien spacecraft? American physicist Brian Cox breaks silence on Manhattan-sized interstellar object</h2>

<p>American physicist Brian Cox has dismissed claims that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is an “alien spacecraft,” calling such theories “drivel.” Cox made his comments in response to growing speculation surrounding the comet, which was first detected on July 1, 2023, by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</p>

<p>Cox's remarks come amid a surge of conspiracy theories fueled by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who has suggested that 3I/ATLAS may be an artificial object. Cox has urged the public to rely on credible sources for information about the comet, emphasizing its natural origins and expected behavior as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Nasa identified it as the third known interstellar object entering our solar system.</li>
    <li>The object will pass no closer than 170 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>It measures approximately the size of New York.</li>
    <li>Its orbit indicates it will only pass through the solar system once.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, NASA’s ATLAS detected 3I/ATLAS, classifying it as an interstellar object due to its distinct orbital path. The comet's unusual characteristics, including color changes and jets, have attracted scientific attention. As speculation grew, Cox publicly addressed the theories in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, emphasizing the comet's natural composition.</p>

<p>In his post, Cox stated, “Just to be clear – given recent drivel online – Comet 3I/ATLAS is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff.” He reassured the public that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If it ever encounters another inhabited solar system in the far future I hope the living things there are more sensible than us and enjoy it for what it is – a visitor from elsewhere in the galaxy.” - Brian Cox</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That means it’s most likely natural, but it’s still a high enough probability that we should take it seriously.” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior discussions surrounding interstellar objects have often included theories of artificial origins, particularly following the discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017. The interest in 3I/ATLAS has reignited debates about the existence of extraterrestrial technology. Cox's firm stance against these theories reflects a broader scientific consensus that emphasizes natural explanations for such cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, scientists will monitor its trajectory and behavior. Ongoing research aims to gather more data about the comet, further informing our understanding of interstellar objects. There are no immediate investigations or charges related to the claims surrounding the comet.</p>
