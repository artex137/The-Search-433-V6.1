      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could help protect Earth from dangerous asteroids</h2>

<p>A newly discovered interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, poses no threat to Earth but will be closely observed by a NASA-coordinated group to improve monitoring of potential hazardous objects. The comet is expected to fly deeper into the solar system before leaving between November 27, 2025, and January 27, 2026.</p>

<p>This observation campaign is significant as it aims to enhance our ability to predict and track comets and asteroids that could threaten Earth. The International Asteroid Warning Network has initiated this project, which will also serve as a training ground for astronomers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object in our solar system.</li>
    <li>It will reach a closest distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units from Earth.</li>
    <li>The observation campaign will commence this month, with citizen scientists invited to participate.</li>
    <li>A workshop is scheduled for November 10, 2025.</li>
    <li>The International Asteroid Warning Network was formed following United Nations recommendations.</li>
    <li>Nasa continues to monitor space objects despite the ongoing government shutdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 21, 2025, the Minor Planet Center announced the observation campaign for comet 3I/ATLAS. The campaign aims to track the comet's speed and motion relative to stars. The project will help refine techniques for predicting the orbits of other potential threats to Earth.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to be observed by Mars and Jupiter probes as it approaches the sun. The observation period will include workshops and teleconferences for participants.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The campaign will target comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) to exercise the capability of the observing community to extract accurate astrometry,”</blockquote> said a notice from the Minor Planet Center.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network is a worldwide collaboration formed to address the near-Earth object impact threat. It operates under recommendations from the United Nations and its space mission planning advisory group. NASA has been actively searching for potentially hazardous objects for decades, and so far, no imminent threats have been identified.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The observation campaign will proceed as planned, with workshops and periodic teleconferences to facilitate participation. The next steps will focus on tracking comet 3I/ATLAS and improving techniques for monitoring future space objects.</p>
