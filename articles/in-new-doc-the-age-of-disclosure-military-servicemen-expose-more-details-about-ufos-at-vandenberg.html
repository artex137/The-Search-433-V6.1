      <h2>In New Doc ‘The Age of Disclosure,’ Military Servicemen Expose More Details About UFOs at Vandenberg</h2>

<p>Former military servicemen have revealed new details about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) sightings at Vandenberg Space Force Base in Lompoc, California, in the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, released in 2025. The film features testimonies from military insiders who claim these encounters occurred frequently between 2003 and 2005, with no reported injuries or fatalities. The documentary highlights a series of incidents that have raised questions about national security and government transparency regarding UAPs.</p>

<p>The revelations in the documentary have prompted renewed interest in UAP investigations by U.S. authorities. According to the film, the federal government has allegedly spent 80 years attempting to cover up the existence of non-human life. The U.S. government officially acknowledged the existence of UAPs in 2017, leading to increased scrutiny and the establishment of a new NASA task force to investigate these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: <em>The Age of Disclosure</em></li>
    <li>Location: Vandenberg Space Force Base, Lompoc, California</li>
    <li>Timeframe of incidents: 2003 to 2005</li>
    <li>Number of reported UAP incidents: Five</li>
    <li>Key witness: Jeffrey Nuccetelli, former military police officer</li>
    <li>Notable sightings: A glowing red square and a pulsing sphere of light</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Numerous UAP sightings have been reported at Vandenberg Space Force Base as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>**October 14, 2003**: Three Boeing contractors reported a massive glowing red square hovering silently over missile defense sites.</li>
    <li>**October 14, 2003**: Security guards reported a fast-moving object over the ocean, leading to chaos among personnel.</li>
    <li>**2004**: Witnesses reported another light behaving erratically over the ocean, initially thought to be an enemy aircraft.</li>
    <li>**2005**: A large rectangular craft, larger than a C-130, was sighted over the base.</li>
    <li>**2005**: Nuccetelli and two other officers witnessed a pulsing light over the ocean that behaved unusually.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’m here today because the American people have both the right and responsibility to know the truth about unidentified aerial phenomena,” said Jeffrey Nuccetelli during a House Oversight Committee hearing in September.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It was a 30-foot diameter sphere of light,” Nuccetelli described. “My friends and I watched it for a moment and then it gently accelerated, and traveled up and disappeared into the stars.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since 2017, UAP sightings have gained attention following government acknowledgment of their existence. High-ranking military officials have begun sharing their experiences, leading to the release of Pentagon reports and the exposure of secret government programs aimed at tracking UAP encounters. The documentary features testimonies from various military personnel, quantum physicists, and directors of covert programs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The U.S. government continues to investigate UAP incidents, with ongoing efforts to declassify information related to these sightings. The newly formed NASA task force is expected to play a significant role in future research and analysis of UAP encounters.</p>
