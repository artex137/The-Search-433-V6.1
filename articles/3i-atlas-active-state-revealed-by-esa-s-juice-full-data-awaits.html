      <h2>3I/ATLAS 'Active State' Revealed By ESA's Juice — Full Data Awaits</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency's (ESA) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) has captured a preliminary image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a close encounter on 4 November 2025, approximately 66 million kilometres from the spacecraft. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities from this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This encounter marks a significant opportunity for astronomers to study 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object ever discovered. The comet, first spotted on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope network, is currently on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not bound to the Sun. The Juice mission, launched in 2023, is on an eight-year journey to Jupiter, with its primary objective to explore the gas giant's icy moons.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Juice's closest approach to 3I/ATLAS occurred on 4 November 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its perihelion on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Data from five scientific instruments will be received on 18 and 20 February 2026.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has an estimated orbital eccentricity of 6.139.</li>
    <li>The closest distance to Juice was approximately 66 million km.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS telescope network. Following its discovery, Juice made a close approach to the comet on 4 November 2025, shortly after 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun on 29 October 2025. This timing allowed for optimal observations of the comet's active state.</p>

<p>During November 2025, Juice used five of its scientific instruments to gather data on 3I/ATLAS. The transmission of full scientific data is set to occur on 18 and 20 February 2026, as the spacecraft manages data transmission while protecting its sensitive equipment.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The initial image confirmed that the comet was brightly visible and surrounded by signs of activity,” said a member of the Juice team. “The visibility of the plasma and dust tails indicates that we have caught the object during peak outgassing.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS represents a rare opportunity for scientists to study an object from outside our Solar System. Its high orbital eccentricity confirms that it is on a hyperbolic path, further emphasizing its interstellar nature. The Juice mission aims to provide insights into the composition and behavior of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Juice team will await the comprehensive data from the five scientific instruments, which will provide critical information about the comet's composition and activity. This data is expected to enhance our understanding of planetary formation and the chemistry of other star systems.</p>
