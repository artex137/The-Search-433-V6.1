      <h2>NASA cuts ISS livestream after strange object appears on camera, sparking UFO questions online</h2>

<p>NASA has briefly switched its International Space Station (ISS) livestream to a “signal loss” slate after a small bright object crossed the frame on <strong>October 13, 2023</strong>. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident has reignited discussions about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) among viewers. NASA has not yet issued a specific statement regarding this clip. Historically, the agency has explained that these cutaways are automatic when the ISS drops out of relay satellite coverage or when controllers switch cameras, which occurs multiple times daily.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: October 13, 2023</li>
    <li>Time of object appearance: approximately 11:04 a.m. US Central Time</li>
    <li>Location: International Space Station</li>
    <li>Agency: NASA</li>
    <li>Previous High Definition Earth Viewing (HDEV) end date: August 22, 2019</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 13, 2023, viewers of the ISS livestream observed a bright object near the Earth's limb. Shortly after, the stream switched to a “no signal” slate. A Reddit user noted that the object appeared around 11:04 a.m. US Central Time. This prompted speculation about the nature of the object and the timing of the cutaway.</p>

<p>NASA’s video feed operates through the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS). When the ISS loses coverage or when camera sources are switched, the livestream automatically reverts to a blue screen or preset slate. This behavior is common and expected.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The station regularly passes out of range of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites used to send and receive video, voice and telemetry from the station,” said NASA spokesperson Daniel Huot in a CBS News report dated July 14, 2016.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Whenever we lose signal, the cameras will show a blue screen or a preset video slate,” Huot added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Past incidents have shown a pattern where bright objects appear just before the livestream cuts to a slate. NASA has previously clarified that these occurrences are coincidental and not indicative of deliberate censorship. The High Definition Earth Viewing experiment ended on August 22, 2019, and the current external cameras exhibit similar behavior during signal interruptions.</p>

<p>Common explanations for bright objects include meteors, satellites, or reflections from the ISS or Earth. NASA has stated that reflections from the station's windows and other artifacts are routine in video feeds from the ISS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa has not disclosed any ongoing investigations or next steps regarding the recent livestream incident. The agency continues to study unusual sightings with an emphasis on data rather than speculation.</p>
