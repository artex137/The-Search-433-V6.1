      <h2>Astronomers and students capture growing tail of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during observing program</h2>

<p>Astronomers and students have captured a new image of the growing tail of interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS through an educational initiative. The observations, made recently, show a prominent tail and glowing coma from this rare celestial visitor.</p>

<p>This project highlights the collaboration between professionals and students, allowing for hands-on experience in astronomy. The data collected includes new scientific measurements of the comet's colors and composition, which are significant for understanding interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>The observations provided insights into the comet's tail and coma.</li>
    <li>New scientific measurements of the comet's colors and composition have been obtained.</li>
    <li>The initiative involves collaboration between astronomers and students.</li>
    <li>The specific date and location of the observations have not been disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers and students have been engaged in this educational initiative, which has facilitated the observation of Comet 3I/ATLAS. The growing tail and coma were documented in the recent imaging, marking a significant moment in their research efforts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The collaboration has allowed students to gain valuable experience while contributing to real scientific research," said a spokesperson for the initiative.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is a rare interstellar object that has drawn attention from the scientific community. Previous observations of interstellar comets have contributed to understanding the composition and behavior of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the data collected is expected, which may lead to more insights into the nature of Comet 3I/ATLAS and similar interstellar objects.</p>
