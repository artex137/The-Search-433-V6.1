      <h2>News across North Carolina: A UFO, earthquakes and international students</h2>

<p>A North Carolina resident has reported seeing a fireball in the sky, while the state has also experienced a series of small earthquakes, and international student enrollment is showing mixed results across local universities. The incidents were reported over the past week in various locations in the state.</p>

<p>Authorities are monitoring the situations, particularly the earthquakes, which have raised concerns among residents. Meanwhile, universities are analyzing international student enrollment trends following recent changes in immigration policy. The impacts of these changes are still unclear.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of fireball sighting: September 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of fireball: Lawndale, Cleveland County</li>
    <li>Magnitude of recent earthquakes: Ranged from 1.7 to 2.2</li>
    <li>Number of earthquakes in Rosman this year: 11</li>
    <li>International students at Duke University: 28% of total enrollment</li>
    <li>International students at NC State University: 3,585 (down 6.5%)</li>
    <li>International students at UNC Charlotte: 1,683 (down 17%)</li>
    <li>International students at UNC-Chapel Hill: Over 1,180 (up 11.5%)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 21, 2025, a resident identified as Thomas A. reported a fireball in the sky in Lawndale. Kelsey K. also witnessed the event while driving. Reports indicated that the fireball was likely a result of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch.</p>

<p>On September 21, at 12:46 a.m., a 1.7 magnitude earthquake occurred near Rosman, marking the 11th earthquake in the area for the year. No damage or injuries were reported. A second earthquake, measuring 2.2 in magnitude, struck near Rosman at 5:12 a.m. on the same day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, enrollment data for international students at North Carolina universities has emerged, revealing varying trends. Duke University reported that international students make up 28% of its total enrollment, while NC State University saw a decrease of about 150 international students compared to last year.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are getting the early sense that institutions are facing an array of scenarios this fall, without any striking trends," said Clay Harmon, executive director of the Association of International Enrollment Management.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>North Carolina has seen fluctuations in international student enrollment due to recent immigration policies. Duke University has historically had the highest international enrollment in the state, while NC State University has consistently ranked second. The mixed results this year reflect broader trends affecting universities nationwide.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor seismic activity in the Rosman area. Universities are expected to analyze further enrollment data as the semester progresses, while discussions about immigration policy and its effects on international students are likely to continue.</p>
