      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS shows accurate trajectory to Jupiter’s hill radius in 2026</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, discovered in 2025, is predicted to encounter Jupiter on March 16, 2026, at a distance that coincides with the planet’s radius, according to recent findings. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This trajectory is significant as it challenges conventional explanations for natural comets and asteroids. Researchers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS due to its unique characteristics, including its chemical composition and dynamic behavior. The object’s unusual features suggest it may not originate from typical interstellar material, raising questions about its formation and journey through space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: 2025</li>
    <li>Encounter date: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Expected distance to perijove: 53,445 million km</li>
    <li>Radius of Jupiter’s Hill: 53.502 million km</li>
    <li>Margin of error: ±0.06 million km</li>
    <li>Mass: Up to a million times that of 1I/’Oumuamua</li>
    <li>Observatories are continuously monitoring 3I/ATLAS until the rendezvous.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed since its discovery in 2025. Between July and November 2025, researchers detected a jet directed towards the Sun, which differs from typical comet tails. The object is expected to remain invisible from Earth during perihelion, limiting detailed observations.</p>

<p>As the encounter date approaches, further imaging and spectral data will be collected to learn more about its composition and behavior. The object’s trajectory has been adjusted due to detected non-gravitational acceleration near perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS suggest it may not be a typical interstellar object,” a representative from the research team stated. “We are eager to gather more data as it approaches Jupiter.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS surpasses the two previously confirmed interstellar objects, 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, in scale and mass. Its unprecedented features, such as extreme negative polarization and a jet that may protect it from micrometeorite impacts, have drawn significant interest from the scientific community.</p>

<p>The unusual nickel-cyanide ratio found in its gas column further distinguishes it from known solar comets, indicating a potential industrial origin for some of its materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely in the coming months, collecting images and spectral data to further investigate its unique properties and trajectory as it approaches Jupiter.</p>
