      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Expert Avi Loeb Flags Strange Sunward Alignment Anomaly</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, offering a rare glimpse of the interstellar object before it disappears into space. Discovered in July 2025, 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, and it is currently traveling at speeds exceeding 241,000 kilometres per hour (150,000 mph).</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS has sparked a debate within the scientific community. While most astronomers classify it as a unique interstellar comet, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb raises concerns about its unusual characteristics, suggesting they may indicate something more than a natural phenomenon. Observatories worldwide are preparing to study the object closely during its upcoming perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>Current speed exceeds 241,000 km/h (150,000 mph).</li>
    <li>Alignment anomaly detected within eight degrees of rotation axis.</li>
    <li>Probability of specific alignment occurring by chance is 0.5 percent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. Between July and September, astronomers using the Two-meter Twin Telescope in Tenerife observed a 'wobbling high-altitude jet' from the comet's nucleus. The object is set to reach its perihelion on 29 October 2025, where further observations may provide insights into its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "If not for that special alignment, the anti-tail jet towards the Sun would have been oriented at a much larger angle."</blockquote> 

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community remains divided over the nature of 3I/ATLAS. While some experts, including astrophysicist Brian Cox, argue that it is a natural comet, they acknowledge that its data is unique and warrants further investigation. Loeb's list of anomalies includes its trajectory, which aligns closely with the solar system's orbital plane, and unusual concentrations of materials detected by NASA's Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories around the globe are preparing for the close approach of 3I/ATLAS on 19 December 2025. Researchers aim to capture its spectroscopic signature to determine whether it is a natural object or indicative of a more complex origin.</p>
