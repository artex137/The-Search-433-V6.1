      <h2>Visitor From Stars: Astonishing Journey Of Interstellar Comet 3I ATLAS</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, has garnered attention as only the third interstellar object ever observed in our solar system. This rare cosmic wanderer is moving at approximately 60 km/s (≈ 137,000 mph) relative to the Sun, and its trajectory suggests it will exit our solar system, raising questions about its origins and composition.</p>

<p>Scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS due to its unique characteristics, including its hyperbolic orbit and unusual activity, which could provide insights into the formation of star systems and the distribution of life-building materials across the galaxy. Observations from various telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, aim to gather data before the comet leaves our vicinity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of discovery:</strong> Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 60 km/s (≈ 137,000 mph)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> 29 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Size estimates:</strong> Initially suggested ~10 km, later refined to a few km or less</li>
    <li><strong>Activity:</strong> Detected jets, outgassing, and a developing tail and coma</li>
    <li><strong>Observatories involved:</strong> James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, Mars orbiters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope. Follow-up observations confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originated from another star system. The comet approached its closest point to the Sun on 29 October 2025, during which its activity increased markedly.</p>

<p>Throughout its journey, astronomers have observed unusual behaviors, including jets of material ejected toward the Sun and water-derived vapour emissions at distances typically not conducive to sublimation. As it nears its exit from our solar system, telescopes are racing to gather final data on this unique visitor.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS offers a nearly unique chance to examine material formed in a different planetary system,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Studying such objects can help refine our models of cosmic dust and ice chemistry.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in our solar system, following 2I/Borisov in 2019 and 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirms it did not originate in our solar system, and its unusual activity challenges existing comet models, prompting discussions about the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS recedes from our solar system, scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from various telescopes. This opportunity to study the comet will not return, making it a critical moment for understanding interstellar objects.</p>
