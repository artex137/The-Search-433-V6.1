      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Astrophysicist Adam Frank Takes A Dig At Harvard Scientist Avi Loeb Over Alien Technology Speculations</h2>

<p>Astrophysicist Adam Frank has publicly criticized Harvard scientist Avi Loeb over his claims regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has sparked a debate in the scientific community. The exchange occurred on social media on November 11, 2025, amid ongoing discussions about the comet's unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>This dispute is significant as it highlights the differing perspectives within the scientific community regarding the interpretation of 3I/ATLAS. Frank and other scientists have expressed skepticism about Loeb's assertions, which suggest that the comet could be an alien spacecraft. The controversy underscores the challenges of public discourse in science, especially with the rise of social media platforms.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of controversy: November 11, 2025</li>
    <li>Key figures: Adam Frank, Avi Loeb, Jason Wright</li>
    <li>Comet in question: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Loeb's claims: 10 anomalies including unusual acceleration and color changes</li>
    <li>Location of discussion: Social media platforms</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 11, 2025, Adam Frank criticized Avi Loeb's claims about 3I/ATLAS on social media. Frank shared an AI-generated image in a tweet, indicating his disbelief in Loeb's assertions regarding the comet's potential alien origin.</p>

<p>Earlier, Loeb had flagged ten anomalies observed in 3I/ATLAS, suggesting these could indicate it is not merely a comet but possibly an alien spacecraft. This perspective has drawn criticism from other scientists, including Jason Wright, who refuted Loeb's arguments in a recent blog post.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Avi Loeb continues to claim that 3I/ATLAS has many anomalous behaviors that lead to the conclusion that it might be an alien spacecraft,” said Jason Wright. “He carefully hedges the probability that it is a spacecraft around 40%, which gives him plausible deniability.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Most of Loeb's anomalies are demonstrably wrong and the rest are in the zone of awesome astronomers expect for comets,” Frank stated in a follow-up tweet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community has often debated the nature of interstellar objects, particularly with the arrival of 3I/ATLAS. Previous discussions have centered on its trajectory and physical characteristics, leading to varied interpretations by scientists. These debates have intensified with scientists like Loeb gaining significant media attention for their unconventional theories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the debate continues, more scientists may weigh in on the discussions surrounding 3I/ATLAS. The focus will likely remain on the verification of claims regarding the comet's anomalies and the implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>
