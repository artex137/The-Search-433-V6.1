      <h2>President Obama Acknowledges Belief in Aliens During Forum</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has stated his belief in the existence of aliens during a discussion on December 5, 2024, at the Obama Foundation’s 2024 Democracy Forum in Chicago, Illinois. Obama made the comments while being interviewed by political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.</p>

<p>Obama's remarks have sparked renewed interest in the topic of extraterrestrial life. He clarified that while he believes in the possibility of life beyond Earth, he has not seen any evidence of actual alien contact. The comments have reignited discussions about UFOs and government transparency regarding unidentified flying objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of comments: December 5, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Obama Foundation’s 2024 Democracy Forum, Chicago, Illinois</li>
    <li>Interviewed by: Brian Tyler Cohen</li>
    <li>Obama's statement: "They’re real, but I haven’t seen them."</li>
    <li>Clarification on Area 51: "They’re not being kept in Area 51."</li>
    <li>Government hearings on UFOs: Ongoing since 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, interest in UFOs has grown significantly. In July 2023, three military veterans testified in Congress regarding the collection of non-human biologics from UFO crash sites. This testimony contributed to the public’s demand for greater transparency from the government on UFO sightings.</p>

<p>In September 2025, the House Oversight Committee held a hearing where witnesses provided accounts of unidentified flying objects, including videos from 2023 and 2024. One witness, investigative journalist George Knapp, discussed a near-catastrophic incident from 1982 involving UFOs and Soviet missile control systems.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low,” Obama stated in an Instagram post following his interview.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UFOs has been part of public discourse for decades, with significant incidents reported since the 1980s. In 2019, a viral meme led to a planned “storm” of Area 51, a military site often linked to alien conspiracy theories. However, the event drew only a small crowd.</p>

<p>Recent congressional hearings have highlighted concerns regarding government transparency about UFO sightings and the potential existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The government is expected to continue its investigations into unidentified flying objects and the implications of recent testimonies. Further hearings may be scheduled as public interest in the topic remains high.</p>
