      <h2>Missed discovery: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could have been found two months earlier</h2>

<p>A team of American researchers has reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was photographed almost two months before its official discovery on July 1, 2025. The images were captured by the TESS spacecraft, which is primarily designed to search for exoplanets, not comets. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant because it highlights the potential of archival data from various astronomical observatories. According to the researchers, earlier detection of such objects can improve calculations of their orbits and provide insights into their activity. This could help further understand the characteristics of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS officially discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>TESS spacecraft first photographed the comet on May 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>Brightness of 3I/ATLAS increased fivefold between May 7 and June 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Decrease in distance from the Sun explains only a 1.5 times brightness increase.</li>
    <li>Researchers speculate about the release of hypervolatile substances as a cause for brightness increase.</li>
    <li>Comet’s core rotation period remains undetermined due to insufficient signal clarity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 7, 2025, the TESS spacecraft captured images of the area where 3I/ATLAS was located. Researchers later analyzed these images, stacking several to detect the comet's movement. By June 3, 2025, they noted a fivefold increase in brightness, prompting further investigation into its composition.</p>

<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was officially discovered during the ATLAS survey. Images from the Vera Rubin Observatory were also found, taken ten days prior to the official discovery, indicating the comet's presence earlier than recognized.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of earlier images of 3I/ATLAS is a prime example of how modern astronomy can leverage multiple sources of data to enhance our understanding of celestial objects,” said one of the researchers involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident underscores a growing trend in astronomy where researchers utilize archival data from various observatories to identify previously unnoticed celestial phenomena. The study of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS is crucial for understanding the differences in chemical compositions between these comets and those originating from our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue analyzing archival data to identify other potential early sightings of interstellar objects. Further studies may focus on the chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS and its behavior as it approaches the Sun.</p>
