      <h2>New comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) visible after sunset</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) has been confirmed as visible from Earth, particularly after sunset, with its brightness reaching about 6th magnitude. The comet was first identified on September 12, 2025, using the SWAN camera on the SOHO spacecraft. It is currently best viewed from southern locations, about 90 minutes after sunset.</p>

<h2>Importance of the comet's visibility</h2>
<p>This comet presents a rare opportunity for amateur astronomers and enthusiasts as it may not return for over 22,000 years. Observers are encouraged to use binoculars or cameras to capture images of the comet, which is expected to gradually fade as it moves away from the sun and Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> C/2025 R2 (SWAN)</li>
  <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> September 12, 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Approximately 6th magnitude</li>
  <li><strong>Best Viewing Time:</strong> 90 minutes after sunset</li>
  <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> Around October 19, 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Orbit Duration:</strong> Approximately 22,554 years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was first confirmed on September 12, 2025. Observers in Australia reported seeing the comet shortly after its discovery. It passed closest to Earth on October 19, 2025, as it reached its peak brightness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was very pleasantly surprised by such a bright comet with a long tail,” said Martin Mašek of the Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, confirming the comet's visibility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Michael Mattiazzo, an Australian comet expert, noted, “I was able to visually see it this morning using 15 x 70 binoculars from Australia.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) is notable for its long orbital period, suggesting it will not return until approximately the year 24,579. Its recent visibility marks a significant event for astronomers and stargazers alike, as comets with such long return periods are rare.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As scientists continue to study the comet's trajectory and brightness, observers are encouraged to capture images while it remains visible. Further analysis of the comet's path will help clarify its characteristics and future visibility.</p>
