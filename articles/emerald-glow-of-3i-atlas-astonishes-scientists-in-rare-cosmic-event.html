      <h2>Emerald Glow of 3I/ATLAS Astonishes Scientists in Rare Cosmic Event</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has captivated observers with a brilliant emerald glow over Egypt on 10 December 2025. The phenomenon has sparked excitement among scientists and astrophotographers, offering new insights into the comet's composition.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides researchers with valuable data on the characteristics of interstellar comets. Space agencies are now intensifying their studies of 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the solar system, although officials confirm that it poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: 10 December 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Black Desert, Egypt</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 270 million kilometres (170 million miles)</li>
    <li>First detected: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Comet designation: C/2025 N1</li>
    <li>Observatories involved: NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, ESA's Juice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, formally designated as C/2025 N1, was first detected on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Chile. It is identified as the third known interstellar visitor to the solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>On 10 December 2025, amateur astronomer Osama Fathi captured images of the comet’s vibrant green glow in Egypt's Black Desert. This unexpected brightness has prompted renewed scientific scrutiny and public interest in the comet.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to pass at a safe distance from Earth on 19 December 2025, continuing its journey back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The bright emerald glow does not indicate alien technology, but instead arises from chemical processes in the comet's coma,” said a representative from NASA.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The recent observations have galvanised the scientific community, prompting renewed analysis of the comet's spectral data,” noted a spokesperson from the European Space Agency.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS's extraordinary brightness challenges previous observations of interstellar comets, which have typically displayed faint blue or neutral tones. The unique composition of 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the formation conditions of distant star systems.</p>

<p>This event follows a series of interstellar visitors that have prompted increased interest in the study of cosmic objects and their implications for planetary science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves deeper into space, scientists will continue to analyse the data collected from various observations. Researchers aim to further understand the comet's unusual chemistry and its implications for the study of interstellar matter.</p>
