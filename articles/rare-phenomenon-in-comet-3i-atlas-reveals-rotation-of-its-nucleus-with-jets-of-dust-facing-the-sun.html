      <h2>Rare phenomenon in comet 3I/ATLAS reveals rotation of its nucleus with jets of dust facing the Sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual behavior in its tail, revealing the rotation of its nucleus and jets of dust facing the Sun, according to observations made between July and September 2025. The comet, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey system, passed closest to the Sun in October 2025 and reached its closest approach to Earth in December 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it allows scientists to understand the physical properties of a celestial body formed in another star system. Ongoing monitoring of 3I/ATLAS will provide insights into its composition and behavior as it interacts with the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth was in December 2025, at 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted over 37 nights between July and September 2025.</li>
    <li>The jets of material oscillate every 7 hours and 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>The comet completes a rotation approximately every 15 hours and 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS survey system discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet approached the Sun in October 2025, marking the closest distance to the solar body. Continuous observations were made from July to September 2025, revealing the periodic oscillation of jets from the comet's nucleus. By December 2025, the comet reached its closest point to Earth, allowing for extensive monitoring.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The rhythmic pattern of the jets is key to unlocking the secrets of the cometary nucleus,” said a member of the research team. “This activity is driven by the heating of the core surface by the Sun, causing volatile ices to sublimate and drag dust particles with them.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its interstellar origin, which provides a unique opportunity to study a celestial body that has not previously been influenced by solar heat and radiation. Its behavior may offer insights into the formation processes of comets, suggesting that these processes may be universal across different star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the evolution of the jets from 3I/ATLAS to refine models regarding the composition and internal structure of cometary nuclei. This ongoing research aims to deepen the understanding of cometary behavior and its implications for the study of celestial bodies.</p>
