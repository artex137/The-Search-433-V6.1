      <h2>‘Swapping out God,’ Neil deGrasse Tyson warns against assuming 3I/Atlas is an alien spaceship</h2>

<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson has cautioned against speculation that the interstellar object 3I/Atlas is an alien spacecraft. Tyson, a renowned astrophysicist, made his comments during a discussion about the comet's rapid approach to the solar system, which has been tracked at speeds of approximately <strong>210,000 km/h</strong> (about <strong>130,000 mph</strong>). The comet is expected to pass relatively close to four planets, but not Earth, in the coming days.</p>

<p>Tyson's remarks are significant as they highlight the ongoing debate among astronomers regarding the nature of 3I/Atlas. The object is noted for its unusual speed, trajectory, and brightness, prompting some experts, including Harvard professor Avi Loeb, to theorize it may be a nuclear-powered spacecraft. Tyson emphasizes the need for caution and further investigation rather than jumping to conclusions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas is traveling at approximately <strong>210,000 km/h</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet has been active and has a tail (coma) typical of comets.</li>
    <li>It is predicted to pass close to four planets in October 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA aims to photograph 3I/Atlas using telescopes orbiting Mars.</li>
    <li>Tyson has stated that we have only cataloged two interstellar objects before 3I/Atlas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been moving through the solar system at high speed, with astronomers tracking its trajectory. Observations indicate that it will reach its closest point to Mars in October 2023. The comet's unusual characteristics have prompted discussions among scientists regarding its origin and nature.</p>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that 3I/Atlas could be a nuclear-powered alien spacecraft, sparking interest and debate in the scientific community. Tyson has responded to these claims, advocating for a more cautious approach to understanding the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Whatever anomalous behavior these objects exhibit, I’m delighted that they’re finally in the catalog.” 
    <strong>— Neil deGrasse Tyson</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The moment you say, ‘I don’t know what I’m looking at, therefore I know what I’m looking at. I’m looking at aliens.’ That is a leap.” 
    <strong>— Neil deGrasse Tyson</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/Atlas is notable as it represents one of the few interstellar objects observed by scientists. Prior to this, only two similar objects have been cataloged, prompting a push for better observational technologies.</p>

<p>Tyson points out that the scientific community has historically faced similar challenges in understanding phenomena, often attributing unknowns to divine powers in the past. He warns against replacing this "God of the gaps" thinking with "alien of the gaps" reasoning.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas approaches Mars, NASA plans to conduct observations to gather more data about the comet. This effort may help clarify the object's properties and contribute to ongoing research into interstellar objects.</p>
