      <h2>'Exotic vehicle of unknown origin' being held at US army base in latest claim</h2>

<p>A mysterious UFO has reportedly been held at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland for decades, according to a recent report. The facility has housed the "machine," which some believe contains secrets about extraterrestrial life, while experts attempt to uncover its mysteries.</p>

<p>This situation is significant as it comes amid a surge of UFO sightings globally. Authorities are investigating claims that the naval base has been secretly studying an "exotic vehicle of unknown origin." This revelation has reignited public interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the government's role in investigating such phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, USA</li>
    <li>Reported duration: Held for decades, potentially since the 1950s</li>
    <li>Allegations made by: Anonymous sources connected to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR)</li>
    <li>Whistleblower: Luis Elizondo, former senior intelligence official</li>
    <li>Claims of reverse-engineering: Ongoing efforts to analyze technology from non-human craft</li>
    <li>Reported surveillance: Two aircraft, including Chinese drones and unidentified UFOs, reportedly monitoring the base</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent reports have suggested that the Naval Air Station Patuxent River has been housing a UFO for decades. Investigations into the site have been ongoing, with whistleblower Luis Elizondo providing testimony in 2024 regarding alleged secret government programs aimed at recovering and reverse-engineering fallen spacecraft.</p>

<p>According to Elizondo, specific facilities for examining extraterrestrial aircraft were constructed, including a hangar at the Pax River base. However, anonymous sources have disputed this claim, stating that no new constructions have taken place following injunctions by the CIA's former director of science and technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “These facilities included locations in the Las Vegas area and a newly built hangar at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station ('PAX'),” said Luis Elizondo during his testimony before Congress.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The US military has consistently argued that there has never been any physical evidence of UFOs ever recorded,” noted an unnamed military official.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Reports of UFO sightings have increased in recent years, leading to renewed public interest in the topic. The US military has historically denied the existence of physical evidence related to UFOs, despite claims from former government employees and scientists. Elizondo's testimony has added to the ongoing debate about government transparency regarding extraterrestrial investigations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims surrounding the Naval Air Station Patuxent River are expected to continue. Authorities may assess the validity of the allegations and explore the implications of any potential discoveries related to extraterrestrial technology.</p>
