      <h2>He Swore Aliens Experimented On Him—But an Altered State of Consciousness Could Be to Blame, Scientists Say</h2>

<p>In 1957, Antônio Vilas Boas, a farmer in rural Brazil, claimed he was abducted by aliens who experimented on him. He reported seeing mysterious red lights and being taken aboard a spacecraft where he was subjected to medical procedures. Nearly 70 years later, his account remains one of the most famous alien abduction stories, alongside others like those of Barney and Betty Hill and Travis Walton.</p>

<p>Experts are now examining whether Boas' experience and similar claims may be explained by medical phenomena rather than extraterrestrial encounters. Authorities and researchers, including the National UFO Reporting Center, are investigating the nature of these reports and their psychological underpinnings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: 1957</li>
    <li>Location: Rural Brazil</li>
    <li>Notable reports: Thousands of alien encounters reported since 1957, according to the National UFO Reporting Center</li>
    <li>Key experts: Daniel J. Cole, M.D., Benjamin Radford, and Peter Davenport</li>
    <li>NUFORC position: Emotional impact is a criterion for evaluating reports</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1957, Antônio Vilas Boas claimed he encountered a spacecraft while plowing his field. He reported being taken aboard and experimented on by aliens. Since then, many similar claims have emerged, leading to ongoing investigations by researchers.</p>

<p>In recent discussions, experts have highlighted the possibility that experiences of accidental awareness during anesthesia may resemble abduction accounts. This could explain some reports of alien encounters as psychological phenomena rather than actual events.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This area is not well understood. But it is possible that intraoperative awareness could result in dissociative phenomena and false memories,” said Daniel J. Cole, M.D., former president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“People are profoundly moved by their sightings, oftentimes,” said Peter Davenport, director of the National UFO Reporting Center. “You can tell they’re sincere and reporting accurately just by the emotion they’re exhibiting as they tell their story.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Boas’ account is part of a broader phenomenon of alien abduction claims, which have garnered significant public interest and media coverage. Theories abound regarding the origins of these reports, with some suggesting they may arise from cultural influences, including popular media. The relationship between psychological trauma and perceived alien encounters is an area of ongoing research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the psychological aspects of alien abduction claims are ongoing, with researchers examining the connection between medical experiences and reported encounters. The discourse surrounding these claims continues to evolve as new insights emerge.</p>
