      <h2>UN Team Activated to Watch Possible ‘Alien’ Object: Interstellar Visitor 3I/ATLAS to Pass Near Earth in Dec</h2>

<p>A new interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS has captured the attention of scientists globally. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a United Nations-endorsed group, has announced a global observing campaign for this comet-like object, set to run from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The campaign aims to enhance the study of comets, which are challenging to observe due to their glowing gas clouds and tails. Astronomers worldwide will collect data on 3I/ATLAS simultaneously, with participation requiring attendance at a workshop before November 7, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign Duration:</strong> November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Participation Deadline:</strong> November 7, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Size:</strong> More than 33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Features:</strong> Eight unusual characteristics identified</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has shown eight unusual features, prompting scrutiny from scientists, including Harvard's Avi Loeb. These features include an unusual orbit, a sunward jet, and a significantly larger size compared to previous interstellar visitors.</p>

<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS will pass closest to the Sun. Researchers anticipate that if it is a technological object, it may exhibit a sudden maneuver or release smaller objects around this time.</p>

<blockquote>“By the end of this week, it will come within 29 million kilometers from Mars,” said Loeb. “There are several orbiters there that were deposited there by NASA, by the European Space Agency, by the Chinese Space Agency, and we will get much more information about it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, like Oumuamua and Borisov, have intrigued scientists, but 3I/ATLAS presents unique characteristics that have raised questions about its origin. The object’s unusual features, such as its metal composition and low water content, have led to speculation about its nature.</p>

<p>Loeb and his colleagues have calculated that no spacecraft is currently positioned to intercept 3I/ATLAS, although NASA's Juno spacecraft could have reached it if it had sufficient fuel.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the campaign progresses, scientists hope to gather more information about 3I/ATLAS. By Christmas 2025, they expect to determine whether it is simply another odd comet or something more extraordinary from beyond our Solar System.</p>
