      <h2>New radio signals and “heartbeat-like” jets from 3I/Atlas spark curiosity as some viewers say they notice a repeating pattern</h2>

<p>3I/Atlas, the interstellar object passing through our solar system, has generated significant interest with unusual radio readings and a jet pattern that brightens and fades in a steady rhythm. These phenomena have emerged in recent weeks, capturing the attention of astronomers and the public alike.</p>

<p>The emergence of these signals and the jet pattern is noteworthy as it challenges existing knowledge about comet behavior. Scientists are currently investigating these anomalies while cautioning against drawing premature conclusions. Observations will continue as 3I/Atlas approaches its closest pass to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas is an interstellar object currently passing through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Unusual radio signals have been detected at two specific frequencies.</li>
    <li>A jet pattern from 3I/Atlas brightens and dims every 16 hours.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19.</li>
    <li>Scientists have not disclosed specific details about the origins of these phenomena.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, astronomers reported that 3I/Atlas produces a narrow radio signal, which is uncommon for comets. This signal appeared as the object was subjected to strong heat and pressure from the Sun.</p>

<p>Shortly after, new images revealed a jet from 3I/Atlas that exhibits a regular brightening and dimming pattern, prompting comparisons to a heartbeat due to its 16-hour cycle. Scientists have noted that this behavior is atypical for comets, which usually release gas and dust in a random manner.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It’s still far too early to say if the radio signal and the heartbeat-like jet are connected,” scientists have stated, emphasizing the need for further observation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent behavior of 3I/Atlas contrasts with typical comet activity, which is generally unpredictable. The unusual patterns observed have sparked curiosity among the public and scientific community, raising questions about the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas approaches Earth on December 19, telescopes worldwide are preparing for detailed observations. Researchers will monitor the radio signals and jet activity to determine if these patterns persist or change as the object moves away from the Sun.</p>
