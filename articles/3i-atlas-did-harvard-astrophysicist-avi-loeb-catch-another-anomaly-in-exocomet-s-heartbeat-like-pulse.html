      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Did Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb Catch Another Anomaly In Exocomet’s Heartbeat-Like Pulse?</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has reported a new anomaly in the behavior of Comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first spotted by the Chile-based Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025. The comet has exhibited peculiar characteristics, including a pulsating light variability with a period of 16.16 hours, according to a blog post by Loeb.</p>

<p>This discovery could have implications for our understanding of interstellar objects. Loeb has identified 13 anomalies in 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may not behave like a typical comet. Researchers are continuing to study the comet's behavior closely to understand its nature and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It performed perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has identified 13 anomalies in its behavior.</li>
    <li>The pulsating variability period is 16.16 hours.</li>
    <li>The observations were conducted using multiple ground-based telescopes from July 2 to July 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope captured images of 3I/ATLAS on July 21, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected by ATLAS. Following its discovery, researchers conducted observations from July 2 to July 29 using various ground-based telescopes. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun, or perihelion, on October 29, 2025. Avi Loeb published findings about the comet's anomalous behavior, including its pulsating light, in a blog post.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb noted, "If the nucleus is spinning over 16.16 hours, why was the periodic variability at a level of tens of percent in total light?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>He further stated, "This heartbeat pattern should have been apparent in a series of well-calibrated snapshots of the coma over several days but none was systematically studied in the published literature."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The peculiar characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have captured the attention of astronomers and the public, prompting further investigation into its nature and potential significance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to determine the nature of its pulsating jets and whether they are indicative of natural or technological origins. Further studies are anticipated to clarify the comet's behavior and characteristics.</p>
