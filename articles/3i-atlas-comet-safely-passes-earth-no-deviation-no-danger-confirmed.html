      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Safely Passes Earth — No Deviation, No Danger Confirmed</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has safely passed Earth's orbit without any change in its velocity or direction, NASA confirmed on 30 October 2025. The comet is travelling at a steady speed of 68.3 km/s and is expected to make its closest approach on 19 December 2025 at a distance of 268 million kilometres from Earth, which is roughly twice the distance between Earth and the Sun. There have been no injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it alleviates concerns raised in online speculation regarding the comet's trajectory. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have stated that the comet continues on its expected path, with no signs of deviation or danger to Earth, Venus, or Mars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of 68.3 km/s.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on 19 December 2025, at a distance of 268 million km.</li>
    <li>The comet has shown no deviation from its predicted path since its detection in July 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA confirm there is no threat to Earth, Venus, or Mars.</li>
    <li>The minimum separation from Mars occurred in early October 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will fade from view early next year as it exits the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2025. Since then, it has been monitored by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the ESA. Speculation about its trajectory intensified leading up to its closest approach. On 30 October 2025, NASA confirmed that the comet's trajectory remains unchanged.</p>

<p>On 3 November 2025, 3I/ATLAS will align with Venus at a safe distance of 97 million kilometres.</p>

<blockquote>“No manoeuvring toward Earth; it continues on its expected trajectory,” NASA stated, reaffirming there is no cause for concern.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is travelling on a hyperbolic trajectory, similar to previous interstellar objects like ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These objects are not gravitationally bound to the Sun and will leave the Solar System permanently after passing it. Observing 3I/ATLAS provides valuable insights into the chemical composition of objects from outside the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS using the Hubble Space Telescope, ESA's JUICE mission, and ground-based observatories across Asia and Europe. The data collected will enhance understanding of how interstellar objects behave under solar radiation.</p>
