      <h2>New Hubble Images Confirm 3I/ATLAS Emits Jet Toward the Sun</h2>

<p>On January 7, 2026, the Hubble Space Telescope captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a powerful jet directed toward the Sun. This observation challenges established scientific understanding of comet behavior.</p>

<p>The new findings have prompted scientists to reconsider the physical characteristics of comets. According to data from NASA, ESA, and the Space Telescope Science Institute, the jet, which extends to a distance comparable to the Earth-Moon gap, defies traditional cometary physics, which states that tails should always point away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: January 7, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: Observations conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope</li>
    <li>Jet size: Comparable to the Earth-Moon distance</li>
    <li>Initial imaging date: July 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Observation angle: 10 degrees from sunward direction</li>
    <li>Statistical probability of observed alignment: Less than 1 in 10,000</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, Hubble first imaged 3I/ATLAS, noting an asymmetrical coma elongated toward the Sun. Subsequent observations over several months confirmed the presence of a sunward jet, along with two additional jets. These observations led researchers to rule out projection effects, indicating an actual physical structure contrary to established comet behavior.</p>

<p>During a press conference on November 19, 2025, NASA officials described 3I/ATLAS as a “regular comet,” but did not address the implications of the sunward jet. The continued observations have raised significant questions about the object's behavior and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The anti-tail jet of 3I/ATLAS is not a footnote. It is a central feature, observed repeatedly, measured quantitatively.” – NASA officials
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, the behavior of comets has been understood through the lens of solar radiation and sublimation. The existence of anti-tails has typically been attributed to optical illusions. However, the observations of 3I/ATLAS have prompted scientists to explore alternative explanations, such as unusual volatile composition or asymmetric internal structure, none of which fully account for the observed phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS to better understand its unique characteristics. The scientific community remains focused on determining whether the sunward jet is an anomaly or indicative of new physical mechanisms at play.</p>
