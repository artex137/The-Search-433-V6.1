      <p class="byline">Published 2026-02-14 18:36 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is big. Webb sees methane.</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, first observed by the ATLAS telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025, is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our Solar System. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, passing the Sun at a distance of approximately 200 million kilometers. By December 19, 2025, it had swept past Earth at a distance of roughly 270 million kilometers and is now heading toward Jupiter.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for scientists as they closely monitor the comet and uncover new details about its composition. Recent spectral analyses from the James Webb Space Telescope have detected methane in the comet’s coma, which is important for understanding the formation of planets and comets. The presence of methane suggests that the comet formed in an environment rich in organic molecules.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of about 200 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It passed Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of the comet has been estimated to be around 2.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects measured 80 and 400 meters, respectively.</li>
    <li>Initial observations of the comet date back to June 14, 2025, with earlier detections by the TESS satellite on May 7, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 7, 2025, the TESS satellite captured images of the comet. Following this, observations were recorded on June 14, 2025, by the ATLAS and Zwicky Transient Facility. The official discovery was made on July 1, 2025. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, and passed Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>Since its discovery, scientists have continuously monitored the comet, utilizing data from the Hubble and Webb telescopes to estimate its size and analyze its chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of methane in an interstellar object is a breakthrough. These chemical signatures allow us to compare the genesis of distant comets with our own Solar System,” said a lead researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is significant not only for its size but also for the insights it provides into the origins of comets. Previous interstellar visitors were much smaller, and the detection of methane raises questions about the transport of life’s building blocks across the universe. Understanding the environments in which these comets form can enhance our knowledge of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, utilizing various telescopes to gather more data about its composition and trajectory. Further analysis will help clarify the implications of its methane content and the potential for similar interstellar objects.</p>
