      <h2>No, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS hasn't 'changed color', scientists say</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar visitor to our solar system, has not changed color as previously reported, according to scientists. The comet was first discovered in July and made its closest pass to the sun on October 30, 2023. During this event, three sun-facing spacecraft captured images of the comet, revealing a rapid brightening that has intrigued astronomers.</p>

<p>This clarification matters as media outlets have misreported the comet's appearance, claiming it has changed color multiple times. Authorities and scientists are working to dispel these misconceptions and provide accurate information about the comet's behavior and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun occurred on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>Imaging conducted by three sun-facing spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Comet will pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 270 million km.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was scheduled to capture imagery on October 3, 2023, but operations are on hold due to a government shutdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023. It made its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2023, prompting extensive imaging by space agencies. Reports of the comet changing color emerged shortly thereafter, leading to confusion among the public and media.</p>

<p>According to Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Lowell Observatory, the comet has only appeared to change color once, when its gas coma brightened earlier this year as it approached the sun. This observation occurred before recent reports about its supposed color change.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We don't have any evidence for the gas coma changing colors,” said Qicheng Zhang, one of the authors of the study published on arXiv. “Our result just showed that gas coma is likely still around and contributing substantially to the overall brightness.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are often described as "dirty snowballs" due to their icy cores made of frozen gases, rock, and dust. As they approach the sun, these materials vaporize, forming a bright halo known as a coma. This phenomenon can create a tail that extends away from the comet as solar wind pushes the gases outward.</p>

<p>The comet's unexpected brightening has drawn attention, but misinformation has also circulated, including conspiracy theories suggesting it may be an alien spacecraft. However, experts emphasize that this comet provides valuable insights into conditions beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on December 19, 2023, scientists will continue to monitor the comet's behavior and gather more data. Efforts to clarify misconceptions and provide accurate information to the public will remain a priority for astronomers and space agencies.</p>
