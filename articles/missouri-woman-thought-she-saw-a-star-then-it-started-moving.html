      <h2>Missouri Woman Reports UFO Sighting Near Cardwell</h2>

<p>A woman in Cardwell, Missouri, has reported a sighting of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) on the night of October 9, 2025. The eyewitness claimed she initially thought she was observing a star until it began to move, along with two other lights in the sky.</p>

<p>The incident has drawn attention due to the unusual nature of the sighting. Authorities have noted that Cardwell is located in a remote area, far from major airports or military installations, which makes the reports particularly intriguing. The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) has documented the eyewitness account.</p>
