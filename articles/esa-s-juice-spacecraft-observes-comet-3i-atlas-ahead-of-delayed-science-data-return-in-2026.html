      <h2>ESA’s Juice spacecraft observes comet 3I/ATLAS ahead of delayed science data return in 2026</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) spacecraft has observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun, capturing images on November 2, 2025, approximately 66 million kilometers from the comet. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides early visual data on the comet's activity, with the full science data not expected to return to Earth until February 2026. ESA has reported that preliminary images reveal the comet’s coma and two tails, which will contribute to ongoing studies of the comet’s composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: November 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the comet: Approximately 66 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Data return timeframe: Full dataset expected between February 18 and 20, 2026</li>
    <li>Instruments used: NavCam, JANUS, MAJIS, UVS, SWI, PEP</li>
    <li>Comet detection date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 30 million kilometers (via Mars Express)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Río Hurtado, Chile. The comet then moved behind the Sun, complicating Earth-based observations.</p>

<p>In October 2025, ESA utilized interplanetary missions, including Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), to gather data on the comet as it passed near Mars. Juice conducted its observations in November 2025, shortly after the comet's perihelion, which is the closest point in its orbit to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The initial observations from Juice provide vital insights into the comet’s activity and tail formation,” said ESA representatives in a recent update.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Although the NavCam is primarily designed for navigation, it has contributed valuable preliminary data on the comet,” the ESA noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to Juice's observations, the comet had been challenging to study due to its position behind the Sun after its discovery. ESA's use of multiple missions to track 3I/ATLAS illustrates the agency's commitment to monitoring celestial bodies in the Solar System.</p>

<p>The observations from Juice are expected to enhance the understanding of the comet's activity levels and tail formation, contributing to broader knowledge of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA will continue to analyze the data from Juice and expects the full dataset to arrive in February 2026, which will include detailed images and measurements of 3I/ATLAS's composition and activity.</p>
