      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Reaches Closest Point to the Sun</h2>
<p>On October 29, Comet 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, approximately 210 million kilometres from the Sun, on the opposite side from Earth, blocking visibility from our planet. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's trajectory.</p>

<p>This event is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in our Solar System, following 1I/2017 U1 ‘Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. Authorities and researchers are now focusing on studying its unique chemical composition and age, which could provide insights into the early solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: 210 million kilometres (1.4 times the distance from the Sun to Earth)</li>
    <li>First detected: July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Estimated age: Over 7 billion years</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide levels: Higher than most comets in the Solar System</li>
    <li>Nickel-to-other-elements ratio: Higher than that seen in local comets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial Last Alert System. Following its discovery, speculation about the possibility of alien life arose, a trend seen with previous interstellar discoveries.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2025, the comet reached its closest point to the Sun, allowing researchers to gather important data about its composition. Observations are ongoing, with plans for further studies using various European Space Agency missions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we talk about aliens first, we might miss all this amazing information,” said Laura Nicole Driessen, a Postdoctoral Researcher in Radio Astronomy at the University of Sydney.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” Driessen added, emphasizing the importance of focusing on scientific inquiry over speculation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its potential age and unique chemical signatures, which provide critical insights into the formation of our Solar System. Previous interstellar objects have sparked similar speculation regarding extraterrestrial life, highlighting a recurring issue in astronomical discourse.</p>
<p>The discovery of radio light by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967, initially dubbed “Little Green Men,” illustrates the long-standing tension between scientific discovery and public fascination with the idea of aliens.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study Comet 3I/ATLAS’s composition and trajectory using ground-based telescopes and European Space Agency missions, including the Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. Further observations will enhance our understanding of this ancient interstellar visitor.</p>
