      <h2>China's Mars orbiter captures rare images of interstellar comet</h2>

<p>A Chinese Martian orbiter has photographed a rare interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, as it passed near Mars on October 3, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA). The orbiter was approximately 29 million kilometers from Mars during this observation.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks one of the closest encounters with the comet, which is the third confirmed interstellar object following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The Tianwen 1 project team prepared for the observation in early September, conducting calculations and simulations to develop a specific imaging plan based on the comet's trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>Orbiter was 29 million kilometers from Mars during the observation.</li>
    <li>Comet discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun occurred in late October, at approximately 210 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Comet's estimated age is between 3 to 11 billion years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. Following its discovery, additional observations were made using data from three different ATLAS telescopes and the Zwicky Transient Facility in California.</p>

<p>In early September, the Tianwen 1 project team began preparations for the observation of 3I/ATLAS, performing calculations and simulations to finalize their imaging plan. The successful capture of images occurred on October 3, 2023, as the comet passed near Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This observation is a rare opportunity to study the composition and evolution of interstellar objects,” said a representative from the CNSA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS is particularly notable for its potential to provide insights into the early stellar history of exoplanets. It is believed to have formed around an ancient star at the center of the Milky Way, making it a valuable subject for scientific study.</p>

<p>This mission is part of China's broader efforts in planetary exploration, which include the successful Tianwen 1 mission that aims to gather data on Mars and its environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following this successful observation, scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from the images of 3I/ATLAS to enhance understanding of its composition and origins. Further studies are planned to explore the implications of this comet on the study of interstellar objects.</p>
