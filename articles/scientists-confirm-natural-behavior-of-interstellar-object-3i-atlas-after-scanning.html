      <h2>Scientists confirm natural behavior of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS after scanning</h2>

<p>An international team of researchers has confirmed the natural behavior of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS following observations made in December 2025 using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. The analysis, part of the Breakthrough Listen project, found no artificial radio emissions from the comet during its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it reinforces the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet, dismissing earlier speculation about a potential technological origin. Researchers are now focusing on further observations to enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>The object passed approximately 167 million kilometers from Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, in October 2025, at a distance of about 1.4 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed greater than 30 kilometers per second relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>The Green Bank Telescope conducted its scan on December 18, 2025, covering frequencies between 1 and 12 GHz.</li>
    <li>No artificial emissions were detected during the observation period.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as a fast-moving dot in images captured by the ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025. Subsequent calculations confirmed its interstellar origin. The object reached perihelion in October 2025, and on December 19, it made its closest approach to Earth, allowing for detailed observations.</p>

<p>On December 18, 2025, the Green Bank Telescope was directed towards 3I/ATLAS to search for technosignatures. Following the observations, researchers reported that the behavior of the comet was consistent with natural cometary characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behavior of 3I/ATLAS remained consistent with expectations of a natural comet throughout the observation,” the Breakthrough Listen project stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, identified in 2019. While 1I/’Oumuamua exhibited unusual characteristics, including an elongated shape and no visible coma, 2I/Borisov displayed classic cometary features. 3I/ATLAS combines traits from both objects, featuring a robust size and evident cometary activity.</p>

<p>The rarity of interstellar objects emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring and research to better understand their nature and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the solar system. Ongoing campaigns will track its activity and collect additional data to refine models of interstellar objects.</p>
