      <h2>NASA: 3I/ATLAS Increasing Speed And Heading Towards Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that comet 3I/ATLAS is accelerating as it approaches Earth. The interstellar object, discovered earlier this year, is currently moving at approximately 244,000 kilometers per hour, up from 220,000 kilometers per hour when it was first detected. The comet reached its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023, but will not pose a threat to Earth, as it will pass at a distance of 170 million miles (about 270 million kilometers).</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the third interstellar comet to traverse our solar system. While NASA has assured the public that there is no danger, some scientists have raised questions about the nature of the comet. NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, has engaged with public interest, particularly on social media, in response to inquiries about the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached a speed of approximately 244,000 km/h (152,000 mph).</li>
    <li>It will come as close as 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) to Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered earlier in 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to the sun occurred on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed it poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Sean Duffy is the acting administrator of NASA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered earlier this year and has since been observed as it travels through our solar system. It reached its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023. As of now, it has increased its speed significantly since its initial detection.</p>

<p>NASA has consistently communicated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the sun again on October 30, 2025, at a distance of about 130 million miles (210 million kilometers).</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away,” NASA stated in a press release. “The closest it will approach our planet is about 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles, or 270 million kilometers).”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sean Duffy explained via social media, “3 = the third. I = interstellar, meaning from beyond our solar system. ATLAS = discovered by our Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) team.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet identified in our solar system. Previous interstellar comets have also raised public interest and scientific inquiry. The phenomenon of interstellar objects traveling through our solar system has prompted discussions about space exploration and potential threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor the comet as it travels through the solar system. Further data collection and analysis will be conducted to understand more about the object's characteristics and trajectory.</p>
