      <h2>Harvard's Avi Loeb Claims Interstellar 3I/ATLAS Is 'Anomalously' Aligned With the Sun</h2>

<p>Harvard Professor <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has reported that the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> exhibits an alignment with the Sun that is statistically unlikely to occur by chance. The findings were detailed in a study co-authored by <strong>Toni Scarmato</strong> of the Scarmato Observatory. The research utilized data from the Hubble Space Telescope and was published recently.</p>

<p>This study is significant as it revives the debate on whether objects like 3I/ATLAS are influenced by unknown forces or shaped purely by random chance. The researchers have noted that the alignment of 3I/ATLAS could have implications for understanding the nature of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar visitor to our solar system.</li>
    <li>The object's rotation axis is aligned with the Sun to within 10–20 degrees.</li>
    <li>The probability of this alignment occurring by chance is estimated to be between 1.5% and 6%.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS rotates approximately every 7.1 hours.</li>
    <li>The study suggests that the alignment may result from gas sublimation on the comet's surface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS has progressed as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The object was first identified as an interstellar visitor.</li>
    <li>Loeb and Scarmato conducted harmonic modelling and analyzed Hubble data.</li>
    <li>They published their findings, noting the object's unique alignment with the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Instead, 3I/ATLAS moves with such precision that it is highly unlikely to be an accident,” said Professor Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The periodic wobble of the jet around the rotation axis did not change during perihelion,” Loeb added, emphasizing the stability of the object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study places 3I/ATLAS alongside earlier interstellar objects, such as <strong>'Oumuamua</strong>, which have sparked discussions about the nature and origins of such cosmic visitors. Previous research has suggested that many interstellar objects might have random orientations upon entering the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze 3I/ATLAS to determine whether its alignment is a natural phenomenon or indicative of more complex processes. The ongoing study may provide further insights into the characteristics of interstellar objects.</p>
