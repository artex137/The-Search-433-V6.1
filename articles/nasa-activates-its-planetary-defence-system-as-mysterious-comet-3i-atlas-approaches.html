      <h2>NASA activates its planetary defence system as mysterious comet 3I/ATLAS approaches</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defence monitoring systems after detecting the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently racing through space at more than 209,000 kilometres per hour. The comet, approximately five kilometres wide, is expected to make a brief pass near Earth in the coming days. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This activation is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever discovered, and its unusual characteristics have piqued the interest of scientists. NASA is working in conjunction with the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) to monitor the comet's trajectory closely. Although there is no threat to Earth, the agency has deemed the comet's behaviour unusual enough to warrant ongoing observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately 5 kilometres wide</li>
    <li>Speed: Over 209,000 kilometres per hour</li>
    <li>Discovery: By the ATLAS project (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System)</li>
    <li>Type: Third interstellar comet discovered</li>
    <li>Monitoring: Ongoing by NASA and IAWN</li>
    <li>Threat level: No danger to Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS project, prompting immediate interest from astronomers. After initial observations, scientists noted odd fluctuations in the comet's speed and trajectory that could not be explained by gravitational forces. This led to the detection of unusual gases and synthetic-like compounds in the comet's coma. As a precaution, NASA activated its planetary defence monitoring systems to ensure that any sudden changes would be detected.</p>

<p>Since the news broke, conspiracy theories have emerged on social media, speculating that the comet could be an alien spacecraft. However, scientists have dismissed these claims, asserting there is no credible evidence to support such theories.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While there’s no danger to Earth, the comet’s behaviour is unusual enough to warrant close observation,” said a NASA spokesperson. “The oddities observed so far can be explained through physics, chemistry, and continued observation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The activation of NASA’s planetary defence system is part of a broader effort to monitor and study potentially hazardous space objects. This system includes powerful telescopes that scan the skies for incoming objects, enabling NASA to plan potential deflection strategies if necessary. Previous incidents involving asteroids have highlighted the importance of such monitoring systems in ensuring Earth’s safety.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely as it approaches Earth. Scientists plan to use this opportunity to learn more about the comet and its unique characteristics, treating it as a valuable research opportunity rather than a crisis.</p>
