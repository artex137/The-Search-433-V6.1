      <h2>NASA identifies organic molecules and interstellar comet eruption after passage by the Sun</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed the presence of organic molecules on comet 3I ATLAS following its recent passage near the Sun. The findings were announced on February 10, 2026, during a press briefing at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the chemical composition of comets, which may help scientists understand the origins of organic materials in the solar system. NASA is currently analyzing data collected during the comet's approach to further investigate its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS passed near the Sun on February 5, 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is leading the analysis of the comet's data.</li>
    <li>Organic molecules were detected during the comet's solar flyby.</li>
    <li>The findings were announced during a press briefing on February 10, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 5, 2026, comet 3I ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun. During this flyby, NASA instruments detected organic molecules in the comet's composition. The results were shared publicly in a press briefing on February 10, 2026, where scientists discussed the implications of these findings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The identification of organic molecules in comet 3I ATLAS is a groundbreaking discovery that could reshape our understanding of cometary chemistry,” said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery is part of ongoing research into the chemical makeup of comets. Previous studies have suggested that comets may carry essential building blocks for life, including organic compounds. Understanding these molecules can provide insights into the early solar system and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue analyzing the data collected from comet 3I ATLAS to deepen its understanding of the organic molecules present. Further studies are expected to be released in the coming months as researchers evaluate the implications of these findings.</p>
