      <h2>Public will soon be able to invest in 'advanced or reverse-engineered alien technology'</h2>

<p>An investment firm has announced plans to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on companies it claims have access to alien technology. Tuttle Capital, based in the United States, has filed its UFO Disclosure AI Powered ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and aims to capitalize on recent government disclosures about unidentified flying objects (UFOs).</p>

<p>This fund is significant as it represents a new avenue for investors to engage with speculative technology sectors. Tuttle Capital describes itself as "the antidote to Wall Street" and intends to leverage its proprietary investment strategy, known as HEAT—hedges, edges, asymmetry, themes—to identify and invest in companies involved in advanced technologies potentially inspired by extraterrestrial innovations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>ETF filed with the SEC, name: UFO Disclosure AI Powered ETF</li>

    <li>Focus areas include aerospace, defense, materials, and energy firms</li>
    <li>Potential investments in companies involved in detecting unidentified anomalous phenomena</li>
    <li>CEO Matthew Tuttle has commented on the power sources of UFOs</li>
