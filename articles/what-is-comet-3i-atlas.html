      <h2>What is comet 3I/ATLAS?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) station in Chile, has captured public interest as the third interstellar object ever identified. This comet, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is notable for its unique characteristics and its journey through the Solar System.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has reignited discussions about interstellar objects and their significance in understanding planetary formation. Astronomers are currently studying its composition and trajectory, which may provide insights into the origins of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery location:</strong> ATLAS station, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated nucleus diameter:</strong> 1 kilometer</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025 (1.80 astronomical units)</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum speed at perihelion:</strong> 68 kilometers per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. It has been revealed that the comet is likely between 3 and 14 billion years old, suggesting it may be older than the Solar System. Observations indicate that it is rich in carbon dioxide, likely formed far from its parent star. The comet is currently on a trajectory toward the Sun, with perihelion expected on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>Following perihelion, 3I/ATLAS will pass near Venus on November 3, 2025, before its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet will continue its journey through the Solar System, making its closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, before exiting back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This comet is unlike any other. Its unique tail structure and composition challenge our understanding of how interstellar objects behave," said Dr. Bryce Bolin, lead author of a study on 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These discoveries have enhanced scientific discussions regarding the nature of interstellar objects and their implications for planetary science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. The European Space Agency's Juice spacecraft will attempt to observe the comet during its journey, contributing to ongoing research into interstellar objects.</p>
