      <h2>New 3I/ATLAS Images Reveal Possible Ice Volcanoes on Ancient Interstellar Object</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS indicate that the comet may be erupting in multiple ice volcanoes as it travels through the inner solar system. The findings were presented in a study posted to arXiv and mark one of the most detailed attempts to understand the behaviour of an object older than the Sun itself. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The discovery is significant as it offers scientists a rare opportunity to study material that originates from another star system, potentially providing insights into the universe's earliest period. Researchers have reported that the cryovolcanoes on 3I/ATLAS have become more active as the comet approaches the Sun, which is likely destabilising volatile compounds inside the comet’s nucleus.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Age: Estimated between 7 and 14 billion years</li>
    <li>Event: Eruptions of cryovolcanoes observed</li>
    <li>Location: Inner solar system</li>
    <li>Study posted: arXiv</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed moving closer to the Sun, which has likely increased the activity of its cryovolcanoes. As the temperature and solar radiation rise, volatile compounds inside the comet's nucleus have destabilised, leading to the expulsion of gas, dust, and frozen material.</p>
<p>Researchers have documented the comet's behaviour, noting that the eruptions produce visible plumes similar to those seen on icy dwarf planets and frozen moons beyond Neptune. This activity accounts for the strange patterns seen in earlier telescope images.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The eruptions release ancient compounds that formed billions of years before the Sun,” researchers stated. “These materials can help scientists identify the types of molecules that developed in early star systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study connects to ongoing research about how small icy bodies may preserve organic compounds. Previous investigations have documented cryovolcanism on worlds such as Enceladus, Europa, and Pluto, but this marks the first time interstellar objects have been included in this category. The findings raise questions about how widespread such processes might be across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to examine new images of 3I/ATLAS as they refine their models. The ongoing study of the comet contributes to a growing catalogue of interstellar objects and their potential implications for planetary formation and chemistry in our solar system.</p>
