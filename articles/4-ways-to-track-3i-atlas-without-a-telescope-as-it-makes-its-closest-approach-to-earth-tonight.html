      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth Tonight</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS makes its closest approach to Earth tonight, December 19, at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT). The comet, discovered on July 1, 2023, by astronomers using the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), will pass at a distance of approximately 273 million kilometres from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar visitor to enter our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Authorities encourage the public to track the comet's journey as it moves further away from the sun and ultimately back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2023, at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 273 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the sun:</strong> October 31, 2023, at 210 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Next significant event:</strong> Flyby of Jupiter on March 12, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, during a survey by the ATLAS telescopes. It came closest to the sun on October 31, passing within 210 million kilometres. The comet is now making its closest approach to Earth tonight, December 19, at 1 a.m. EST. Following this, it will continue its journey out of the solar system and will fly by Jupiter in 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe an interstellar object,” said a NASA spokesperson. “While it may not be visible to the naked eye, there are many ways to track its progress.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to our understanding of interstellar objects, which are rare visitors to our solar system. The previous interstellar comets, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have prompted significant scientific interest regarding their origins and compositions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After tonight's closest approach, 3I/ATLAS will continue to move away from the sun and Earth, eventually disappearing from view. Observers can still track its trajectory using various online resources and tools in the coming weeks.</p>
