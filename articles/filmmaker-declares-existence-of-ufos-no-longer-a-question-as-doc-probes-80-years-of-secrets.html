      <h2>Filmmaker declares existence of UFOs 'no longer a question' — as doc probes 80 years of secrets</h2>

<p>Filmmaker Dan Farah has claimed that the existence of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) is "no longer a question," as he prepares for the release of his documentary, “The Age of Disclosure,” which investigates an alleged 80-year global cover-up regarding extraterrestrial life. The film is set to premiere in select theaters in New York, Washington DC, and Los Angeles on November 21, 2025.</p>

<p>Farah's statements highlight ongoing concerns about government transparency and the implications of advanced extraterrestrial technology. He asserts that the U.S. government is engaged in a "secret Cold War race" to reverse engineer alien technology, while many officials, including members of Congress, have been kept uninformed. The documentary features interviews with high-ranking officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who discuss the potential national security threats posed by unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Documentary title: “The Age of Disclosure”</li>
  <li>Release date: November 21, 2025</li>
  <li>Premiere locations: New York, Washington DC, Los Angeles</li>
  <li>Director: Dan Farah</li>
  <li>Number of government officials interviewed: 34</li>
  <li>Notable interviewee: Secretary of State Marco Rubio</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2025, “The Age of Disclosure” premiered at the SXSW film festival. Over the past three years, Farah conducted interviews with 34 senior members of the U.S. government, military, and intelligence community to gather insights on UAPs and governmental secrecy. The documentary aims to shed light on the alleged cover-up and the implications of advanced technologies on national security.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every single person I interviewed made it very clear that it was no longer a question of whether this was a real situation. It’s a very real situation,” said Dan Farah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come,” warned Jay Stratton, a former Defense Intelligence Agency senior executive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The fear here is that if another nation wins this race, it could really change the lay of the land in terms of power,” Farah stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding UFOs has intensified in recent years, particularly as former officials and whistleblowers have come forward with claims of government secrecy regarding UAP sightings and encounters. The concept of reverse engineering alien technology has emerged as a focal point in national security debates, drawing comparisons to historical projects like the Manhattan Project.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>With the documentary set for release, public interest in the government's handling of UAP information is expected to grow. Farah anticipates that the film will prompt further discussions about transparency and the potential for future disclosures from government officials.</p>
