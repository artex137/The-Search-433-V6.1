      <h2>Could interstellar object 31-ATLAS have ‘slammed on brakes in black swan event’?</h2>

<p>Mysterious comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual behaviour since its discovery in July, with reports suggesting it may have performed a controlled manoeuvre as it approaches the Sun. The comet is expected to exit the solar system, but claims of its potential alien origin have stirred debate among scientists.</p>

<p>This matter has drawn attention as astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has proposed that 3I/ATLAS may have deployed braking thrust, indicating possible intelligent control. However, many experts, including Dr. Mark Norris, have expressed skepticism regarding these claims, suggesting more conventional explanations for the comet's behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was spotted in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb has suggested it may be exhibiting controlled manoeuvring.</li>
    <li>Dr. Mark Norris claims the comet's behaviour can be explained by natural phenomena.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass out of the solar system soon.</li>
    <li>The International Asteroid Warning Network is tracking the comet's path.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was first observed, prompting interest in its trajectory and composition. By September, images showed a change in the comet's tail orientation, raising theories of possible intelligent control. Dr. Loeb highlighted this change in a blog post, suggesting it could indicate a black swan event. Meanwhile, Dr. Norris has reiterated that there is no current evidence supporting the notion of alien intervention.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact that it has an anti-tail is not shocking,” said Dr. Mark Norris. “It’s interesting, but it’s not like proof of anything. It’s normal.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Avi Loeb noted, “If the object is an alien spacecraft slowing down, then this change from anti-tail to tail would be entirely expected near perihelion.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time a comet has sparked speculation about alien life. In 2017, the first interstellar comet, Oumuamua, also prompted theories of an artificial origin. Experts have since clarified that both comets exhibit behaviour consistent with natural processes rather than extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. Ongoing scientific analysis will focus on its trajectory and composition, with researchers eager to understand more about the characteristics of interstellar objects.</p>
