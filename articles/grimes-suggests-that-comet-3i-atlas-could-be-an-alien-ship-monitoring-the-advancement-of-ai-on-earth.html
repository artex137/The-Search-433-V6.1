      <h2>Grimes suggests that comet 3I/ATLAS could be an alien ship monitoring the advancement of AI on Earth</h2>

<p>On December 3, 2025, singer Grimes has raised eyebrows by suggesting that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be an extraterrestrial probe observing humanity's development of artificial intelligence. This claim follows statements made by astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University, who has also commented on the unusual characteristics of the comet, discovered in July 2025.</p>

<p>The comet has attracted significant attention due to its peculiar behavior and the ongoing monitoring efforts by the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN). Authorities have confirmed that while 3I/ATLAS poses no threat of collision, its unique features have sparked debates about its origins, with some experts considering the possibility of it being artificial in nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date Discovered:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Period:</strong> Until January 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> November 11, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Campaign Start:</strong> November 27, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Score on Loeb's Scale:</strong> 6 out of 10</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The following events outline the significant developments concerning comet 3I/ATLAS:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>July 2025:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS system.</li>
    <li><strong>November 11, 2025:</strong> The comet reaches perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, and is observed intact.</li>
    <li><strong>November 27, 2025:</strong> An observation campaign begins, marking the eighth of its kind by IAWN since 2017.</li>
    <li><strong>November 29, 2025:</strong> Grimes posts her hypothesis about the comet being an extraterrestrial probe on social media.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Advanced civilizations could be evaluating whether humanity is ready to join a galactic federation or whether it represents a risk,” Grimes wrote on X.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Thrusters directed towards the Sun could explain the acceleration observed after perihelion,” said Avi Loeb, referencing the comet's unusual acceleration.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS has echoed similar debates sparked by previous interstellar objects such as ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. While these objects generated speculation about extraterrestrial origins, none have received a maximum score on Loeb's evaluation scale. Most astronomers classify 3I/ATLAS as a natural interstellar body, attributing its peculiarities to poorly understood natural processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>IAWN will continue to monitor the comet over the next two months, focusing on its trajectory, composition, and potential anomalies. The ongoing observations serve to gather scientific data and test protocols for monitoring near-Earth objects.</p>
