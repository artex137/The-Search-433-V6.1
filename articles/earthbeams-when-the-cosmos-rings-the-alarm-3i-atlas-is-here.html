      <h2>Earthbeams? When the Cosmos Rings The Alarm: 3I/ATLAS Is Here</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is currently passing through our solar system, having been discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope. The comet is on a hyperbolic trajectory, reaching speeds of around 60 kilometers per second and is expected to make its closest approach to Earth at approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million kilometers) in December 2025. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this celestial event.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it represents only the third known interstellar comet to enter our solar system, prompting scientists to assess our planetary defense capabilities. While the comet poses no immediate threat, its unusual characteristics challenge current understandings of celestial objects and their origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 60 kilometers per second (216,000 kilometers per hour)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 2025, at 1.8 astronomical units (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Carbon dioxide-dominated coma, with a ratio of roughly eight to one compared to water</li>
    <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> Active, releasing gas and dust</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope. Following its discovery, scientists confirmed the comet's hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its interstellar origins. As of now, it is approaching its closest point to the Sun in late October 2025 and is expected to pass Earth in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact that such an object is passing through at all is enough to register on the planetary-defense radar,” said a scientist involved in the observations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Even though the comet poses no immediate threat, studying it offers lessons in both preparedness and humility,” another expert noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever observed, with previous examples highlighting the rarity of such celestial visitors. Current planetary-defense systems are predominantly designed to detect and track objects originating from within our solar system, such as asteroids and typical comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and Earth. They will focus on changes in the comet's tail and coma, as well as any unexpected behavior or emissions that could provide insights into its formation and the environment from which it originated.</p>
