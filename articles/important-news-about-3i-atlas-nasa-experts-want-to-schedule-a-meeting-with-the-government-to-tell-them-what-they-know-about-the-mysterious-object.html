      <h2>NASA Experts Seek Meeting with Government on Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has contacted parts of the US government to arrange a meeting to discuss the interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS. The comet, discovered by the ATLAS telescope, remains unidentified, with its nature and origin still unknown. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This meeting is significant as it may provide answers to ongoing questions about the comet's large size and high speed, which have led to speculation regarding a possible alien origin. NASA and the European Space Agency have dismissed these theories, asserting that it is a natural, albeit unusual, comet. However, the request for a meeting has prompted further discussion among experts and lawmakers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered by ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>NASA has contacted the US government for a meeting.</li>
    <li>Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna wrote to NASA on October 31.</li>
    <li>No briefing on the comet has been provided to the House of Representatives.</li>
    <li>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has raised the possibility of an alien origin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 31, Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna sent a letter to acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy, urging the release of specific records, images, and data regarding 3I/ATLAS. Following this, NASA initiated contact with parts of the US government to arrange a meeting to discuss the comet.</p>

<p>A government spokesperson confirmed that no briefing on the comet has been given to the House of Representatives. This indicates a growing interest in the object as it gains attention from both the scientific community and lawmakers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This information is of great importance in advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,” said Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna in her letter to NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We’re interested in seeing the images and I’m sure this will be one of many objects that we’ll be looking at as technology advances, and we’ll see more in the near future,” a government spokesperson told DefenseScoop.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Regarding the possible implications of 3I/ATLAS, I consider it a possible black swan event. It is most likely a natural comet, but its anomalies imply that we should consider a technological origin because of the great implications it would have for humanity,” said Harvard professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has raised questions about the nature of interstellar objects and their interaction with our solar system. This follows a trend of increasing interest in unidentified objects and phenomena in space, prompting calls for transparency and information from agencies like NASA.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to provide more information in the coming weeks as the comet moves away from the Sun, allowing for detailed observations that may clarify its nature.</p>
