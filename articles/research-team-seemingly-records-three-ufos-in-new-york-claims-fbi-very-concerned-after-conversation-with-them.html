<p>The investigation has attracted attention from the FBI and other federal agencies. According to John Tedesco of Nightcrawler Research, during an interview on NewsNation’s “Reality Check,” federal agencies have shown serious interest in their findings, indicating ongoing communication between the team and the FBI.</p>
