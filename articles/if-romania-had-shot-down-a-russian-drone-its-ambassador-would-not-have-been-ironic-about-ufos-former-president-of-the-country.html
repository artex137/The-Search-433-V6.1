      <h2>If Romania had shot down a Russian drone, its ambassador would not have been ironic about UFOs - former president of the country</h2>

<p>Traian Basescu, the former president of Romania, has commented on the recent incident involving a Russian drone, stating that the Russian Embassy's mockery of Romania reflects the country's handling of the situation. The remarks come in the wake of a Russian drone flying into Romanian airspace on September 13, 2023, which prompted significant security concerns.</p>

<p>Basescu has asserted that Romania must demonstrate a strong commitment to protecting its airspace and territory. He emphasized that if Romania had taken decisive action against the drone, the response from the Russian ambassador would have been different. The former president's statements highlight ongoing tensions regarding airspace security in the region and the need for Romania to prepare for potential future threats from Russia.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 13, 2023, a Russian drone entered Romanian airspace, prompting fighter jets to intercept it. The drone was reportedly tracked before it disappeared from radar. In response to the incident, Poland raised its aviation and closed the airport in Lublin as a precaution.</p>
<p>The following day, on September 14, the Romanian Foreign Ministry condemned the drone's flight, calling it a provocation. Romania summoned the Russian ambassador to express its strong protest against the incident. The ambassador dismissed the protest, claiming the drone was a UFO and accusing Ukraine of provocation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I'm afraid the irony of the Russian embassy is based on our way of doing things. Imagine the Russian embassy if we had shot down a Russian drone. Do you think the Russian ambassador would still be ironic?" 
    <strong>– Traian Basescu, former president of Romania</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "When it comes to security, there is nothing more important than to prove to those who are checking you that you are able to protect your airspace." 
    <strong>– Traian Basescu</strong>

Romania has faced increasing challenges in ensuring the safety and integrity of its borders amid ongoing military activities in the region. Basescu's comments reflect broader concerns about the country's defense capabilities and preparedness in the face of potential threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
