      <h2>'Dorito' shaped aircraft spotted flying over Area 51 at night sparks UFO fears</h2>

<p>An explorer has captured footage of an unusual aircraft near Area 51 in southern Nevada on January 14, 2023. The aircraft, described as 'Dorito' shaped, has raised concerns about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the region, which is known for its association with alleged alien activity and secret military operations.</p>

<p>The sighting matters because it connects to a history of reported UFO encounters in the area, and it has drawn attention from both enthusiasts and authorities. Area 51 is home to a highly classified U.S. Air Force base, and the nature of the aircraft remains uncertain.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: January 14, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Near Area 51, Nevada</li>
    <li>Time of sighting: Approximately 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.</li>
    <li>Witness: Anders Otteson, backpacker and videographer</li>
    <li>Type of aircraft: Described as 'Dorito' shaped</li>
    <li>Previous similar sightings: Reported in 2014 by Jeff Templin and Steve Douglass</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At around 1 a.m. on January 14, Anders Otteson began hearing jet engine sounds while camping near Area 51. Shortly thereafter, he spotted what he initially thought was a B-2 stealth bomber. Closer to 3 a.m., he observed a second aircraft that he described as having a shape similar to an equilateral triangle, later calling it 'Dorito' shaped.</p>

<p>Otteson documented his experience in a YouTube video, noting the peculiar shape of the aircraft and its low flyover. He expressed uncertainty about whether it was indeed a B-2 or something different.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It's hard to say conclusively what we're looking at, but in relation to all the other recent Dorito sightings... I think we have something interesting here,” said Otteson in his video.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Given the resolution of this photo, we can’t even tell if it is a military aircraft, much less an Air Force one,” said U.S. Air Force spokesperson Jennifer Cassidy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I do not know,” said FAA spokesperson Alison Duquette when asked about the aircraft's identity.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has long been a focal point for UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theories regarding extraterrestrial life. Previous sightings of similar 'Dorito' shaped objects have occurred, notably in 2014, but the nature of these aircraft remains largely unexplained. The U.S. military has often been reticent in confirming or denying the existence of such aircraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the sighting have not been announced, and it remains unclear if any official inquiries will take place. The U.S. Air Force and FAA have not provided further information on the incident or the aircraft involved.</p>
