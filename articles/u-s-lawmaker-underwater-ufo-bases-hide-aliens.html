      <h2>U.S. Lawmaker: Underwater UFO Bases Hide Aliens</h2>

<p>U.S. Representative Tim Burchett has claimed that there are 5 to 6 underwater UFO bases near the American coasts, suggesting that extraterrestrial life forms might be hiding there. Burchett, a member of the House Oversight Committee, made the remarks during a street interview with documentary filmmaker Red Panda Koala on September 28, 2025.</p>

<p>This statement has drawn significant attention and controversy, as it raises questions about the existence of such bases and the credibility of the evidence presented. Experts have criticized Burchett’s claims for lacking scientific validation and peer-reviewed data. The ongoing discussion highlights the broader public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena and the government's response to such claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Burchett claims 5 to 6 underwater UFO bases exist.</li>
    <li>He cites reports from U.S. Navy personnel regarding unidentified vehicles.</li>
    <li>The claims were made during an interview on September 28, 2025.</li>
    <li>Video of the interview has over 1.9 million views on social media.</li>
    <li>Experts have noted a lack of peer-reviewed evidence supporting Burchett's assertions.</li>
    <li>Dr. Michael Salla has suggested specific locations for these bases, including the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 28, 2025, Rep. Tim Burchett made claims about underwater UFO bases during an interview with Red Panda Koala. He stated that highly advanced extraterrestrial civilizations might be hiding in the deep sea, referencing reports from Navy personnel about unidentified vehicles. On September 19, Dr. Michael Salla discussed potential locations for these bases, specifically mentioning the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center near the Bahamas. Earlier, on September 9, footage of an unidentified aerial object that continued flying after being hit by a missile was released by Congress.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Highly advanced extraterrestrial life forms or civilizations might currently be hiding in Earth’s deep seas,” Burchett said during the interview.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>Dr. Michael Salla stated, “Near the Bahamas lies the ‘Tongue of the Ocean,’ where the seabed plunges abruptly to a depth of approximately 3,000 feet (914 meters). Many people have reported sightings of UFOs and underwater vehicles there.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time UFO sightings and claims of extraterrestrial life have gained public attention. The U.S. government has been under scrutiny for its handling of unidentified aerial phenomena, with increasing calls for transparency regarding military encounters. Burchett's recent remarks underscore ongoing debates about the nature of these sightings and the need for credible evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As public interest in UFOs continues to grow, further investigations and discussions may arise. The credibility of claims made by lawmakers like Burchett will likely depend on the availability of scientific data and peer-reviewed research to support such assertions.</p>
