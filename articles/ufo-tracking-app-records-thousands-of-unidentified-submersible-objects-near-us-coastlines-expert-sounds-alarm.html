      <h2>UFO-tracking app records thousands of 'Unidentified Submersible Objects' near US coastlines; expert sounds alarm</h2>

<p>A popular UFO-reporting app, Enigma, has logged thousands of mysterious underwater sightings, termed Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs), raising national security concerns among experts. The app has received over 30,000 reports of unidentified aerial and anomalous phenomena since its launch in late 2022, with more than 9,000 sightings occurring within 10 miles of US shorelines or major bodies of water.</p>

<p>This surge in reported USO activity has prompted experts to warn about potential security threats. Retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet stated that these encounters could have “world-changing” implications if verified. He expressed concern that unidentified objects are entering US waters without proper government acknowledgment or response.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enigma app has recorded over 30,000 sightings since late 2022.</li>
    <li>More than 9,000 sightings occurred within 10 miles of US coastlines.</li>
    <li>Over 500 sightings were reported within five miles of shore.</li>
    <li>California has logged 389 USO reports; Florida has 306.</li>
    <li>Notable report includes cellphone video of glowing green lights underwater.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Enigma app launched in late 2022, allowing users to report sightings of unidentified aerial and anomalous phenomena. Since then, reports have surged, particularly along the US coastlines. In March 2024, retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet released a report highlighting the implications of these sightings for national security.</p>

<p>Gallaudet noted that the Pentagon has verified video footage showing objects transitioning from air to sea without impact, raising concerns about U.S. maritime security. He emphasized that these capabilities could jeopardize national safety.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Any object detected underwater that cannot be immediately identified or explained qualifies as a USO,” according to Enigma.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena,” wrote Gallaudet in his report.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This rise in reported USO activity follows a broader pattern of unexplained technology sightings across various domains, including air, sea, and space. Gallaudet's report indicates a concerning trend where credible observers and military instrumentation have detected objects displaying capabilities beyond current human technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into these sightings are ongoing, with experts pressing for more transparency from government agencies regarding their findings related to USOs and other anomalous phenomena.</p>
