      <h2>New Snapshots of Comet 3I/ATLAS Highlight a Dazzling Glow and Two Separate Tails</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, continues to capture attention as it approaches Earth for a flyby on Friday, December 19, 2025. The comet, traveling at speeds of 153,000 miles per hour, has been observed in new images from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice).</p>

<p>This latest data is significant for astronomers who are studying the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. The comet's bright blue glow and the emergence of two distinct tails have generated excitement within the scientific community as they prepare for more observations leading into next year.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to pass Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is currently traveling at 153,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>The comet was recorded 178 million miles from Earth on November 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be about 168 million miles away.</li>
    <li>The comet passed Mars on October 3, 2025, at a distance of 18 million miles.</li>
    <li>Images were captured by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and ESA’s Juice on November 30 and November 2, respectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. Since then, astronomers have monitored its trajectory and behavior. On November 2, 2023, the Juice spacecraft captured an image showing hints of two tails. Later, on November 30, Hubble provided a vivid image of the comet's blue glow.</p>
<p>The comet's closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at which point it will be observed closely by astronomers from various locations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is unusually bright for a comet, possibly due to its lack of a dust mantle,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This allows it to maintain a blue-green hue, likely caused by gases being ejected from its body.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as an interstellar visitor, distinguishing itself from typical comets. Most comets develop a dust mantle that affects their brightness and color. The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is under close scrutiny as it moves through the Solar System, providing valuable data about interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>More observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS are expected in the upcoming months as other telescopes join the effort. Astronomers will continue to track the comet's approach and behavior as it nears Earth.</p>
