      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas will have its trajectory altered by Jupiter in rare encounter in 2026</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, confirmed as the third object from outside the Solar System, will have its trajectory significantly modified after a close encounter with Jupiter in March 2026. A study published by Indian Estudo on November 28 indicates that Jupiter's gravity will divert the comet towards the constellation of Gemini. The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it provides a rare opportunity for astronomers to study primordial material from another star system. The study, conducted by the Laboratório of Pesquisa Física in Ahmedabad, is awaiting peer review but already highlights the decisive influence of Jupiter's gravity on the comet's path.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest point to the Sun): October 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter: March 9-22, 2026</li>
    <li>Distance from Jupiter at closest approach: approximately 0.5 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter of the comet: between 1 and 3 km</li>
    <li>Current speed: approximately 40 km/s relative to the Sun</li>
    <li>Composition: rich in carbon monoxide and complex organic molecules</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in 2024 by the Atlas system in Hawaii. It has traveled through the constellation region of Sagittarius about 100 years ago before entering the inner Solar System. The comet will reach perihelion in October 2025, followed by its closest approach to Earth in December.</p>

<p>Between March 9 and 22, 2026, 3I/Atlas will pass close to Jupiter, where its trajectory will be altered due to the planet's gravitational influence. The Juno spacecraft, in polar orbit around Jupiter, will be well-positioned to capture images and spectral data of the comet during this encounter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The interaction should change the comet’s hyperbolic speed, reducing or increasing its orbital energy,” according to the Indian Estudo report.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This event represents a rare opportunity to study primordial material from another star system,” the researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is one of the few known interstellar objects, providing unique insights into the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from outside our Solar System. The ongoing monitoring of the comet by observatories worldwide aims to refine predictions about the gravitational effects of Jupiter.</p>

<p>Data collected until 2026 will be used to compare real behavior with theoretical models, enhancing our understanding of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations of 3I/Atlas will continue until its encounter with Jupiter in 2026, allowing researchers to gather data and refine predictions about its trajectory and behavior.</p>
