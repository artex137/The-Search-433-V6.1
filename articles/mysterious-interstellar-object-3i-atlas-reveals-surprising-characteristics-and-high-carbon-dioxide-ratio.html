      <h2>Mysterious Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Reveals Surprising Characteristics and High Carbon Dioxide Ratio</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has garnered significant attention since its discovery in early July 2023. This object represents only the third known instance from beyond our solar system and is currently being studied by a range of advanced telescopes, including NASA's Hubble, SPHEREx, TESS, and the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<p>The examination of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it could provide insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. As researchers analyze its unique characteristics, including an unusually high carbon dioxide to water ratio, they hope to better understand the object and its origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Detection Date: Early July 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at initial detection: Six astronomical units</li>
    <li>Highest carbon dioxide to water ratio recorded in any comet</li>
    <li>Instruments used: NASA's Hubble, SPHEREx, TESS, James Webb Space Telescope</li>
    <li>Potential close flybys: Jupiter, Mars, and Venus</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was initially detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) months before its confirmed discovery. Observations revealed that the object exhibited brightness and activity while located six astronomical units from the Sun, a distance greater than most comets at similar stages.</p>

<p>In a groundbreaking report from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, researchers noted a "teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust" surrounding the comet's icy nucleus. However, unlike typical comets, 3I/ATLAS does not have a well-defined tail, prompting further inquiry into its unique properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard, has speculated that the object may be of extraterrestrial origin.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the limited knowledge about interstellar objects. Prior instances have provided little information on their formation and behavior, making this comet a focal point for ongoing research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, researchers are preparing for its close flybys of Jupiter, Mars, and Venus. Loeb has recommended that NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter observe the object when it comes within two million miles of Mars. NASA's Juno probe may also have an opportunity to intercept 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter.</p>
