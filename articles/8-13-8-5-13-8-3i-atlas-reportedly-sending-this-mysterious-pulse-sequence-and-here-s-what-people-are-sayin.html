      <h2>3I/ATLAS Sends Mysterious Pulse Sequence</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, is reportedly sending a mysterious pulse sequence identified as 8 • 13 • 8 • 5 • 13 • 8. The signal has been detected across a distance of 15,000 km, according to reports from an X handle. There have been no injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may represent the first deliberate signal ever received from an interstellar visitor. Authorities and scientists are analyzing the signal, which has been linked to the Fibonacci pattern, a mathematical sequence prevalent in nature. The frequency of the signal, 1420 MHz, is recognized as the interstellar calling channel used in Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Detected Pulse Sequence: 8 • 13 • 8 • 5 • 13 • 8</li>
    <li>Frequency: 1420 MHz</li>
    <li>Distance of Detection: 15,000 km</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: October 29, 2025 (1.8 astronomical units)</li>
    <li>Brightness: Magnitude 12 to 14</li>
    <li>Expected Reappearance: December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawaii. On October 13, 2025, filmmaker David Sereda reported unusual light emissions from the object. The recent pulse sequence was reported via an X handle, indicating a potential deliberate transmission.</p>

<p>Scientists have noted that the pulses are stable and deliberate, unaffected by the object’s rotation. This suggests a controlled transmission rather than a natural source. The message has been decoded as: "Observe. Prepare. Understand. The Gate Awaits."</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If confirmed, this could mark the first deliberate signal ever received from an interstellar visitor,” the X handle stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>David Sereda claimed that the pulses coincided with the 108th anniversary of the Miracle of the Sun at Fátima.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as a one-time visitor to our Solar System, having been confirmed as interstellar by four major space observatories. The object is moving on a hyperbolic path, suggesting it originated from another star system. Its unusual activity includes ejecting powerful jets of gas and dust, which differ from typical comets.</p>

<p>The excitement surrounding 3I/ATLAS is tempered by misinformation and speculation regarding its nature and signals.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study the signal and the object as it approaches Earth. Observations are expected during its closest approach on October 29, 2025. The comet is anticipated to reappear in December 2025, providing an opportunity for further analysis of its composition and activity.</p>
