      <h2>NASA Releases New Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by several spacecraft as it passed by Mars in early October. The images were taken during a 43-day government shutdown, and the agency has now made them available to the public. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object detected in the solar system. Researchers use the data to study the comet's composition and characteristics, providing valuable insights into the nature of interstellar visitors. NASA continues to monitor the comet with various instruments, including the James Webb Space Telescope, which is set to observe it in December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet passed as close as 19 million miles from Mars in early October.</li>
    <li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN orbiter captured images of the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet's core is estimated to be between 427 meters and 1,600 meters in diameter.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur around December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 273 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass Jupiter in spring 2026 before leaving the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, 3I/ATLAS was first detected by ATLAS in Chile. In early October, the comet made its closest approach to Mars, allowing several NASA spacecraft to capture significant images. The release of the images occurred on November 19, 2023, during a press conference where NASA officials discussed the findings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are so happy to have our incredible fleet of NASA science spacecraft all across the solar system,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This object is a comet,” stated Amit Kshatriya, NASA associate administrator. “It looks and behaves like a comet… and all evidence points to it being a comet.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it’s a fascinating and rare opportunity,” said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, NASA’s acting astrophysics division director.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third documented interstellar object, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of these objects provides insights into the composition and dynamics of materials beyond the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS with various spacecraft, including the James Webb Space Telescope in December. The comet will be monitored as it approaches Earth and later as it travels beyond the solar system.</p>
