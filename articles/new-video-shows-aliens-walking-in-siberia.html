      <h2>New video shows aliens walking in Siberia</h2>

<p>Two new videos have emerged online depicting what appears to be aliens walking in the snow in the Irkutsk region of Siberia. The footage, recorded in a remote area, follows reports of strange lights flashing in the skies over Bayanday and Irkutsk two days prior. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The recent videos have drawn significant attention and sparked discussions about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the region. Authorities, including local military officials, have classified the incident, which has led to an influx of calls to rescue departments from concerned residents. UFO expert Mike Cohen has characterized the event as significant, likening it to a "Roswell-sized event" in Russia.</p>
