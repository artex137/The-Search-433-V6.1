      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-17 11:46 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS major astronomical event on December 19</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 274 million kilometres. The comet, which was first detected on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, does not pose any danger to Earth, as it is significantly farther away than the Moon.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>This event is significant as it marks a rare opportunity for astronomers and skywatchers to observe an interstellar object. NASA has initiated a solar system-wide observation campaign to study the comet, utilizing various telescopes and spacecraft to gather data that may enhance understanding of the origins of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event date:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest distance:</strong> 274 million kilometres from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope used for discovery:</strong> ATLAS, located in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Observing spacecraft:</strong> Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, SPHEREx</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> Approximately 30.6 million kilometres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, the Hubble Space Telescope observed the comet. In August 2023, both the James Webb Space Telescope and SPHEREx captured images of the comet. The comet made a close pass by Mars in the fall of 2023, where NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took detailed images and data. The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023, before continuing its journey out of the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This observation campaign is unprecedented. We are gathering data from multiple locations to understand this interstellar visitor better,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. Previous interstellar visitors have provided valuable insights into the composition and dynamics of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. The study of 3I/ATLAS offers a unique opportunity to compare it with comets that originated within our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach on December 19, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to move beyond the orbit of Jupiter in spring 2026, continuing its journey back to interstellar space. NASA will continue to analyze data collected from various observations to enhance understanding of the comet's characteristics.</p>
