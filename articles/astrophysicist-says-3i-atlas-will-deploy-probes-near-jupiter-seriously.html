      <h2>Astrophysicist Says 3I/ATLAS Will Deploy Probes Near Jupiter. Seriously.</h2>

<p>Astrophysicist Avi Loeb has claimed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Jupiter in March 2024, raising speculation about its trajectory and possible technological implications. The comet will pass Earth at a distance of 170 million miles next month before continuing inward and nearing Jupiter.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it challenges conventional understandings of interstellar objects. While most scientists view 3I/ATLAS as a typical comet composed of ice and dust, Loeb suggests that its trajectory may be deliberate, possibly indicating a mission to deliver technology to Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass Earth at a distance of 170 million miles in December 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to approach Jupiter in March 2024, coming within 53 million miles.</li>
    <li>Loeb claims the comet's trajectory appears "finely tuned" and may involve non-gravitational acceleration.</li>
    <li>The comet's close pass by the Sun last month provided it with additional speed.</li>
    <li>NASA's Juno probe is being suggested by Loeb to observe any unexpected satellites around Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected as it entered the solar system. In December 2023, it will pass Earth at a distance of 170 million miles. Following this, it will continue on a path towards Jupiter, where it is expected to arrive in March 2024.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to these events, Loeb has publicly expressed his theories regarding the comet's trajectory, suggesting it may be part of a deliberate mission rather than a natural occurrence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS looks finely tuned, possibly even the work of thrusters,” said Avi Loeb regarding the comet’s path towards Jupiter.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has garnered attention since it was first identified due to its interstellar origins. The scientific community largely agrees that it is a regular comet; however, Loeb's theories have sparked debate about the nature of interstellar objects and the possibility of advanced civilizations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its close encounters with Earth and Jupiter, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory. The potential observations by NASA's Juno probe in March 2024 could provide further insights into the comet and its characteristics.</p>
