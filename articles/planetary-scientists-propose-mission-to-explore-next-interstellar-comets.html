      <h2>Planetary Scientists Propose Mission to Explore Next Interstellar Comets</h2>

<p>Planetary researchers at Southwest Research Institute have completed a study proposing a spacecraft mission to explore interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which could provide significant insights into objects originating beyond our Solar System. The study validates the mission concept, indicating that the spacecraft could have intercepted and observed 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>This mission is important as it represents the first feasible opportunity for close exploration of bodies formed in other star systems. The researchers aim to gather unprecedented data about the composition, structure, and properties of interstellar comets, which could enhance understanding of solid body formation processes in different star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study conducted by Southwest Research Institute.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was captured in an image by Hubble on July 21, 2025, at a distance of 446 million km from Earth.</li>
    <li>First interstellar comet detected was 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>Scientists estimate 10,000 interstellar objects pass inside Neptune's orbit each year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, 1I/‘Oumuamua became the first interstellar comet detected in the Solar System. This was followed by the discovery of 2I/Borisov in 2019. In 2023, 3I/ATLAS was recognized as the third interstellar object to enter the Solar System, garnering worldwide attention.</p>
<p>The recent study from Southwest Research Institute outlines the potential for a spacecraft to fly by 3I/ATLAS, detailing the mission's objectives and the feasibility of its design.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These new kinds of objects offer humankind the first feasible opportunity to closely explore bodies formed in other star systems,” said lead author Dr. Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at Southwest Research Institute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is within the interceptable range of the mission we designed, and the scientific observations made during such a flyby would be groundbreaking,” said Dr. Matthew Freeman from Southwest Research Institute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The very encouraging thing about the appearance of 3I/ATLAS is that it further strengthens the case that our study for an interstellar comet mission made,” said Dr. Mark Tapley, an orbital mechanics expert at Southwest Research Institute.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar comets has evolved since 2017, with each new find providing a unique opportunity to study celestial bodies from outside our Solar System. The recent study emphasizes the growing interest and potential for missions targeting these objects, as previous technologies have already been successful in similar space explorations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to further develop mission trajectory options and refine the spacecraft design based on the findings from this study. Future steps include potential mission planning and seeking funding for the proposed interstellar comet mission.</p>
