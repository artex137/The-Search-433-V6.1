      <h2>3I/ATLAS Post-Perihelion Update: Nickel Spotted—What Does This Mean for Us?</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has completed its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on 29 October 2025 and has revealed the presence of nickel vapour in its coma, according to recent spectroscopic measurements. The comet passed its perihelion at a distance of approximately 1.356 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS may have originated from a star system with a different chemical composition than our own. Scientists are studying the comet closely as it offers a unique opportunity to learn about the formation of planets around other stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet passed the Sun at a distance of about 1.356 AU.</li>
    <li>Nickel vapour and cyanogen gas have been detected in its coma.</li>
    <li>The comet is actively releasing water ice, confirmed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Key observation windows are scheduled for 3 November 2025 and 19 December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been on a journey through our Solar System since its discovery. On 29 October 2025, it reached its perihelion, marking the closest point to the Sun in its trajectory. Following this event, scientists have conducted spectroscopic measurements, revealing the presence of nickel vapour in the comet's coma.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away from the Sun, it continues to display active behaviours, including the release of water ice and the presence of a carbon dioxide-rich coma. Observations from facilities like the Gemini South Observatory have confirmed these findings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of nickel hints that 3I/ATLAS may have formed in a star system with a different chemical composition than our own,” a spokesperson for the research team stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This comet gives us a rare glimpse of material from another star system,” said an astronomer involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare visitors to our Solar System, providing valuable insights into the chemistry of distant star systems. 3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its unique composition but also for its dynamic behaviour, which is uncommon among comets from our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. Observations on 3 November 2025 and 19 December 2025 will be critical for understanding its composition and behaviour further. These findings could refine existing theories on planet formation beyond our Solar System.</p>
