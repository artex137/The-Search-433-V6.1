      <h2>3I/Atlas, Third Extrasolar Object, May Disintegrate at October Perihelion</h2>

<p>Astronomers at the ATLAS system have detected the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025, at the RÃ­o Hurtado observatory in Chile. The comet, the third confirmed to originate outside the Solar System, is expected to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun, near Mars' orbit. Authorities have raised concerns that the comet may disintegrate due to intense solar radiation.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Current observations show early activity, with gas emissions detected from the comet, which may help scientists understand its structure and origins. The European Space Agency and NASA are coordinating tracking efforts through various probes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of detection: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: RÃ­o Hurtado observatory, Chile</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at perihelion: 1.4 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Velocity: 58 km/s</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus diameter: between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: exceeds 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 1.8 astronomical units in December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers at the RÃ­o Hurtado observatory in Chile detected 3I/ATLAS. Observations from the Nordic Optical telescope between July and September revealed dust and ice jets. The comet is expected to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025, which raises concerns about potential fragmentation due to solar radiation exposure.</p>
<p>On October 27, 2025, 3I/ATLAS aligned with the Sun, comets Lemmon and R2 SWAN, and Venus, aiding studies of its dynamic interactions. Continuous monitoring will occur despite a solar conjunction on October 21, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The proximity of 3I/ATLAS to the Sun puts its nucleus at risk of fragmentation,” said a representative from the European Space Agency.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed, following 1I/Ê»Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique characteristics, including a high carbon dioxide composition and extreme negative polarization, distinguish it from local comets. Observations of its early activity may reshape current models of cometary formation and behavior in exoplanetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Post-perihelion observations in December 2025 will provide further insights into the comet's integrity and structure. Scientists will analyze data to understand the effects of solar radiation on its composition and potential fragmentation.</p>
