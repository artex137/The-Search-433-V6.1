      <h2>Today in History - September 19: The purported alien abduction that began it all</h2>

<p>On September 19, 1961, Barney and Betty Hill reported an encounter with an unidentified flying object while driving on a quiet road in New Hampshire. The couple experienced significant memory gaps after the incident, which they believed involved an alien abduction.</p>

<p>The Hills' account has sparked interest in UFO phenomena and has influenced popular culture since the incident. Authorities and researchers have examined their claims, leading to ongoing discussions about the nature of such encounters and the psychological factors involved.</p>
