      <h2>More than 8,000 UFO sightings in US since 2022 - with three military air bases buzzed</h2>

<p>More than 8,000 UFO sightings have been reported in the United States since 2022, with many incidents occurring near military bases in California, New York, and Arizona. A report from the crowd-sourced app Enigma has detailed that 422 of these sightings involved metallic orbs observed between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. within five miles of military installations.</p>

<p>This surge in sightings has prompted interest from authorities, particularly the Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which is currently investigating 757 reports made between May 2023 and June 2024. Of these, 21 have been classified as genuine mysteries with no clear explanation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>More than 8,000 UFO sightings reported since 2022.</li>
  <li>422 sightings of metallic orbs near military bases.</li>
  <li>Key military sites include Fort Hamilton (New York), Papago (Arizona), and Los Angeles Air Force Base (California).</li>
  <li>Orbs are now more commonly reported than traditional flying saucers.</li>
  <li>AARO is investigating 757 UFO reports from May 2023 to June 2024.</li>
  <li>21 reports have been classified as genuine mysteries with no explanation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since 2022, the number of reported UFO sightings in the U.S. has exceeded 8,000. A significant portion of these sightings has occurred at night, particularly between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. near military installations. Analysts have noted a shift from classic disc-shaped UFOs to more modern reports of orb-shaped unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).</p>
<p>In May 2023, the Pentagon's AARO began investigating a new wave of sightings, leading to the current examination of 757 reports. As of June 2024, 21 of these incidents remain classified as mysteries.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While classic disc-shaped UFOs dominated mid-20th Century sightings, orb-shaped UAP have emerged as one of the most frequently reported modern phenomena,” the Enigma report stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Despite official statements and competing theories, their origin and purpose remain unknown,” the report continued.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The rise in reported UFO sightings aligns with increased public interest and government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. Previous incidents have led to various theories regarding the nature and origin of these sightings, ranging from surveillance devices to atmospheric anomalies.</p>
<p>Analysts have observed that orbs typically lack visible propulsion systems and often appear in restricted airspace, particularly near sensitive military and nuclear facilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ongoing investigations by the AARO will continue to explore the nature of these sightings, with updates expected as the inquiries progress. The outcomes may influence future policies regarding airspace security and the acknowledgment of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
