      <h2>'Dish-shaped' UFO spotted 'gliding' across sky by factory workers in 'speechless' moment</h2>

<p>The sighting has garnered attention on social media, with some users claiming it is evidence of extraterrestrial life. Authorities have not confirmed the sighting and have not released any information regarding potential investigations into the incident.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 4 at 12:13 p.m., Alex Ramage and Andrei Volk were on a work break when they began filming an airplane. While testing the zoom on their phone camera, they inadvertently captured footage of a UFO.</p>
<p>Upon reviewing the video, the workers expressed disbelief at what they saw. They described the object as oval and 'gliding' across the sky, prompting them to share their experience on social media.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "We thought it was pretty wild and we were freaking out about it," said Alex Ramage. "It looked way different than the movement of a plane. It was gliding so I don't think it was anything like that."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "We were in shock and awe because I've always believed in UFOs but to experience it for myself is amazing," Ramage added. "It was a speechless moment because we were just randomly filming something. What are the odds?"
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting follows recent studies suggesting that evidence of UFOs may have been captured in historical photographs taken from the 1950s. Scientists have examined images from before the Space Age and found mysterious flashes of light that may indicate the presence of unidentified objects, potentially predating the launch of Sputnik.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, there are no official investigations into the sighting, and authorities have not released further information. The workers continue to share their video, while social media remains divided on its significance.</p>
