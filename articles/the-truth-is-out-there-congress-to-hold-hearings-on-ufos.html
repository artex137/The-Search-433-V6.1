      <h2>The truth is out there: Congress to hold hearings on UFOs</h2>

<p>A House task force will hold a hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) on Tuesday at 10 a.m. in Washington, D.C., Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna announced. The hearing aims to address government transparency regarding UAP sightings and their potential threats to public safety. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the UAPs.</p>

<p>The hearing is significant as it seeks to push for “maximum transparency” from the federal government, according to Luna, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets. She stated that the American public deserves clear information about UAP sightings and government actions related to them.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. on Tuesday in Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Witnesses include Air Force veterans Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Dyland Borland, Navy veteran Alexandro Wiggins, and journalist George Knapp.</li>
    <li>The hearing will focus on disclosures from the Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.</li>
    <li>Last fall, a separate House Oversight subcommittee held a hearing on UAPs.</li>
    <li>Retired Major David Grusch alleged the U.S. government had reverse engineered non-human technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been increased attention on UAPs. In 2023, three military veterans testified before a House Oversight subcommittee, discussing the need for a stigma-free reporting system for military and commercial pilots. Grusch, a former member of the Pentagon's UAP Task Force, made allegations regarding government possession of non-human biological matter.</p>

<p>In 2004, U.S. Navy Commander David Fravor witnessed an unidentified object off the coast of Southern California, leading to the release of the now-famous “Tic Tac” video. This incident raised questions about UAPs and their implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans’ safety,” said Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Whistleblowers who provide details on spending information and policies and procedures regarding the classification and declassification of UAPs should be able to do so without retribution,” she added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The U.S. government has faced criticism for withholding information about documented UFO cases for decades. Recent hearings have highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in reporting UAP sightings. Public interest in UAPs has surged, particularly following the release of military footage and testimonies from credible witnesses.</p>

<p>In February 2023, Air Force jets shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon, raising concerns about national security and the implications of unidentified aerial objects in U.S. airspace.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The House task force will continue to investigate UAPs and seek further disclosures from the Pentagon. The upcoming hearing is expected to provide new insights into the government's knowledge of UAPs and the implications for public safety.</p>
