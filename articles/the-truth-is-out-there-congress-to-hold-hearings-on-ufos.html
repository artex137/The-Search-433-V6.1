      <h2>The truth is out there: Congress to hold hearings on UFOs</h2>

<p>A House task force on government transparency will hold a hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as UFOs, at 10 a.m. on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. The hearing aims to address government transparency regarding UAP sightings and their potential threat to public safety. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with UAPs.</p>

<p>The task force, chaired by Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, seeks "maximum transparency" from the government. Luna stated that the American people deserve to know about UAP sightings, acquisitions, and examinations. She highlighted the importance of protecting whistleblowers who provide information on UAP-related spending and policies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday in Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Witnesses include Air Force veterans Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Dyland Borland, and Navy veteran Alexandro Wiggins.</li>
    <li>Also scheduled to testify is journalist George Knapp.</li>
    <li>The hearing will focus on disclosures from the Pentagon and the Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.</li>
    <li>Last fall, a separate hearing revealed government withholding of information about UAP cases spanning decades.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been increasing pressure from whistleblowers and Congressional leaders for the government to disclose information about UAPs. In 2023, three military veterans testified before a House Oversight subcommittee, emphasizing the need for a reporting mechanism for military and commercial pilots to report UAP sightings without stigma. Retired Major David Grusch, a whistleblower, claimed the government had reverse-engineered non-human technology from crash sites.</p>

<p>A notable incident occurred in 2004 when U.S. Navy Commander David Fravor witnessed a white oval object, later known as the "Tic Tac" video, off the coast of Southern California. The object reportedly matched the Navy fighter's trajectory before disappearing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans’ safety,” said Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior incidents of UAP sightings have generated public interest and concern. In 2022, a series of strange UAP sightings in New Jersey left residents and local officials puzzled. State Senator Jon Bramnick called for a "limited state of emergency" during those events. As unmanned aerial vehicles, including drones, become more common, the potential risks to national security are becoming a significant concern.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The House task force will conduct its hearing on UAPs next week, focusing on government disclosures and the ongoing investigation by the Department of Defense. Further details from the hearing will be made available after the session concludes.</p>
