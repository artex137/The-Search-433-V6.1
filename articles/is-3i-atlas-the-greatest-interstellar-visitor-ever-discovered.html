      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS the Greatest Interstellar Visitor Ever Discovered?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar comet identified, was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Río Hurtado, Chile, approximately 670 million km from the Sun. The comet is currently travelling at a speed of 221,000 km/h and is expected to be visible to the naked eye by October 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery has garnered significant attention in the astronomical community and among the public. Authorities and scientists are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and physical characteristics using various space telescopes and observatories. The comet's trajectory is set to take it past Mars and other planets in our solar system, although there is no risk of collision, according to the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of Discovery: Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Speed: 221,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Distance from Sun at Discovery: 670 million km</li>
    <li>Size: Nucleus estimated between 440 m and 5.6 km</li>
    <li>Expected Visibility: Naked-eye visibility by October 2025</li>
    <li>Monitoring Agencies: NASA (Hubble, Webb, TESS, Swift, etc.), ESA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2025, pre-discovery images revealed the path of 3I/ATLAS, confirming its hyperbolic trajectory, which indicates an interstellar origin. The comet was officially named 3I/ATLAS after its discovery, signifying its place as the third known interstellar object.</p>

<p>As of October 3, 2025, the comet is expected to pass within 1.67 million miles of Mars. It will reach its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 30, 2025. During this time, observations will be intensified as it approaches the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no risk of collision with Earth or any other planet, and we are excited to study this unique object,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a rare group of interstellar visitors, with only two others, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, having been identified before it. Its discovery has sparked discussions about the origins of such comets and their potential implications for understanding the cosmos.</p>

<p>Historical comets like Halley's Comet and Hale-Bopp have left significant cultural and scientific legacies, raising questions about how 3I/ATLAS will be remembered in the future.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, astronomers will conduct ongoing observations and analyses to gather more data on its composition and trajectory. The scientific community anticipates further insights into its origins and characteristics as it becomes more visible in the coming months.</p>
