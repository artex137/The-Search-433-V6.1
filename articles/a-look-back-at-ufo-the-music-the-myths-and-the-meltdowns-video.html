      <h2>A Look Back At UFO – “The Music, The Myths, And The Meltdowns” (Video)</h2>

<p>A new mini-documentary titled “The Music, The Myths, And The Meltdowns” has been released by Guitar Meets Science, exploring the turbulent career of the British rock band UFO. The documentary details the band's evolution from their space-rock beginnings to their status as hard rock icons, particularly highlighting the contributions of guitarist Michael Schenker. The release of the documentary coincides with the reissue of UFO’s classic 1980 album, <strong>No Place To Run</strong>, which is now available in various formats.</p>

<p>This documentary matters as it not only chronicles the band’s influential music but also addresses the internal challenges that shaped their journey. Authorities from Chrysalis Records have facilitated the remastering and reissue of <strong>No Place To Run</strong>, aiming to reach both long-time fans and new listeners.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The thing that sticks in my mind from recording <strong>No Place To Run</strong> was the complete mismatch with UFO / George Martin (who was a lovely chap) and nothing summed it up more than when George would say to Geoff (sound engineer): ‘Well Geoff, it’s six o’clock, time for a G&T out on the veranda.’ How very civilized!”</blockquote>
<p>— Phil Mogg</p>

<blockquote>“Paul Chapman’s guitar sound here is really superb, a thick and singing B.C.Rich-into-Marshall tone… <strong>No Place To Run</strong> is certainly a special time for the band, the peak of their public acceptance.”</blockquote>
<p>— Brian Kehew</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO has had a significant influence on the rock genre, impacting bands like Iron Maiden and Metallica. Despite their contributions, internal conflicts and lineup changes have often hindered their progress. The band's ability to adapt and persist through these challenges has been a defining characteristic of their history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The reissue of <strong>No Place To Run</strong> will be available in double CD and 3LP formats, featuring new liner notes and interviews with key band members. Fans can look forward to the additional content from the live show at the Marquee, which captures a critical moment in UFO's legacy.</p>
