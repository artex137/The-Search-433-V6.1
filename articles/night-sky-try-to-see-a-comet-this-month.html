      <h2>Night sky: Try to see a comet this month</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) is set to brighten enough to be visible with the naked eye as it transitions from a morning object to an evening one, with its closest approach to Earth occurring on October 21 at a distance of 56 million miles. The comet's visibility is expected to attract significant public interest, and it is anticipated that clearer images will emerge in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The discovery of Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) in January has sparked excitement among skywatchers. Authorities, including NASA, have been monitoring the comet's trajectory. However, the ongoing US government shutdown has hindered NASA's ability to confirm sightings of the comet captured by its Perseverance Mars rover.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) will make its closest approach to Earth on October 21, 2025.</li>
  <li>Distance at closest approach: 56 million miles.</li>
  <li>The comet was discovered in January 2025.</li>
  <li>NASA's Perseverance rover has potentially captured images of Comet 3I/Atlas.</li>
  <li>Comet 3I/Atlas passed Mars at a distance of 18 million miles earlier in October.</li>
  <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will pass the Sun at a distance of 130 million miles.</li>
  <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will have its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) was discovered in January 2025. It is expected to become visible with the naked eye as it shifts to the evening sky. The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on October 21, 2025, at a distance of 56 million miles. Meanwhile, Comet 3I/Atlas passed Mars at 18 million miles in early October and will approach the Sun at 130 million miles before its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is a high probability that the image captured by the Perseverance rover is indeed Comet 3I/Atlas,” said a NASA spokesperson. “However, due to the ongoing government shutdown, we cannot confirm this sighting.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Chris Lintott, BBC Sky at Night presenter, described speculation about the comet being artificial as “Nonsense on stilts.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) is one of several comets expected to be visible this year, with past encounters highlighting their unpredictable nature. The ongoing US government shutdown has limited NASA's ability to provide updates and confirm observations of celestial events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to observe the comet as it becomes visible in the coming weeks. NASA's ability to confirm sightings of Comet 3I/Atlas remains uncertain until the government shutdown is resolved.</p>
