      <h2>Chinese Tianwen-1 mission reveals details of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in historic images</h2>

<p>The Chinese probe Tianwen-1 has captured high-resolution images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from the orbit of Mars, marking a significant achievement in planetary science. The images were taken in October 2025, approximately 30 million kilometers from the comet, and represent the first time an object of interstellar origin has been imaged from another planet's orbit. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This mission is crucial as it provides valuable data for the scientific community to study the composition and trajectory of interstellar objects entering our Solar System. The successful operation demonstrates the advanced capabilities of the China National Space Administration (CNSA), as various space agencies collaborated to gather information during the comet's passage near Mars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Comet:</strong> Approximately 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Diameter:</strong> Estimated at 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Mission Launch:</strong> July 2020</li>
    <li><strong>Orbiter Entry:</strong> February 2021</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Planning Start:</strong> September 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Tianwen-1 mission launched in July 2020 and successfully entered Mars' orbit in February 2021. The mission includes an orbiter, a lander, and the Zhurong rover. The team began planning the observation of comet 3I/ATLAS in September 2025, based on accurate orbital predictions. The images were captured in October 2025, demonstrating the advanced technical capabilities of China's space program.</p>

<p>The images reveal the rocky and frozen core of 3I/ATLAS, surrounded by a coma and a tail extending approximately 56,000 kilometers. Preliminary spectral analyses indicate the presence of water ice and carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The successful observation of 3I/ATLAS serves as an important validation of the technologies and methods that will be used in future deep space exploration missions by China,” said a spokesperson from the China National Space Administration.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third object of confirmed interstellar origin detected, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The mission highlights the collaborative efforts among various space agencies, including the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, in analyzing the comet's emissions and gathering complementary data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The CNSA plans to leverage the experience gained from this mission to enhance its Solar System exploration program, focusing on smaller bodies like asteroids and comets over the next decade.</p>
