      <h2>UFO Footage: Anna Paulina Luna Asks Why Data Is Hiding Under Black Congressional Budget</h2>

<p>US Representative Anna Paulina Luna has intensified her call for transparency regarding UFO and UAP programmes, alleging that important footage and data are concealed under a classified 'black congressional budget.' Luna, who chairs the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, made her comments during interviews on The Joe Rogan Experience, FOX 13 Tampa Bay, and the Hindustan Times.</p>

<p>This matter raises concerns over how the US government manages sensitive UAP material and whether lawmakers have adequate oversight. Luna argues that both lawmakers and taxpayers are being excluded from programs that may involve advanced aircraft and unexplained phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Representative Anna Paulina Luna is the chair of the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.</li>
    <li>Luna has claimed to have viewed classified photographs in a secure federal facility.</li>
    <li>She has described unidentified craft as 'not made by mankind.'</li>
    <li>Luna alleges that operators of these craft are referred to as 'interdimensional beings.'</li>
    <li>She has called for more congressional hearings and public accountability regarding UAP programmes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During her interviews, Luna has recounted her experiences and interactions concerning UAPs. She stated that several whistle-blowers and military personnel have described encounters with unidentified craft that defy conventional physics.</p>
<p>Luna reported a confrontation at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, where she and a congressional delegation were denied access to pilots and evidence. The base commander cited insufficient security authorization as the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>In her discussions, Luna has emphasized the need for congressional oversight and has expressed frustration with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies, claiming a 'protective complex' exists to keep these phenomena secret.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Why can't we see some of these classified videos and information that seem to be operating under a black Congressional budget? ... Congress is not being given access to money that we're spending.”</blockquote>
<p>— Anna Paulina Luna, in an interview with FOX 13 Tampa Bay.</p>
<blockquote>“I have never seen a portal open or a full alien spaceship, but I have seen photographic evidence in a secure, compartmented information facility, where I was briefed.”</blockquote>
<p>— Anna Paulina Luna, during an interview on The Joe Rogan Experience.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Luna's push for declassification reflects broader concerns about the government's handling of UFO and UAP information. Previous incidents have raised questions about the extent of congressional oversight and the transparency of funding for these programs.</p>
<p>Her inquiries tap into a long-standing debate over national security versus public accountability, as many citizens demand to know how taxpayer money is being utilized in highly secretive defense projects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Luna aims to increase congressional hearings on UAPs and ensure taxpayers are informed about how funds are allocated in these classified programs. The ongoing debate may lead to greater scrutiny of military and intelligence agencies regarding their handling of UAP data.</p>
