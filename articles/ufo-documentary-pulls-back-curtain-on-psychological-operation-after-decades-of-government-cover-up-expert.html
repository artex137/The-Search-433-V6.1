      <h2>UFO documentary pulls back curtain on ‘psychological operation’ after decades of government cover-up: expert</h2>

<p>A new documentary titled “The Age of Disclosure” has highlighted a decades-long secrecy surrounding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States. The film, directed by Dan Farah, features interviews with 34 senior members of the U.S. government and explores claims of a global cover-up regarding non-human intelligence. It premiered in select theaters in New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, and is also available on Amazon Prime Video.</p>

<p>The documentary arrives at a time when public discourse about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) has intensified, with senior government officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, beginning to discuss previously classified information. Farah stated that the film aims to inform the public and hold the government accountable regarding its knowledge of UFOs and related technologies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Documentary title: “The Age of Disclosure”</li>
  <li>Director: Dan Farah</li>
  <li>Number of interviews: 34 senior members of U.S. government</li>
  <li>Notable interviewee: Secretary of State Marco Rubio</li>
  <li>Duration of filming: Three years</li>
  <li>Current availability: Select theaters and Amazon Prime Video</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Over the past three years, Dan Farah has filmed interviews with senior U.S. government officials regarding UFOs and UAPs. The documentary reveals claims of an 80-year global cover-up and discusses the implications of these findings. The film has sparked renewed interest and discussion in Congress about the existence of non-human intelligence and the government’s handling of related information.</p>

<p>In recent years, whistleblowers have come forward, prompting senior members of Congress and the administration to seek the truth about UFOs. This has led to discussions in Congress about the classification of UAP-related information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For a very long time, the public, Congress and even the president have been kept out of the loop on this subject,” said director Dan Farah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We’ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities, and it’s not ours,” said Secretary Marco Rubio.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What really stood out to me about ‘Age of Disclosure’ is the large number of military and intelligence officials who are going on the record saying that not only do aliens or UFOs exist, but that we have a very active program of retrieving this technology,” said Kent Heckenlively, author of “Catastrophic Disclosure.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UFOs has historically been shrouded in secrecy, often dismissed by officials and the public alike. Recent discussions in Congress and the emergence of whistleblower testimonies have changed the narrative, prompting a more open dialogue about UAPs and their implications for national security.</p>

<p>As the government faces pressure to disclose more information, the documentary seeks to shed light on the potential existence of extraterrestrial technologies and the implications of maintaining such secrets for decades.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the release of “The Age of Disclosure,” it remains to be seen how Congress will respond to the information presented in the documentary. Investigations into UAPs are expected to continue, with a push for greater transparency from government officials.</p>
