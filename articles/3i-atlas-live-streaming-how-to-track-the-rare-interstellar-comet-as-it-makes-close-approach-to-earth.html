      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Streaming: How To Track The Rare Interstellar Comet As It Makes Close Approach To Earth?</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been making headlines as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach occurring on December 19, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), this comet is the third interstellar object to enter the solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. It has sparked interest among astronomers and stargazers alike.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unusual characteristics and the potential for scientific discovery. According to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, the comet displays 15 anomalies that may indicate a technological origin. As it approaches Earth at a distance of 1.79 AU (approximately 270 million miles), observatories worldwide are preparing to gather valuable data. Stargazers are encouraged to observe the comet, although its luminosity of 15.2 magnitudes may require telescopes with a minimum aperture of 30 mm for a better view.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2025, at 1.79 AU (270 million miles).</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has identified 15 anomalies that may suggest a technological origin.</li>
    <li>Comet's luminosity is currently at 15.2 magnitudes.</li>
    <li>A telescope with at least a 30 mm aperture is recommended for viewing.</li>
    <li>Observers should look towards the constellation Leo, near the star Regulus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS. Since then, astronomers have been tracking its trajectory and characteristics. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, providing an opportunity for significant observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, "There are 15 anomalies in the exocomet that indicate it may (or may not) have a technological origin."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object to visit the solar system. The previous objects, 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also intrigued scientists, leading to discussions about their origins and implications for the understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and gather data. Observations are expected to enhance understanding of the comet and its characteristics during its flyby.</p>
