      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Might Be Older Than the Sun, Scientists Claim</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered that Comet 3I/ATLAS, detected by NASA in July 2025, may be one of the oldest objects ever observed, potentially exceeding the age of the Sun. This finding marks only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</p>

<p>The implications of this discovery are significant for understanding the history of our galaxy. Scientists believe that studying Comet 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into the formation of early star systems and the prevalence of water and organic materials throughout the galaxy. Observations of the comet are urgent, as it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun and will not return.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered by NASA in July 2025</li>
    <li>Travelling at nearly 58 kilometres per second</li>
    <li>Possibly 7 to 14 billion years old</li>
    <li>Only the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system</li>
    <li>Rich in water ice and volatile materials</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, NASA detected a fast-moving object that was later identified as Comet 3I/ATLAS. Initial observations indicated that it was behaving unusually compared to typical comets. Further analysis revealed its interstellar origin and suggested that it could be older than the Sun.</p>
<p>As researchers continued to study its trajectory and composition, they concluded that the comet likely formed in the Milky Way's thick disk, a region associated with ancient stars. This comet is now passing through our solar system, providing a rare opportunity for scientific study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS is more than a cosmic curiosity; it is a messenger from deep time,” a lead researcher said. “Its existence suggests that countless ancient objects may be drifting between the stars, carrying clues about the universe’s earliest chapters.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar objects. The previous discoveries have reshaped our understanding of how these objects interact with our solar system. The study of such comets is crucial for learning about the materials that existed in the early universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes through our solar system, gathering data that could reveal more about its origins and the conditions of the early galaxy. Further findings may be published as research progresses.</p>
