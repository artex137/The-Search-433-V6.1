      <h2>What is 3I/ATLAS? HiRISE camera aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can be used to reveal its true nature</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is approaching the inner solar system and is expected to make its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2023, at a distance of 29 million kilometres. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has proposed a method to determine whether 3I/ATLAS is a comet or an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which has shown unusual signs. Most experts believe it is a comet, but Loeb claims it could be an alien spaceship. He urges world leaders to prepare for potential implications, including an alien attack. The HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter may have the opportunity to observe 3I/ATLAS closely during its approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be 29 million kilometres from Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>It could come as close as 2.7 million kilometres during its orbit.</li>
    <li>Loeb suggests a precursor probe may be ahead of 3I/ATLAS, potentially invisible from Earth.</li>
    <li>An orbit correction of 10–15 kilometres per second in September could reduce the closest approach distance to zero.</li>
    <li>NASA's TESS detected 3I/ATLAS in May 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS's brightness increased five times within weeks, a rare occurrence for comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2023, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) detected 3I/ATLAS, two months before it was observed by Atlas. Over the following weeks, the brightness of 3I/ATLAS increased significantly, stirring interest among scientists.</p>
<p>On October 3, 2023, 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Mars, allowing for potential observation by the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, "If the HiRISE camera catches 3I/ATLAS delivering materials to Mars in October 2025, then the chances of the outer space visitor being a piece of alien technology will increase manifold."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior discussions in the scientific community have focused on 3I/ATLAS's unusual characteristics, including its trajectory and brightness changes. These factors have led to debates about its classification as a comet or a potentially artificial object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, scientists will prepare to utilize the HiRISE camera to gather more data. Further observations may clarify the nature of the object and whether it poses any risk or holds significance for future exploration.</p>
