      <h2>Concerns grow over 3I/ATLAS: NASA activates planetary defense protocol to thoroughly analyze this enigmatic stellar object</h2>

<p>NASA has announced a planetary defense campaign to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS, following the detection of its unusual behavior. The announcement was made on October 21, 2025, at 21:08, and marks the first time the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) will track a comet from outside the solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this event.</p>

<p>The monitoring campaign will run from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, as authorities seek to understand the comet's inexplicable movements. The campaign aims to analyze the comet’s trajectory and any potential implications it may have for Earth. NASA has activated its planetary defense systems in response to concerns raised by the comet's behavior, which includes a trail of particles directed towards the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event</strong>: Announcement of IAWN Comet Astrometry Campaign</li>
    <li><strong>Date</strong>: October 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Time</strong>: 21:08</li>
    <li><strong>Comet</strong>: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring period</strong>: November 27, 2025 - January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Agency</strong>: NASA, International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 21, 2025, NASA issued an electronic circular announcing the IAWN Comet Astrometry Campaign focused on comet 3I/ATLAS. This was prompted by the detection of strange behavior, including a particle trail that defies typical comet behavior.</p>
<p>The monitoring campaign is set to last for two months, during which telescopes worldwide will observe the comet's path closely. The unusual movements have sparked speculation among the public and experts alike.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Announcement of the IAWN Comet Astrometry Campaign from November 27, 2025 to January 27, 2026. The campaign will focus on comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1),”</blockquote>
<p>— NASA electronic circular, October 21, 2025</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This announcement comes as part of NASA's ongoing efforts to monitor celestial objects that may pose a threat to Earth. The IAWN is typically activated for real threats, underscoring the seriousness of the situation surrounding 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>Previous comets have been monitored closely, but 3I/ATLAS is unique due to its external origin and unusual behavior, leading to speculation about its nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and IAWN will continue to track 3I/ATLAS over the next two months to gather data on its trajectory and behavior. Further analysis will determine if any additional actions are required in relation to the comet.</p>
