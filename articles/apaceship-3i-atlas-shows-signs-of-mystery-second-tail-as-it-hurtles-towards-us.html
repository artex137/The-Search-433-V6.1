      <h2>'Apaceship' 3I/ATLAS shows signs of mystery second tail as it hurtles towards us</h2>

<p>An unidentified object, dubbed 3I/ATLAS, is exhibiting signs of a second tail as it travels through space at a speed of 130,000 mph. New images taken by the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer on November 2 have caused excitement among scientists and researchers. The images suggest that the comet has a glowing halo of gas and dust surrounding it, creating what appears to be two tails.</p>

<p>This discovery has prompted discussions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, with theoretical physicist Avi Loeb suggesting it could be an alien "mothership." The data collected by the Juice satellite will be transmitted to Earth in February, which will help provide further insights into the comet's composition and trajectory as it approaches Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 130,000 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Data transmission dates:</strong> February 18 and 20, 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Satellite:</strong> European Space Agency's Juice</li>
    <li><strong>Image capture date:</strong> November 2, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 2, 2023, images of 3I/ATLAS were captured by the European Space Agency's Juice satellite, showing a second tail of the comet. This was two days before the object came closest to the satellite. The comet is expected to reach its closest distance to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<p>Data regarding the composition and shape of the comet's gas and dust plume will be transmitted back to Earth in February 2024. The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Jupiter is scheduled for March 16, 2026, while the Juice satellite will arrive at Jupiter in July 2031.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The image displays a glowing halo of gas and dust (coma) surrounding 3I/ATLAS with a hint of two tails," said Avi Loeb in his latest blog post.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "We all wait eagerly for the expected arrival of this data, a month before the closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Jupiter on March 16, 2026," Loeb noted regarding the upcoming data transmission.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, NASA scientists had classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet. Avi Loeb has suggested that the object's jets may be "pulsing like a heartbeat," indicating a complex structure. The object has generated significant interest due to its potential to reveal insights about interstellar objects and extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As data from the Juice satellite is scheduled for transmission in February 2024, scientists anticipate further analysis of 3I/ATLAS. The findings will provide more information about the comet's trajectory and characteristics leading up to its closest approach to Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
