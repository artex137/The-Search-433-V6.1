      <h2>Leaked Pentagon footage shows UFO making 'impossible' moves before going to warp speed</h2>

<p>Shocking video footage of a UFO escaping from a US military drone at extraordinary speed has emerged from the Pentagon. The video, revealed by investigative journalist Jeremy Corbell on February 6, 2026, allegedly shows a mushroom-shaped craft flying over Syria's Suwayda province in 2021. The craft appears to hover before accelerating to near-light speed and disappearing from view.</p>

<p>This footage has raised concerns and interest among authorities regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). Corbell and his co-host George Knapp claim the video is the latest evidence of non-human craft, leaked from the Department of War's archives. The Pentagon has officially stated that it has never collected physical proof that confirms the existence of UFOs or extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video revealed on February 6, 2026.</li>
    <li>Footage captured by an MQ-9 Reaper drone in 2021.</li>
    <li>Location: Suwayda province, Syria.</li>
    <li>Video shows a mushroom-shaped craft accelerating to near-light speed.</li>
    <li>Investigators include Jeremy Corbell, George Knapp, and Marik von Rennenkampff.</li>
    <li>Claims of instantaneous acceleration and hypersonic velocities without signatures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2021, an MQ-9 Reaper drone, operated by the US Air Force, recorded footage of a UFO over Syria. The video was later obtained from a source within the intelligence community. On February 6, 2026, Jeremy Corbell revealed the footage during an episode of the WEAPONIZED Podcast. The footage has since sparked discussions on UAP and their implications for national security.</p>

<p>During the podcast, Corbell and Knapp analyzed the footage, which showed the UFO maneuvering to break the drone's lock before accelerating rapidly. They emphasized the authenticity of the video, noting its origin from military archives.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It breaks our ideas of physics that something can do that,” said Jeremy Corbell during the podcast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That most certainly does not look like any kind of conventional aircraft,” stated Marik von Rennenkampff, referring to the object in the video.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent video adds to a growing body of evidence regarding UAP. Military personnel have previously reported encounters with objects displaying similar behaviors, such as instantaneous acceleration and hypersonic travel without typical signatures. The Pentagon has faced scrutiny over its handling of UAP reports and the lack of transparency regarding investigations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the footage and the broader implications of UAP are expected to continue. Authorities may review the footage to assess its authenticity and implications for national security. Further analysis by experts in the field is anticipated.</p>
