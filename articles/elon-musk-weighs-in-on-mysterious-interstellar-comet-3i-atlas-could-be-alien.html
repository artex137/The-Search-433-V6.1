      <h2>Elon Musk weighs in on mysterious interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: ‘could be alien’</h2>

<p>SpaceX CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong> has commented on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently visiting our solar system. The comet was expected to reach its closest approach to the Sun on <strong>last Thursday</strong>. Musk discussed the comet's unusual behaviour during an appearance on <strong>The Joe Rogan Experience</strong> podcast, suggesting it might be influenced by forces beyond gravity.</p>

<p>This discussion has sparked interest among astronomers and space enthusiasts. Authorities, including NASA, have stated that the comet does not pose a threat to Earth, but they have activated planetary defense mechanisms as a precaution.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> Last Thursday</li>
    <li><strong>Influence:</strong> Possible alien spacecraft, according to Musk</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Entirely nickel</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Manhattan-sized</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's Assurance:</strong> No danger to Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed as it approaches the Sun, with its closest approach occurring last Thursday. Musk's remarks were made during a podcast episode that has drawn significant attention to the comet's characteristics and potential origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It is possible that 3I/ATLAS could be an ‘alien’ spacecraft because it appeared to be influenced by forces beyond gravity,” Musk said during the podcast.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Probably kill most of the human life,” Musk added, referencing the potential impact of the comet on Earth.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is noted as humanity's third recorded interstellar visitor. The comet's behaviour, including a reverse thrust and its disappearance beyond the Sun, has raised questions about its nature and origin. NASA has previously assured the public that similar celestial bodies do not pose threats, but the agency has activated defense protocols as a precautionary measure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. The agency’s planetary defense mechanisms remain active, ensuring readiness for any unforeseen developments.</p>
