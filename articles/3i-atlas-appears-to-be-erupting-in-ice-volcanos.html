      <h2>3I/ATLAS Appears to Be Erupting in Ice Volcanos</h2>

<p>Mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of erupting ice volcanoes as it reaches its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, earlier this year. Astronomers have observed the object shedding significant amounts of ice and dust, creating enormous jets and an unusual “anti-tail” that faces the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it may provide insights into the characteristics of trans-Neptunian objects, which are icy bodies found beyond Neptune's orbit. Researchers aim to understand the processes behind 3I/ATLAS’s activity, with the expectation that it will reach its closest point to Earth later this month.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached: Late October 2023</li>
    <li>Observation site: Joan Oró Telescope, Montsec Observatory, Spain</li>
    <li>Estimated size: Between 426 meters (1,400 feet) and 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) across</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Earth: Later this month</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Jupiter: March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion in late October 2023. During this time, astronomers utilized the Joan Oró Telescope in Spain to observe the object closely. They documented jets of gas and dust particles being expelled, indicating signs of cryovolcanism.</p>

<p>Josep Trigo-Rodríguez, lead author of a study on the object, noted that the findings challenge current models of planetary-system formation. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We were all surprised,” said Josep Trigo-Rodríguez, staff researcher at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain. “Being a comet formed in a remote planetary system, it is remarkable that the mixture of materials forming the surface of the body has resemblance with trans-Neptunian objects.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Interstellar visitors like 3I/ATLAS continue to challenge and refine our understanding of planetary-system formation and the chemical evolution of small bodies,” concluded Trigo-Rodríguez and his colleagues.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the few interstellar objects observed traveling through the solar system. Its activity contributes to the understanding of the chemical evolution of small celestial bodies. Previous studies of similar objects have indicated that they may also exhibit cryovolcanism.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue studying 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with hopes of gathering more data on its composition and activity. Future intercept missions may be essential for directly sampling the object and unlocking the record it carries from distant planetary systems.</p>
