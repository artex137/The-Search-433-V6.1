      <h2>Russia's Chilling UFO Files: Nukes Aimed at New York Nearly Fired As Aliens Vanished</h2>

<p>In October 1982, Russian officers reported that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) gained control of nuclear missiles aimed at New York before disappearing, potentially averting a catastrophe. The incident, described in secret Soviet documents, occurred above a missile base near Usovo, Ukraine, and reportedly involved missiles fully primed for launch.</p>

<p>This revelation highlights the dangers of nuclear weapons and the unexplained phenomena surrounding them. Authorities have not disclosed any ongoing investigations, but the incident has raised concerns about the security of nuclear arsenals during the Cold War.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in October 1982.</li>
    <li>Location: Missile base near Usovo, Ukraine.</li>
    <li>Missiles were reportedly on full alert and ready to fire.</li>
    <li>Witnesses included high-ranking officers from the Soviet Ministry of Defence.</li>
    <li>The launch process stopped when the UFOs vanished from sight.</li>
    <li>Similar incident reported at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, USA, in 1967.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The events unfolded as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>October 1982: Multiple glowing objects appeared in the sky above the Usovo missile base.</li>
    <li>The launch console activated without human input, indicating a malfunction.</li>
    <li>Missiles were primed for launch, reportedly ready to strike New York.</li>
    <li>As the UFOs vanished, the launch process abruptly ceased, averting a potential nuclear disaster.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The launch console suddenly lit up without any human input, as though an invisible hand had entered the correct firing codes," said a senior communications officer from the control bunker.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Usovo incident is not an isolated case. A similar event occurred in 1967 at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, where retired U.S. personnel reported UFOs hovering near nuclear silos, which subsequently malfunctioned. These parallels have prompted discussions in the U.S. Congress regarding unidentified aerial phenomena and nuclear security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not indicated any future investigations or actions related to the Usovo incident. The lack of physical evidence, such as wreckage or radar recordings, leaves many questions unanswered about the true nature of these encounters.</p>
