      <h2>Police chopper's encounter with unidentified drones raises concerns</h2>

<p>A police helicopter experienced a close encounter with unidentified high-speed drones over RAF Lakenheath, a US military base in England, on November 22, 2024. No injuries or fatalities have been reported. The incident has gained renewed attention following the release of video footage and police logs that contradict earlier assessments by authorities.</p>

<p>This incident matters as it highlights ongoing concerns regarding airspace security around military installations. Authorities, including the UK Ministry of Defence Police, are currently investigating the reports of drone activity that have been linked to multiple sightings over US air bases in England.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident Date: November 22, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, England</li>
    <li>Aircraft: National Police Air Service (NPAS) EC135 helicopter</li>
    <li>Reported Speed of Drones: Approximately 140 knots (161 km/h)</li>
    <li>Witness Description: Drones described as 'tic-tac' shaped</li>
    <li>Number of Drones: Estimated 10-15 across multiple bases</li>
    <li>Investigation Status: Ongoing by the UK Ministry of Defence Police</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 20-22, 2024, Suffolk Police logs documented numerous sightings of drones over RAF Feltwell, RAF Lakenheath, and RAF Mildenhall, with reports indicating approximately 20 drones flying between 18:00 and 00:00 hours. On November 22, the NPAS helicopter reported a near miss with unidentified objects, describing them as pursuing the aircraft at high speeds.</p>

<p>A UK military source, who reviewed video footage from the incident, stated that the NPAS pilots did not mention F-15 fighter jets, only the drones that were mirroring their movements. The footage reportedly shows one drone performing maneuvers not possible for a fixed-wing aircraft.</p>

<p>On November 21, police logs indicated that officers had observed 5-6 drones near the A1065 highway close to the airfield. Witnesses described the drones as large, well-lit, and making considerable noise.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They were forced to take emergency evasive action in relation to a drone which came within a dangerously close proximity to them,” said an incident log from Suffolk Police.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the 30-minute video with pilot audio, nobody mentions F-15s,” said a military source. “They only talk about the drones. How they're basically mirroring the helicopter's movements.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There is a whole series of question marks about what went on in November 2024,” said Mike Morgan, a retired senior police detective. “What is so secret about this investigation?”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a series of reports regarding drone activity near military installations in the UK, raising concerns about airspace breaches. The UK Airprox Board previously concluded that the NPAS crew had misidentified the lights of a US Air Force F-15 Eagle jet as drones, leading to skepticism about the accuracy of the investigation.</p>

<p>In recent months, there have been increasing reports of unidentified aerial phenomena, prompting calls for greater transparency from authorities in handling such incidents.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The investigation by the UK Ministry of Defence Police is ongoing, with no published findings available at this time. Authorities are expected to continue examining the drone sightings and the implications for airspace security around military bases.</p>
