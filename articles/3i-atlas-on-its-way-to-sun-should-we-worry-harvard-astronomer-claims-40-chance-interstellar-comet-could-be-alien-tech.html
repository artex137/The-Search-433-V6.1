      <h2>3I/Atlas on its way to Sun: Should we worry? Harvard astronomer claims 40% chance interstellar comet could be alien tech</h2>

<p>3I/Atlas, an interstellar comet, is currently on a hyperbolic path towards the Sun. The comet, which originated outside our solar system, has sparked both scientific interest and sensational headlines due to its unique trajectory. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to its approach.</p>

<p>This matter has attracted attention primarily due to a claim made by Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, who stated there is a 40% chance that interstellar objects like 3I/Atlas could be alien technology. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have confirmed that 3I/Atlas is not on a collision course with Earth, alleviating public concern about potential hazards.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is on a hyperbolic trajectory towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims a 40% chance it could be alien technology.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA confirm it is not on a collision course with Earth.</li>
    <li>There are no known hazards to Earth regarding this comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered as an interstellar comet, leading to significant scientific interest. Avi Loeb made his claim regarding the potential for alien technology, which has been met with skepticism from the astronomy community. NASA and the ESA subsequently confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The path it has to follow does not cross our orbit, and it will safely traverse the solar system before heading back to interstellar space,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>While claims of alien origins often attract media attention, the scientific consensus maintains that 3I/Atlas is a natural comet. Astronomers continue to study interstellar objects like this to gain insights into the universe beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations of 3I/Atlas will continue as astronomers seek to gather more data about interstellar comets and their origins.</p>
