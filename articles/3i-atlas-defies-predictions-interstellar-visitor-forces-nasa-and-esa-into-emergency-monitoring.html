      <h2>3I/ATLAS Defies Predictions: Interstellar Visitor Forces NASA and ESA Into Emergency Monitoring</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has entered the Solar System and is exhibiting unpredictable behaviour, prompting an emergency monitoring campaign by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN). This event marks only the third identification of such an object in history.</p>

<p>Authorities have stated that the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS will bring it close to NASA's Europa Clipper and ESA's Hera spacecraft between 25 October and 6 November. This rare encounter provides a unique opportunity to study the ion tail of the comet, which has not been extensively documented in previous interstellar encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass near Europa Clipper and Hera between 25 October and 6 November.</li>
    <li>The closest distance to the spacecraft is predicted to be approximately five million miles.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the first interstellar object added to the IAWN's monitoring list.</li>
    <li>A global drill will take place from 27 November 2025 to 27 January 2026.</li>
    <li>Research indicates 3I/ATLAS may not have a fully natural origin, with claims of unusual features.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object, prompting agencies to monitor its trajectory closely. As the comet approached the Solar System, it exhibited erratic behaviour, leading to heightened concerns from NASA and ESA. Between 25 October and 6 November, it will pass near the Europa Clipper and Hera spacecraft, allowing for unprecedented study of its ion tail.</p>

<p>The IAWN added 3I/ATLAS to its monitoring list, initiating a global response plan. From 27 November 2025 to 27 January 2026, scientists will conduct a worldwide drill using telescopes and tracking systems to improve detection methods for potential threats.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have virtually no data on the interior of interstellar comets and the star systems that formed them,” said Samuel Gran, a postdoctoral researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. “Sampling the tail in this way is the closest we can currently get to a direct sample of such an object, and thus a different part of the galaxy.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Encounters with interstellar comets have historically been rare and often went unnoticed. Previous objects, such as 'Oumuamua,' have raised questions about the origins and nature of such visitors. The addition of 3I/ATLAS to the IAWN's list reflects growing concerns about tracking potential threats from near-Earth objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches. The global drill scheduled for late 2025 aims to refine detection methods and enhance preparedness for any future interstellar threats.</p>
