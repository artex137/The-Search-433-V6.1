      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Exocomet Sheds Much Bigger Particles Than It Should</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, has displayed unusual characteristics during its closest flyby of Earth on December 19, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Warning System (ATLAS) observatory in Chile, the comet has raised questions among scientists, particularly Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who has identified multiple anomalies in its behaviour.</p>

<p>The significance of these findings lies in the implications for our understanding of comets and interstellar objects. Authorities and researchers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS, as its behaviour challenges existing models of cometary physics. The observations may lead to a re-evaluation of how such objects interact with solar radiation and how they are formed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Earth Flyby:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observatory:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Warning System (ATLAS), Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Anomalies:</strong> 15 identified by Avi Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Anti-tail Length:</strong> At least 400,000 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Particle Size Requirement:</strong> Between 1 micron and 100 microns</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS observatory in Chile. Since then, it has been observed closely, particularly as it approached Earth in December. On December 19, 2025, the object made its closest flyby, prompting further analysis of its unusual characteristics.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb has published his findings regarding the object’s anomalies, including the anti-tail, in various forums, raising questions about the nature of the particles being emitted by 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The tight collimation of the anti-tail jet of 3I/ATLAS might be the result of the release of large particles from a very small fraction of the surface of the nucleus."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb explained, "The radius of the particles in the outflow from 3I/ATLAS must be bigger than 1 micron in order for them to reach the observed length of the anti-tail jet and smaller than 100 microns in order for them to reach the required jet speed through drag on the outflowing gas."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third recorded interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Previous studies of these objects have generally conformed to known models of cometary behaviour, making the anomalies observed in 3I/ATLAS particularly noteworthy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it moves further into the solar system. Further observations are expected to clarify the nature of the particles being emitted and whether they align with known cometary behaviour or indicate something more exotic.</p>
