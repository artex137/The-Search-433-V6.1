      <h2>Avi Loeb Issues Dire Warning: Earth Will Burn, Humanity Needs a Space Ark</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has warned that Earth faces imminent threats due to interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, urging humanity to build a 'space ark' as a preventive measure. Loeb's remarks come amid growing public interest in the comet, which is currently traversing the solar system.</p>

<p>Loeb's claims highlight a broader conversation about existential risks, including climate change and artificial intelligence. He argues that investing in a self-sustaining space platform is crucial for humanity's survival. Authorities and scientists are now evaluating the implications of his proposals, which challenge conventional scientific discourse.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Build a 'space ark'</li>
    <li><strong>Annual Military Spending:</strong> $2.4 trillion</li>
    <li><strong>Upcoming Close Approach:</strong> December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has captured the attention of astronomers since its discovery. Loeb has linked its presence to a series of existential threats, including climate change and potential alien technology. In October 2025, he published an essay outlining his views, suggesting the object's close approach would serve as a critical test of its nature.</p>

<p>Loeb's theories have sparked debate within the scientific community, with many experts expressing skepticism about his claims regarding 3I/ATLAS's origin. Despite this, he maintains that his warnings are crucial for humanity's future.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We spend $2.4 trillion yearly on military budgets. Redirect a fraction toward a NOAA-style ark in space. Within this century, we'll create habitats better than Mars.” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's views are not new; other scientists have previously suggested the need for humanity to explore beyond Earth. However, his specific association of these ideas with 3I/ATLAS has reignited discussions about the balance between scientific evidence and speculative thought. Past claims made by Loeb have faced criticism, such as his assertion regarding an interstellar meteor impact in 2014, which was debunked by seismologists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ongoing discourse surrounding 3I/ATLAS and Loeb's theories will likely continue to evolve as more data becomes available. Scientists aim to gather evidence to clarify the object's nature, while Loeb's provocative ideas will keep fueling public interest and debate about humanity's future in the cosmos.</p>
