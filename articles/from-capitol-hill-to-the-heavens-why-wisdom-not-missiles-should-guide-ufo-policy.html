      <h2>From Capitol Hill to the Heavens: Why Wisdom, Not Missiles, Should Guide UFO Policy</h2>

<p>On September 12, 2025, veterans and lawmakers gathered on Capitol Hill for a hearing focused on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), as referred to by the Pentagon. The session included a recently released video showing a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone firing a Hellfire missile at a luminous orb off the coast of Yemen, which the missile struck but failed to neutralize.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it raises questions about military engagement with UAPs and the effectiveness of current defense strategies. Authorities, including the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), are under scrutiny for their handling of UAP encounters and the lack of transparency regarding these incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing took place on September 12, 2025, at Capitol Hill.</li>
    <li>A U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone fired a Hellfire missile at a UAP off Yemen.</li>
    <li>The missile struck the object but bounced off, leaving it unharmed.</li>
    <li>Testimony included accounts from military professionals expressing fear regarding UAPs.</li>
    <li>The AARO is led by Dr. Jon T. Kosloski, appointed in August 2024.</li>
    <li>Congress has received hundreds of reports on UAPs, but responses remain unclear.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The hearing on UAPs at Capitol Hill highlighted a pressing issue within military operations. The incident involving the MQ-9 Reaper drone occurred off the coast of Yemen, where the missile was launched but failed to neutralize the unidentified object.</p>
<p>During the session, investigative journalist George Knapp presented the video of the incident, which elicited a strong emotional response from military personnel present. Many admitted to feeling fear, a notable reaction given their training to confront danger.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “That’s a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO—and bouncing right off,” testified George Knapp, emphasizing the unusual nature of the encounter.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    A spokesperson for AARO stated, “I have nothing for you,” when pressed for further details about the incident.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing follows a growing trend in military and governmental recognition of UAPs. The AARO was established to systematically study these phenomena, but the lack of clear answers or explanations raises concerns about military readiness and policy. Previous reports have documented similar encounters, leading to increased public interest and scrutiny.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the UAP incident are expected to continue, with calls for greater transparency and a shift in military policy towards more study and less immediate confrontation. The future steps include potential congressional inquiries and further analysis from the AARO.</p>
