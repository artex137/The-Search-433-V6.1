      <h2>UFO researcher claims intimidation following Trump disclosure allegations</h2>

<p>Mark Christopher Lee, a UFO researcher, has claimed he is facing an anonymous intimidation campaign after alleging that Donald Trump is preparing a historic alien disclosure speech, scheduled for July 8, 2026, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>This matter has raised concerns about potential interference in the disclosure of information regarding extraterrestrial visitation and recovered non-human craft. Authorities have not yet responded to Lee's claims of intimidation or the alleged threats he has received.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of claim:</strong> 17 February 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Proposed speech date:</strong> 8 July 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Location of planned press conference:</strong> Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li><strong>Source of intimidation:</strong> Anonymous emails</li>
    <li><strong>Lee's recent publication:</strong> The Cosmic Joker: Why Angels, Aliens and Demons Are All the Same Intelligence</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 17 February 2026, Mark Christopher Lee alleged that Donald Trump is preparing an alien disclosure speech, which he claims is based on information from a trusted insider in Washington.</p>
<p>Lee received a series of anonymous emails warning him to refrain from discussing the planned announcement. One email suggested there were "powerful interests" trying to prevent the disclosure.</p>
<p>In response to the threats, Lee announced that his source intends to hold a press conference on 1 May 2026, to disclose further information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The intimidation only reinforces that we are touching on something profound. Attempts to silence this information will not succeed. The public deserves the truth.”</blockquote> — Mark Christopher Lee

<blockquote>“I’d suggest you tell your source to come forward sooner than later. There is a move to stop this announcement, it is much safer to flood this information out now.”</blockquote> — Excerpt from an anonymous email received by Lee

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims come amid increasing public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and government transparency regarding extraterrestrial matters. Recent remarks from individuals close to the Trump administration, including Lara Trump, have suggested that the President might soon release UFO-related information.</p>
<p>Lee's book, which explores the nature of UFO phenomena, has contributed to the ongoing discourse surrounding UAPs and their implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee plans to hold a press conference on 1 May 2026, where he expects to reveal further details about the alleged alien disclosure and the intimidation he has faced.</p>
