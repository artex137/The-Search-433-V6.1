      <h2>NASA Releases Fresh Pics of Weirdo Comet 3I/ATLAS Taken From Multiple Planets</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, captured from both Earth and Mars, as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19. The comet, which has sparked speculation about its origins, was photographed by various space agencies including NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and China’s Tianwen-1.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it provides clearer data about the comet's trajectory and characteristics. Scientists have utilized multiple missions to track the comet, contributing to a better understanding of this interstellar object, which is the third confirmed of its kind. The latest images have allowed researchers to refine the comet’s orbital path significantly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently passing through our solar system.</li>
    <li>It will come within 269 million kilometers of Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>NASA's Perseverance rover photographed the comet in early October.</li>
    <li>The ESA's Trace Gas Orbiter and China's Tianwen-1 also captured images of the comet.</li>
    <li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter provided the clearest images of the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is over 4.5 billion years old, predating the solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Psyche mission captured images from 53 million kilometers away in early September.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Lucy mission followed up with images from 240 million kilometers away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early September, NASA’s Psyche mission took the first images of comet 3I/ATLAS from 53 million kilometers away. This was followed by additional observations from Lucy at a distance of 240 million kilometers. In early October, NASA’s Perseverance rover captured images as the comet passed Mars. Concurrently, the ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter and China’s Tianwen-1 also photographed the comet, contributing to a comprehensive data set.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches Earth, various missions have tracked its trajectory, culminating in the latest images released by NASA.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The ESA’s Mars data has sharpened the comet’s orbital path by a factor of 10. This provides the clearest confirmation yet that 3I/ATLAS is behaving like a comet,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object discovered. Its age and origin have led to various theories about its nature, with some speculating it could be alien technology. However, the latest findings suggest it behaves like a typical comet, contributing to ongoing research in planetary science and astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS nears Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. Ongoing observations will provide further insights into this ancient interstellar object.</p>
