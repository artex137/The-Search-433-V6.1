      <h2>3I/ATLAS stuns scientists with Sun pointing jet – what could it be?</h2>

<p>On November 9, 2025, scientists observed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS displaying unusual characteristics, including jets pointing toward the Sun. This discovery has raised questions about whether 3I/ATLAS is a typical comet or something more extraordinary. The observations were made by British astronomers Frank Niebling and Michael Buchner, who captured detailed images of the object.</p>

<p>The findings are significant as they challenge existing understandings of comet behavior. Researchers, including Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, are investigating the implications of these jets, which could suggest advanced technology rather than natural processes. Ongoing studies are planned to further analyze the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was observed between 5:08 and 5:22 UT on November 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is currently 326 million km from Earth.</li>
    <li>At its closest approach on December 19, it will be 269 million km away.</li>
    <li>The jets include two sunward jets and one long tail approximately 2.85 million km long.</li>
    <li>The density of the jets is a million times denser than solar wind.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 8, astronomers captured images showing seven bright jets emerging from 3I/ATLAS in various directions. Notably, some jets pointed toward the Sun, which is uncommon for comets.</p>
<p>On November 9, between 5:08 and 5:22 UT, Niebling and Buchner used two telescopes to obtain a detailed image of the object, revealing three main jets, including two anti-tail jets directed at the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Is the network of jets associated with pockets of ice on the surface of a natural cometary nucleus or are they coming from a set of jet thrusters used for navigation of a spacecraft? We do not know.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The characteristics of 3I/ATLAS differ significantly from those of typical comets. Normally, gas escapes from comets at around 0.4 km per second. In contrast, the jets from 3I/ATLAS are unusually dense and are suggested to be propelled at speeds much higher than normal cometary activity.</p>
<p>This discovery follows the observation of Oumuamua, the first interstellar object detected, which was significantly smaller and lighter than 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further studies using spectroscopic instruments to analyze the jets' speed, composition, and strength, which may determine the true nature of 3I/ATLAS in the coming months.</p>
