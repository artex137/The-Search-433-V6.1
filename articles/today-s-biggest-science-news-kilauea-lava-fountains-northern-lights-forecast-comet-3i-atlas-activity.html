      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Activity Reported Ahead of Close Encounter</h2>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have reported that comet 3I/ATLAS is becoming active as it approaches Earth for a close encounter on December 19, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This activity is significant as it marks the comet's increased brightness and potential visibility for amateur astronomers. Authorities, including NASA, are actively monitoring its trajectory and behavior as the date of closest approach nears.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are tracking the comet's activity as it approaches.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is becoming brighter, making it potentially visible to the public.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>As of early December 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of increased activity. NASA and ESA have been closely monitoring its trajectory and brightness levels, which are expected to rise as it nears Earth.</p>

<p>The comet's close approach on December 19, 2025, will mark a key moment for astronomers and enthusiasts alike, as it may become visible without the need for telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are excited to see 3I/ATLAS becoming active as it approaches Earth,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This provides a unique opportunity for observation and study.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a larger group of comets that have been observed by astronomers for their potential to provide insights into the composition of the solar system. Previous comets, such as NEOWISE in 2020, have captured public attention and interest in amateur astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor the comet's activity leading up to its closest approach. Further observations and updates are expected in the days leading up to December 19, 2025.</p>
