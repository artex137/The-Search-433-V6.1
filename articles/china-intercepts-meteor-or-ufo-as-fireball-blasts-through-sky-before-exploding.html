      <h2>China 'intercepts meteor or UFO' as fireball blasts through sky before exploding</h2>

<p>Social media users are speculating that a meteor or unidentified flying object (UFO) was shot down by Chinese forces after a fireball exploded in the sky over Shandong province on Friday, September 12. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident has garnered significant attention online, with various theories circulating about the nature of the event and the possibility of a missile interception trial. Authorities have yet to confirm any details regarding the incident, and local media have reported that residents heard two loud bangs resembling artillery shells.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date: September 12, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Shandong province, China</li>
    <li>Witness reports: Two loud bangs heard</li>
    <li>Social media platform: X (formerly Twitter)</li>
    <li>Footage: Multiple videos shared online</li>
    <li>Expert statements: Dr Alfredo Carpineti expressed skepticism about the meteor theory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 12, 2023, a bright fireball was observed moving across the sky in Shandong province. Footage shared on social media captured the moment the fireball detonated. Users reported seeing a small light intercept the fireball before the explosion occurred.</p>

<p>Following the event, various theories emerged regarding the nature of the fireball, with some suggesting it may have been a missile interception test. Local residents reported hearing two loud booms shortly after the explosion, which were likened to artillery fire.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Defense analysts say this fits a missile-intercept test,” said Tom Thompson, a self-proclaimed UFO investigator on X.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The problem is that it partly looks like a meteor until it doesn't. That's why I'm sceptical,” said Dr Alfredo Carpineti, an astrophysics expert.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows increasing interest in China's space programme, particularly its plans to develop capabilities for asteroid interception. Wu Weiren, the chief designer of China's lunar programme, has stated that the programme aims to defend against potential asteroid threats. Earlier this year, an asteroid named 2024 YR4 was detected, with the potential to collide with Earth in December 2032.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any ongoing investigations related to the incident. The status of the missile test allegations remains unverified, and no formal response from Chinese officials has been issued as of yet.</p>
