      <h2>Newest 3I/ATLAS Study Reveals an “Extremely Puzzling” Discovery: Why Does It Have So Much Metal?</h2>

<p>Researchers have discovered an unusual abundance of nickel and iron in the plume of gas from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, according to a new study released by an international team of scientists. The study, which details findings from observations made using the UVES spectrograph on the European Very Large Telescope in Chile, raises questions about the object's chemical composition as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges previous understandings of interstellar comets. Astronomers are now investigating why 3I/ATLAS exhibits properties that differ markedly from those of past interstellar visitors. The findings indicate that 3I/ATLAS may possess extreme characteristics, prompting further observations as it nears Mars this week.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently approaching Mars, passing within 29 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The study identifies a nickel-to-iron ratio in 3I/ATLAS significantly higher than in solar system comets.</li>
    <li>The comet has an estimated diameter of close to five kilometers.</li>
    <li>The object has an estimated mass of 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Observations are being conducted by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter missions.</li>
    <li>The highest-resolution images to date were captured by the Hubble Space Telescope from 570 million kilometers away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS has progressed as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initial observations began with UVES spectrograph on the European Very Large Telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Researchers conducted six intervals of observations as the comet approached the Sun, measuring distances ranging from 3.14 to 2.14 astronomical units (AU).</li>
    <li>On July 2023, Hubble captured images of 3I/ATLAS from approximately 570 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>Upcoming observations will be made as 3I/ATLAS passes Mars this week.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “At the distances at which comets are observed, the temperature is far too low to vaporize silicate, sulfide, and metallic grains that contain nickel and iron atoms,” the study’s authors stated. “Therefore, the presence of nickel and iron atoms in cometary coma is extremely puzzling.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The detection of nickel without iron is only known to exist in industrially produced alloys, made through the artificial carbonyl chemical pathway,” said theoretical physicist Avi Loeb. “Altogether, 3I/ATLAS shows a high production rate of nickel atoms as well as a high nickel to iron ratio, making it exceptional when compared to solar system comets and 2I/Borisov.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study follows previous observations of interstellar comets, including 2I/Borisov, which displayed some similar chemical signatures. However, 3I/ATLAS has emerged as significantly more massive and with a peculiar chemical composition, prompting scientists to reevaluate their understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, researchers expect to gather more detailed observations that could provide clarity on the comet's size, structure, and composition. Upcoming insights may either resolve existing questions or introduce new mysteries related to this interstellar visitor.</p>
