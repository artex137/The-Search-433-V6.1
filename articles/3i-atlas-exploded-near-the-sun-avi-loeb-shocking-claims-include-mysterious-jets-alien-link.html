      <h2>3I/ATLAS Exploded Near the Sun? Avi Loeb Shocking Claims Include Mysterious Jets, Alien Link</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a scientist from Harvard, has suggested that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may have exploded near the Sun during its recent passage through the Solar System. Observations indicate that the object exhibited unusual jets and significant mass loss, raising questions about its nature and potential alien connections. The claims were made in a blog post following the object's perihelion on August 6, 2025.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges existing understandings of comet behavior and has sparked renewed interest in the object. Scientists are preparing to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December, utilizing various telescopes to gather more data on its characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in the Solar System.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims the object lost approximately 2 million kilograms per second at perihelion.</li>
    <li>Loeb noted that previous observations indicated a mass loss of 150 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to swing closer to Earth in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Telescopes such as Hubble and JWST will be used for further observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been monitored since its entry into the Solar System. On August 6, 2025, significant observations were made during its perihelion, where it was noted to have lost mass at an alarming rate. Loeb's claims regarding the object's jets and possible disintegration were published shortly thereafter, leading to widespread discussion in the scientific community.</p>

<p>The object is projected to come closer to Earth in December, providing an opportunity for further analysis with advanced telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "When the Webb data was taken on August 6, 2025, 3I/ATLAS lost only 150 kilograms per second. The mass loss at perihelion derived above is 4 orders of magnitude larger, about 2 million kilograms per second."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb added, "Was the dramatic mass loss and brightening of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion evidence that it disintegrated? Breakup into fragments would have increased the surface area of its material. This would mean that 3I/ATLAS exploded at perihelion and we are witnessing the resulting fireworks."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims regarding 3I/ATLAS come amid a broader interest in interstellar objects and their origins. Previous encounters with such objects have raised questions about the potential for extraterrestrial technology and the implications of their behavior. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretations of these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth in December, scientists will conduct detailed observations to determine the characteristics of the object. Further analysis may clarify the nature of its jets and mass loss, and whether any of Loeb's claims hold merit.</p>
