      <h2>Since 2020, there have been at least five Christmas Eve UFO reports</h2>

<p>Since 2020, at least five UFO sightings have been reported on Christmas Eve in Washington State, with the latest incident occurring on December 25, 2023, in Tacoma. The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) has documented these sightings, which have not resulted in any reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>The reports are significant as they contribute to a broader understanding of unidentified aerial phenomena. The NUFORC, based in Davenport, WA, has recorded over 158,000 UFO sightings since the late 1940s, with 7,566 of those occurring in Washington State. Investigators have reviewed these claims, and none have provided a plausible explanation for the sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2021</strong>: December 24, Spokane, WA - 7:30 PM: Three orbs or colored balls traveling in formation.</li>
    <li><strong>2023</strong>: December 25, Tacoma, WA - 3:09 AM: Bright light shining into an upper bedroom, no noise, and no visible source.</li>
    <li><strong>2024</strong>: December 24, Chehalis, WA - 10:14 PM: A row of horizontal orange lights in formation.</li>
    <li><strong>2024</strong>: December 24, Arlington, WA - 11:24 PM: An illuminated orange orb observed, possibly a Chinese lantern.</li>
    <li><strong>2024</strong>: December 24, Vancouver, WA - 10:22 PM: A formation of lights flying semi-horizontal before disappearing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The modern UFO reporting era began in Washington State in 1947, following a sighting by pilot Kenneth Arnold near Mt. Rainier. Arnold reported seeing a v-shaped formation of silver objects performing impossible maneuvers. This incident led to the term "flying saucers."</p>

<p>In recent years, sightings have continued to emerge, particularly on Christmas Eve. In 2021, three orbs were observed in Spokane. The following year, multiple reports surfaced on December 24 across various locations in Washington, with descriptions ranging from bright lights to formations of colored orbs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If a plausible or provable explanation for the UFO is found, it is listed in the report. None of these have that,” a NUFORC representative stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The NUFORC has been collecting UFO reports since its inception, with many cases investigated and categorized as genuine. The trend of Christmas Eve sightings adds to the ongoing interest in unidentified aerial phenomena and the potential implications for aviation safety and public interest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NUFORC will continue to investigate these reports, seeking further information and clarification on the sightings. No additional details have been disclosed regarding the current status of these investigations.</p>
