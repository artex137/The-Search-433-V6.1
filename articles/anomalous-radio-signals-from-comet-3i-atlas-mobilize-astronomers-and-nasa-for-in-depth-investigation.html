      <h2>Anomalous radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS mobilize astronomers and NASA for in-depth investigation</h2>

<p>A recent detection of unusual radio signals from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has prompted a global response from astronomers and NASA. The signals, captured by the MeerKAT radio telescope array in South Africa, have initiated an intensive investigation involving multiple space agencies and observatories. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun in 2025, and the ongoing analysis of the data challenges existing models of cometary behavior.</p>

<p>This investigation is significant because it could redefine the understanding of celestial objects. Scientists are working to determine whether the signals arise from known natural processes or represent a cosmic phenomenon that has never been observed before. The urgency of the analysis stems from the unique opportunity to study an extrasolar body closely, as the peculiar nature of the signals demands thorough verification to eliminate any potential terrestrial or satellite interference.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma measures approximately 24 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>The MeerKAT radio telescope detected the signals in late 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA is utilizing resources from its Deep Space Network for monitoring.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be over 7.5 billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers identified comet 3I/ATLAS, confirming its hyperbolic trajectory as an extrasolar object. The comet's closest approach to the Sun occurred later that year, providing a unique opportunity for observation.</p>
<p>In late November 2025, MeerKAT captured the unusual radio signals, prompting an immediate global response from the astronomical community. Various observatories redirected their instruments to gather complementary data across different wavelengths.</p>
<p>In early January 2026, NASA announced the allocation of resources to monitor 3I/ATLAS, aiming to cross-reference the radio data with other observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anomalous nature of the signals requires rigorous verification to rule out any possibility of terrestrial or satellite interference,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS follows the discoveries of 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These interstellar visitors represent a new era in astronomy, enabling scientists to study objects from outside our solar system. Each comet provides valuable data that enhances understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the signals from 3I/ATLAS, exploring possibilities including unusual chemical compositions or complex plasma interactions. The ongoing investigation aims to validate the initial findings and deepen the understanding of this ancient comet.</p>
