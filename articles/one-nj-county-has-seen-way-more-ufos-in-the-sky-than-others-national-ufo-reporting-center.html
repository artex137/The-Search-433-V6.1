      <h2>One NJ county has seen way more UFOs in the sky than others: National UFO Reporting Center</h2>

<p>The National UFO Reporting Center has reported that New Jersey's Cape May County has recorded more UFO sightings than any other county in the state, with 128 sightings reported since 2000. The center, which has tracked thousands of UFO reports since 1974, noted that New Jersey has seen 77 sightings in 2023, with five additional reports in 2024 as of mid-February.</p>

<p>This information highlights the prevalence of UFO sightings in areas with varying levels of light pollution. Authorities and researchers continue to monitor these sightings, which could range from extraterrestrial vehicles to misidentified human-made objects. The center has documented these reports, aiming to understand the phenomenon better.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>77:</strong> UFO sightings reported in New Jersey in 2023.</li>
    <li><strong>5:</strong> UFO sightings reported in New Jersey in 2024 (as of mid-February).</li>
    <li><strong>128:</strong> Total UFO sightings reported in Cape May County since 2000.</li>
    <li><strong>61:</strong> Age of a woman who reported a sighting near Wildwoods Convention Center.</li>
    <li><strong>5 a.m.</strong>: Time of a reported sighting in Ocean City.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since 2000, Cape May County has seen a total of 128 UFO sightings, making it the county with the highest reports in New Jersey. In 2023, New Jersey had 77 reports, with the last reported sighting occurring on February 14, 2024, in Toms River. In the same year, a man reported a sighting while walking on the beach in Ocean City early in the morning.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I did not see it when I took the photo. I am mystified. I waited a few hours to report this simply because I felt foolish and would not be believed, but the camera doesn't lie,” said a 61-year-old woman who reported a sighting in Cape May.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This object was moving very fast, and that is why it caught my attention,” said a man who reported a sighting in Ocean City. “After passing over at a high altitude, it stopped dead in the sky for a second. I was shocked! It just stopped.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The National UFO Reporting Center has documented UFO sightings across the United States since 1974, emphasizing the impact of light pollution on the frequency of sightings. Areas with darker skies, such as Lincoln County in Nevada, have reported significantly higher rates of sightings compared to more populated areas like New Jersey.</p>

<p>In recent years, the term UFO has evolved, with many referring to these phenomena as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). A Pentagon study in 2023 found that over half of the cases studied were attributed to balloons, drones, or space clutter, though many cases remain unresolved.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The National UFO Reporting Center continues to receive and document sightings. Investigations into these reports will likely proceed as more individuals come forward with their experiences, contributing to the ongoing analysis of unidentified flying objects.</p>
