      <h2>NASA Photos of 3I/ATLAS Show Interstellar 'Spaceship' Targeting Meteors Along Its Path</h2>

<p>New images released by NASA in early October depict the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through the inner planets. This object is only the third confirmed visitor from outside the solar system ever observed. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its rarity and the opportunity it presents for scientists to study material formed around another star. NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet, despite some public speculation regarding its origin. The agency has stated that ongoing observations will continue as the object travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed.</li>
    <li>NASA released new images on 2 October 2023.</li>
    <li>The object is approximately 30 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
    <li>Observations have been made by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Lucy, and Psyche spacecraft.</li>
    <li>No evidence supports claims of artificial origin or targeted meteor interactions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 2 October 2023, NASA captured the clearest images of 3I/ATLAS using the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The object appeared as a faint, diffuse figure surrounded by a halo of gas and dust. Observations from other spacecraft, including Lucy and Psyche, confirmed its characteristics as those typical of a natural comet.</p>

<p>Following the release of these images, speculation about the object's nature surfaced on social media, primarily fueled by a blog post from astrophysicist Avi Loeb. Loeb questioned the brightness patterns of 3I/ATLAS, suggesting they might indicate artificial activity. However, mainstream astronomers have dismissed these claims, attributing the features to common observational effects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All available evidence indicates that 3I/ATLAS is a naturally occurring interstellar comet, not a spacecraft,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. The study of such objects helps researchers understand the development of planetary systems across the galaxy. Previous claims regarding the artificial nature of interstellar objects have often been met with skepticism from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey through the solar system. Scientists remain committed to studying the object’s characteristics and behavior to gain insights into its natural origin.</p>
