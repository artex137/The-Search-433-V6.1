      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Best Photos</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet discovered in early July 2025, has traveled over half a billion kilometers through the Solar System and has been actively photographed by various observatories and spacecraft. The comet was first observed on July 1, 2025, when it was 670 million kilometers from the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the characteristics and behavior of interstellar objects. Various space agencies have been monitoring the comet, capturing its evolution and trajectory as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at discovery: 670 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Distance traveled: over 500 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2025 (30 million kilometers away)</li>
    <li>Minimum distance from Earth: 270 million kilometers (mid-December 2025)</li>
    <li>Photographed by: ATLAS system, ESO’s Very Large Telescope, Gemini North and South telescopes, Hubble Space Telescope, NASA’s Psyche probe, MRO mission, SOHO observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS system. Two days later, it was photographed by ESO’s Very Large Telescope, which captured its initial features. Shortly thereafter, the Gemini North telescope provided images showing the gas shell surrounding its nucleus.</p>

<p>By July 21, the Hubble Space Telescope had determined the size of the comet's nucleus, estimating it to range from 320 meters to 5.6 kilometers. The comet was further photographed by the Gemini South telescope on August 27, revealing its visible tail.</p>

<p>In September, NASA’s Psyche probe captured images of the comet from 53 million kilometers away, refining its trajectory. On October 3, 3I/ATLAS came within 30 million kilometers of Mars, allowing for detailed observations by several space agencies. After a brief period of invisibility due to solar glare, the comet re-emerged in early November, with significant observations made on November 13 and 16, showcasing its tail and complex structure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations from various telescopes have allowed us to refine our understanding of 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the Solar System,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects. Its trajectory and characteristics provide valuable data for scientists studying the formation of comets and their behavior in different solar environments. Previous interstellar comets, such as 'Oumuamua, have raised questions about the nature of objects originating from outside the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth in mid-December, astronomers expect to capture even more detailed images of the comet. Observations will likely continue from various telescopes and spacecraft as it provides a unique opportunity for study.</p>
