      <h2>3I/Atlas anomalies: Its mass is likely bigger than 33 billion tons, too large to be a comet</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/Atlas has been determined to have a mass greater than 33 billion tons, according to a new paper by Harvard scientists Avi Loeb, Richard Cloete, and Peter Veres. The findings were presented after analyzing data on the object's movement collected over four months by the Minor Planet Center, with the trajectory checked by the International Astronomical Union between May 15 and September 23, 2025.</p>

<p>This research raises significant questions regarding the nature of 3I/Atlas, which has displayed anomalies inconsistent with typical comets. Despite these findings, the scientific community largely agrees that it is a comet, not an alien spacecraft. The study suggests that the object's mass and size exceed those of previously observed interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mass:</strong> Greater than 33 billion tons</li>
  <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> Larger than 5 kilometres</li>
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 60,000 km/second</li>
  <li><strong>Observation period:</strong> May 15 to September 23, 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Data sources:</strong> Minor Planet Center, James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope</li>
  <li><strong>Other interstellar objects:</strong> 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first spotted on July 1, 2025. Observations by NASA's TESS indicated that the object was detected as early as May 2025. The trajectory of 3I/Atlas was analyzed over a four-month period, culminating in the recent findings presented by Loeb and his team.</p>
<p>The analysis included 4,022 observations and measured non-gravitational acceleration, which was found to be smaller than 15 meters per day squared.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comparison to the expected sky positions provided a net upper limit of 0.028 arcseconds on sky position shifts during the 4.5 months between May 15 and September 23, 2025,” Loeb wrote.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The brightest point on the object has always remained centred on the nucleus,” he added, highlighting the stability of the observed features.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The origins of 3I/Atlas have sparked considerable debate in the astronomy community since its initial detection. While Loeb has suggested that the object could be an alien "mothership," most scientists maintain that it is a comet despite its unusual characteristics.</p>
<p>Loeb has frequently pointed out that given the limited reservoir of heavy elements in interstellar objects, many more smaller objects should have been observed before the discovery of 3I/Atlas, which adds to the discussion surrounding its classification.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the trajectory and characteristics of 3I/Atlas are expected as the scientific community continues to analyze its data and debate its classification.</p>
