      <h2>New measurements of the strange anticoagulant of comet 3I/ATLAS reignite the debate about the object's origin</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn renewed attention following its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Scientists have observed an unusual jet stream, known as an anti-tail, that appears to be directed towards the Sun, prompting discussions about the comet's origins and behavior.</p>

<p>This phenomenon matters because it challenges existing models of cometary activity and could indicate the presence of an unrecognized mechanism behind the jet stream. Researchers are now prioritizing observations of 3I/ATLAS to further investigate its unique characteristics and potential implications for the understanding of cometary phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The anti-tail has extended several hundred thousand kilometers towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope indicate gas moving over 5,000 km from the comet's core.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has suggested a possible technological driver for the jet's behavior.</li>
    <li>The comet remains a priority target for ongoing scientific observation and analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>December 19, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches its closest approach to Earth, attracting significant scientific interest.</p>
<p>Following perihelion: Researchers observe and analyze the unusual anti-tail behavior, noting its deviation from typical cometary activity.</p>
<p>Recent findings: New measurements have intensified the debate regarding the comet's origin and the mechanisms behind its jet stream.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behavior of the anti-tail challenges our current understanding of comet dynamics and raises questions about what drives this unusual jet stream,” said a spokesperson from the research team involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Cometary behavior has traditionally been explained through sublimation processes as comets approach the Sun. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its anti-tail, highlight the limitations of existing models and suggest the need for further exploration of alternative explanations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct additional observations of comet 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its composition and behavior, which could lead to new insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
