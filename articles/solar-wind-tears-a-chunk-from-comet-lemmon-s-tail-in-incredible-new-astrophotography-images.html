      <h2>Solar wind tears a chunk from Comet Lemmon's tail in incredible new astrophotography images</h2>

<p>Astrophotographer Brennan Gilmore has captured stunning images of the solar wind stripping a significant section from Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon)'s tail, as the comet brightens ahead of its close approach to Earth on October 21. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>Comet Lemmon, discovered on January 3, has brightened dramatically, raising expectations that it may become visible to the naked eye in October. Authorities and astrophotographers are closely monitoring the comet as it approaches perihelion, the closest point to the sun in its 1,350-year orbit, on November 8.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> C/2025 A6 (Lemmon)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> January 3</li>
    <li><strong>Close approach to Earth:</strong> October 21</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> November 8</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Currently +5.1 on the Comet Observation Database (COBS)</li>
    <li><strong>Location of images:</strong> Cismont, Virginia</li>
    <li><strong>Photographer:</strong> Brennan Gilmore</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, Gilmore recorded a significant disconnection event where the solar wind buffeted and stripped away a large section of Comet Lemmon's tail. The images were captured using a Takahashi Epsilon 130D Newtonian telescope paired with a ZWO astronomy camera.</p>

<p>On October 4, Comet Lemmon passed close to the bright star TW Leonis Minoris in the constellation Leo Minor, showcasing its glowing green coma and long luminous tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The solar wind is a constant stream of charged particles from the sun, which causes a comet's tail to always point away from it,” said Gilmore, explaining the dynamics of comet tails.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon's brightness has been noted in observations by the Crni Vrh Observatory in Slovenia, indicating that it could soon be detectable to the unaided eye from dark sky locations. This marks a significant moment for both amateur and professional astronomers as they prepare for its close approach.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astrophotographers and astronomers will continue to monitor Comet Lemmon as it approaches Earth, with hopes that it will remain bright enough for visibility to the naked eye throughout October.</p>
