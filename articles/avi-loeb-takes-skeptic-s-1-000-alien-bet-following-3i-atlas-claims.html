      <h2>Avi Loeb takes skeptic's $1,000 alien bet following 3I/ATLAS claims</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has accepted a $1,000 wager from Skeptic magazine publisher Dr. Michael Shermer regarding the possibility of alien visitation by 2030. The bet, chronicled in a blog post on Medium, has gained attention due to Loeb's claims about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which he suggests could provide evidence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This wager is significant as it highlights ongoing debates in the scientific community about the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence. Loeb has expressed optimism that the arrival of 3I/ATLAS and its unusual characteristics could change perceptions about the universe. Shermer, however, remains skeptical, emphasizing the lack of proof for claims of alien contact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb has accepted a $1,000 bet from Dr. Michael Shermer.</li>
    <li>The wager concerns claims of alien visitation by December 31, 2030.</li>
    <li>Loeb believes the comet 3I/ATLAS may provide evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence.</li>
    <li>The bet will be decided based on confirmation from two of the following institutions: NASA, the National Science Foundation, or the American Astronomical Society.</li>
    <li>Both parties plan for the wager proceeds to go to the Galileo Project Foundation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent events, Dr. Michael Shermer issued the wager through the Long Now Foundation's Long Bets program, which allows public predictions on various topics. Loeb accepted the bet, stating that the search for technological artifacts has intensified with the discovery of 3I/ATLAS. He has suggested that the comet's trajectory may indicate it is gathering information for an extraterrestrial civilization.</p>

<p>Loeb has noted that if 3I/ATLAS behaves unusually near Jupiter in March, it could provide evidence to support his claims. He has expressed hope that the discovery of extraterrestrial life could redefine humanity's understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The only way the conversation can change is if most reasonable people agree that we have a neighbor and something and a technological object that was not produced by us.” — Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<blockquote>“After 33 years of documenting UFOlogist predictions that ET arrival is imminent, I have yet to have proof of alien contact.” — Dr. Michael Shermer</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The wager comes amid a resurgence of interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Previous claims of alien contact have often been met with skepticism, particularly in light of a lack of verifiable evidence. The scientific community continues to explore the implications of interstellar discoveries, such as 3I/ATLAS, on our understanding of life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the deadline for the bet approaches, both parties will monitor developments related to 3I/ATLAS and any confirmations from the specified institutions regarding extraterrestrial intelligence. The outcome could have significant implications for future research and public perception of alien life.</p>
