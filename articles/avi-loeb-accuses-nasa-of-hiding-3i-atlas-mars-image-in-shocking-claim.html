      <h2>Avi Loeb Accuses NASA of Hiding 3I/ATLAS Mars Image in Shocking Claim</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has alleged that NASA withheld an image of the interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> taken near Mars on 2 October 2025. Loeb made the claim during an appearance on <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em> on 29 October and reiterated it in a post on X. As of now, NASA has not confirmed any capture or withheld image related to 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>This allegation raises questions about transparency in space research. Loeb has formally requested data from NASA regarding the supposed image but has received no response. His claims emphasize the need for scrutiny of potential technological signatures in space, which he argues should not be dismissed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Loeb claims the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured the image on 2 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb has not received a response to his data request from NASA.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object after &#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Loeb estimates 3I/ATLAS is 'a million times more massive' than &#699;Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency classify 3I/ATLAS as a natural interstellar comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 2 October 2025, Loeb claims that NASA's HiRISE camera captured an image of 3I/ATLAS near Mars. On 29 October, during his appearance on <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em>, he made public his allegations about the withheld image. He has since posted about these claims on social media, calling for further investigation into the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You don’t see a cometary tail here,” Loeb said, referring to the shape of the emission from 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Potential 'technological' signatures in space should be investigated rather than dismissed,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's assertions come at a time when interest in interstellar objects has increased, particularly following the discoveries of &#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. While some astronomers support investigating anomalies in space, others caution against jumping to conclusions without substantial evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb's claims remain unverified pending any additional data from NASA or peer-reviewed studies. Investigations into the features of 3I/ATLAS and its composition continue, with mainstream scientists advocating for caution in interpretation of the object's unusual characteristics.</p>
