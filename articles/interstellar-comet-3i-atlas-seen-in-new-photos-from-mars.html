      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS seen in new photos from Mars</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, has passed by Mars, with new images captured by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter on Friday. The European Space Agency (ESA) released the photos on Tuesday, showing a fuzzy white dot against the backdrop of space. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The appearance of comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object in our solar system. Astronomers and space enthusiasts have shown great interest in the comet since its detection in July, despite some unfounded theories regarding its origin. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the sun on or around October 30, but NASA has confirmed it poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 18.6 million miles from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter during the observation.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the sun on or around October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to emerge into view again by early December 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA has utilized the Hubble Space Telescope for monitoring during the summer.</li>
    <li>The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is a joint mission of ESA and Russia’s Federal Space Agency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers first detected comet 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter began observations of the comet on October 1, 2023, while it was approximately 18.6 million miles away. The orbiter captured images of the comet on October 6, 2023, and ESA released these images on October 10, 2023.</p>

<p>During this time, NASA monitored the comet with the Hubble Space Telescope. The comet is expected to reach its closest approach to the sun later this month and will become visible again from Earth by early December 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target,” said Nick Thomas, principal investigator for the spacecraft’s imaging system.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Every planet, moon, asteroid, comet and lifeform in our solar system share a common origin. But interstellar comets are true outsiders, carrying clues about the formation of worlds far beyond our own,” stated ESA officials.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows in the footsteps of two other confirmed interstellar objects: 'Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. These objects provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans additional observations of 3I/ATLAS in the coming months using various spacecraft, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the Parker Solar Probe. The comet will be monitored as it continues its path through the solar system.</p>
