      <h2>SPHEREx Imaging Reveals Increased Sublimation Activity on 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The SPHEREx observatory has captured new imaging of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, revealing increased sublimation activity since its closest approach to the sun in late October 2025. The observations were taken between December 8 and 15, 2025, and have shown significant changes in the comet's gas emissions compared to earlier data.</p>

<p>This discovery is crucial for understanding the comet's composition and behavior. The findings indicate a dramatic increase in activity, suggesting a new ice reservoir may have become active. Scientists are analyzing the data to gain insights into the processes occurring on 3I/ATLAS and its potential implications for future interstellar studies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date of 3I/ATLAS: July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun (perihelion): Late October 2025</li>
    <li>SPHEREx imaging dates: December 8-15, 2025</li>
    <li>Increase in CO emissions: 20-fold compared to pre-perihelion data</li>
    <li>Increase in H2O emissions: 20-fold compared to pre-perihelion data</li>
    <li>CO2 emitted flux: 33% larger than in August 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025. Initial spectrographic data was collected in August 2025, revealing minimal H2O gas and a CO2 coma as the comet approached the sun. During this time, emissions of carbon-based organic compounds were not detected.</p>

<p>Following its perihelion in late October 2025, SPHEREx observed the comet again in December 2025. The new imaging indicated a significant increase in gas emissions, with both CO and H2O emissions increasing by 20 times compared to earlier observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The CO emitted flux has increased ~20x, meaning that the CO/CO2 abundance ratio has also increased ~15-fold. This implies that a new ice reservoir is now active along with the one supporting the CO2-coma,” the study authors stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations of 3I/ATLAS indicated it was relatively inactive before its perihelion, with low levels of detectable gases. The significant change in activity post-perihelion highlights the dynamic nature of such interstellar objects and their potential for providing insights into the early solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the collected data from SPHEREx to further understand the sublimation processes on 3I/ATLAS and assess the implications for future interstellar research.</p>
