      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Captivates Astronomers as Other Comets Are Monitored</h2>
<p>Astronomers and sky-gazers have expressed excitement over the passage of comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> through our solar system. This interstellar visitor, older than our solar system, is only the third such object from outside it observed by astronomers. The comet has passed close to Earth recently, prompting significant online discussion.</p>
<p>This event is noteworthy as it highlights the ongoing interest in celestial phenomena. NASA and other agencies are currently monitoring several other comets, many of which are visible through binoculars or basic telescopes. Below is a list of five comets that sky-watchers can observe in the night sky.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon)</strong>: Currently in the constellation of Hercules, over 110 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
    <li><strong>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN)</strong>: Discovered on September 11, 2023, currently in Aquarius, over 51 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
    <li><strong>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS)</strong>: Over 129 million kilometers away in the Virgo constellation, closest to Earth on November 25, 2023.</li>
    <li><strong>Comet 210P/Christensen</strong>: Located in Scorpius, over 67 million kilometers from Earth, closest approach in 2037.</li>
    <li><strong>Comet C/2025 T1 (ATLAS)</strong>: In Ursa Major, over 173 million kilometers away, closest to Earth on November 14, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> has been observed passing through the solar system, generating interest in its unique origin. Other comets have been tracked as well, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>September 11, 2023: Comet <strong>C/2025 R2 (SWAN)</strong> is discovered.</li>
    <li>October 20, 2023: <strong>C/2025 R2 (SWAN)</strong> comes closest to Earth.</li>
    <li>November 14, 2023: <strong>C/2025 T1 (ATLAS)</strong> will be closest to Earth.</li>
    <li>November 25, 2023: <strong>C/2025 K1 (ATLAS)</strong> will be closest to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “In this photograph, the meteor's afterglow appears to coil around the comet's ion tail — a pure perspective miracle,” said <strong>Gianluca Masi</strong>, an amateur astronomer from Italy, referencing a recent image of <strong>C/2025 A6 (Lemmon)</strong>.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects. The monitoring of comets by NASA and other agencies has increased, particularly with the advent of better observational technology. The Oort Cloud, a vast reservoir of icy bodies surrounding the solar system, is often referenced in discussions about comet origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to monitor these comets, and sky-watchers are encouraged to look for them in the night sky. Upcoming closest approaches for comets C/2025 T1 (ATLAS) and C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) are anticipated on November 14 and November 25, 2023, respectively.</p>
