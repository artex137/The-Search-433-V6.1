      <h2>Harvard professor issues warning about comet 3I/ATLAS that may affect vacation plans</h2>

<p>A Harvard astrophysicist has warned that people should “take vacations before October 29” due to concerns about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is speeding through space. Dr. Avi Loeb claims that NASA may be withholding important information about the object, according to a report.</p>

<p>This warning has sparked online speculation and raised questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including NASA, have stated that the object poses no threat to Earth and will safely pass through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is roughly the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>The object is traveling nearly twice as fast as previous interstellar visitors.</li>
    <li>It emits a plume of nickel tetracarbonyl at a rate of four grams per second.</li>
    <li>No trace of iron has been found in 3I/ATLAS, which is unusual for such objects.</li>
    <li>Nasa has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 and has since baffled scientists with its unusual characteristics. Observations made using Hawaii’s Keck II telescope revealed the object’s unique chemical composition, prompting further investigation.</p>
<p>Dr. Loeb has raised the possibility that 3I/ATLAS could be artificial in origin, while NASA has reassured the public about its safety. Spanish astronomers have suggested a natural explanation for the object's behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Who cares about the communication departments? We want to see the data from the scientists,”</blockquote>
<p>- Dr. Avi Loeb, Harvard professor</p>

<blockquote>“Each observation is like opening a window into the Universe's past. It allows us to study the evolution of materials that were formed around other stars,”</blockquote>
<p>- Dr. Pérez Couto, University of A Coruña</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has divided the scientific community. Some researchers support Dr. Loeb's theories, while others advocate for caution and await peer-reviewed evidence. Previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, have also generated significant debate among scientists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the inner solar system. Further research and observations are expected to clarify the object's origin and characteristics in the coming months.</p>
