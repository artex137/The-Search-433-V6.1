      <h2>3I/ATLAS will zoom past Earth on Dec. 19—Here's how you can watch it</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 170 million miles, according to NASA. The comet poses no threat to the planet and can be seen with the aid of a small telescope, primarily in the early pre-dawn sky.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third interstellar object to enter our solar system. The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that during its closest approach, the comet will be on the opposite side of the Sun, ensuring safety for Earth and other planets. Observers will be able to view the comet near the star Regulus in the constellation Leo.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Closest approach of comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> 10.3</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope requirement:</strong> Aperture of at least 30 centimeters</li>
    <li><strong>Previous encounter:</strong> Passed within 18 million miles of Mars</li>
    <li><strong>Next encounter:</strong> Jupiter on March 16, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by astronomers and has since increased in speed following a close brush with the Sun. After its approach to perihelion, the comet was observed by ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE). Data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) has been used to accurately predict its trajectory.</p>
<p>The comet experienced increased speed due to the sublimation of its materials, releasing gas and forming a tail as it neared the Sun. Observations by various NASA missions, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the Perseverance Mars rover, have contributed to the study of this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“During its closest approach to the Earth, it will be on the other side of the Sun. It poses no danger to our planet or any other planets in the Solar System,” said the European Space Agency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It's a rare opportunity to compare ancient dust from a distant solar system to that from our own,” stated Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director of NASA's Astrophysics Division.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS is part of a series of celestial events occurring in December, including the Cold Moon Supermoon and the Geminid meteor showers, which are expected to peak on December 13 and 14. The Geminids will display approximately 120 meteors per hour during their peak.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the closest approach, 3I/ATLAS will continue its trajectory out of our solar system, with its next significant encounter with Jupiter scheduled for March 16, 2026. Data from ESA's JUICE mission is expected to be released in February 2026.</p>
