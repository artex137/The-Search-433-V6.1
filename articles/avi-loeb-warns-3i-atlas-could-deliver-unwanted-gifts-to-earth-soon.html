      <h2>Avi Loeb Warns 3I/ATLAS Could Deliver 'Unwanted Gifts to Earth' Soon</h2>

<p>Astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has raised concerns about comet 3I/ATLAS, a ~20-kilometre (12-mile) wide object, which will make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025. Recent images have revealed a complex jet structure, prompting speculation about its nature.</p>

<p>This situation is significant as it challenges the conventional understanding of comets and raises questions about potential risks to Earth. Authorities and scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS and plan to analyze its jets in the coming weeks to determine whether the object is natural or technological.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 20 kilometres (12 miles) wide.</li>
    <li>The object was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope network in Chile.</li>
    <li>New images were captured on 8 November 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>Another object, C/2025 V1, was discovered on 2 November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025. Since then, it has exhibited several anomalies, including non-gravitational acceleration and a blue glow. On 8 November 2025, astronomers captured new images showing at least seven jets firing from the comet. This has led to further speculation about the object's nature.</p>

<p>On 9 November 2025, Dr. Loeb published a follow-up piece discussing the implications of the new findings and emphasized the need for careful observation as the object approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Let us hope 3I/ATLAS will not deliver any unwanted gifts to Earth during the holiday season.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It would be easy to test whether 3I/ATLAS is natural or technological by measuring the outflow velocity, mass flux and composition of its jets during the coming month.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Dr. Loeb has argued that 3I/ATLAS has displayed unusual behaviors since its discovery, including anomalous acceleration recorded by NASA. The scientific community is divided, with some attributing these anomalies to natural phenomena while others consider the possibility of technological origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists plan to conduct detailed measurements of the object's jets to determine their composition and behavior. The findings may clarify whether the comet is a natural object or a technological probe.</p>
