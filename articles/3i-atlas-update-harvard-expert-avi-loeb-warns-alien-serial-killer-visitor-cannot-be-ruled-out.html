      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Harvard Expert Avi Loeb Warns Alien 'Serial Killer' Visitor Cannot Be Ruled Out</h2>

<p>On Friday, 19 December, the comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth, travelling at a speed of 130,000 mph. First detected on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile, the object has sparked significant debate within the scientific community regarding its origins and implications.</p>

<p>The impending approach of 3I/ATLAS has prompted heightened attention from astronomers and space agencies. Professor Avi Loeb from Harvard University has expressed concerns about the object potentially being an artificial creation, warning that humanity must remain vigilant as it approaches. The comet is currently about 170 million miles from Earth, roughly twice the distance of the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass closest to Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>It was first detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The object travels at approximately 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between 1,400 feet and 3.5 miles wide.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are monitoring the object with multiple spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Professor Avi Loeb has raised concerns about its potential artificial origin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>1 July 2025: The ATLAS telescope in Chile detects 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third interstellar object found in our solar system.</p>
<p>19 December 2025: The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth, passing at a distance of 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Alien technology is a potential threat because when you go on a blind date of interstellar proportions, you never know whether you have a friendly visitor as your dating partner or a serial killer,” said Professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya stated, “This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet. All evidence points to it being a comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Professor Chris Lintott from Oxford University dismissed the sensational claims, saying, “It is just nonsense.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The object is estimated to be eight billion years old, making it a relic from a distant star's formation. The scientific community remains largely skeptical of claims regarding its artificial origins, focusing instead on its natural formation as a comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, NASA and ESA will continue monitoring the object. The debate over its nature and implications is expected to persist as it moves beyond Jupiter and back into interstellar space.</p>
