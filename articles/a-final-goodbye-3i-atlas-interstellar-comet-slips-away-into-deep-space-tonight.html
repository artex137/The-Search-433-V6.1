      <h2>A Final Goodbye: 3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet Slips Away Into Deep Space Tonight</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar visitor, is making its final approach through the solar system and will vanish into deep space tonight, January 16, 2026. Astronomers are offering the public a chance to watch its last moments live.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object detected in our solar system. Discovered in July 2025 by an automated telescope in Chile, its high velocity and unbound trajectory have captivated scientists and space enthusiasts alike. The Virtual Telescope Project will livestream the comet's departure, allowing viewers to witness this unique cosmic event in real time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers (168 million miles).</li>
    <li>Livestream scheduled for January 16, 2026, at 5 p.m. EST.</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Final close pass by Jupiter expected in March 2026, at a distance of 53.7 million kilometers (33.4 million miles).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by an automated observing system in Chile. Its unusual trajectory and speed indicated its interstellar origin, setting it apart from typical comets. It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, and became brighter than expected. The comet passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, before its final departure.</p>

<p>As it heads towards the outer regions of the solar system, 3I/ATLAS will pass by Jupiter in March 2026 before entering the Oort cloud and continuing into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS is one of the most important discoveries of the last decade,” said Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows two other interstellar objects detected in our solar system: 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS has exhibited classic comet behavior, including outgassing, which contributes to its brightness and motion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its close pass by Jupiter in March 2026, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey into the outer solar system and eventually into interstellar space. It is unlikely to return for thousands, if not millions, of years.</p>
