      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS sparks speculation about extraterrestrial origins</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, a Manhattan-sized interstellar comet, has drawn significant attention from scientists and the public as it passes through our solar system. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025, reaching perihelion at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units, or 130 million miles (210 million kilometres), from the Sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant as astronomers capture the first optical images of the comet and study its composition. Authorities, including NASA, have stated that the comet poses no threat to Earth, passing at a safe distance of approximately 170 million miles. However, discussions about its unusual trajectory have sparked curiosity and speculation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>It passed at a distance of 130 million miles (210 million kilometres) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA reports it will pass Earth at about 170 million miles, posing no threat.</li>
    <li>The comet was photographed from Mars by China’s Tianwen-1 orbiter.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars occurred on October 3, 2025, at about 28 million km (≈0.19 AU).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS approached Mars, allowing for imaging by the Tianwen-1 orbiter. The comet then reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, as it slingshotted around the Sun. Astronomers have tracked its unusual trajectory, which has led to speculation about its origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s a real problem if it hits,” said Joe Rogan during a podcast episode with Elon Musk. Musk agreed, stating the comet could have the power to “wipe out an entire continent, or possibly worse.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“NASA initially assured that the comet would safely pass Earth,” according to reports, emphasizing that it poses no threat.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is classified as a truly interstellar object, indicating it originates from outside our solar system. The comet’s trajectory and composition have led to discussions about its potential connections to past extinction events on Earth. Speculation about its nature has arisen from its unusual movements and brightness.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. Research into its composition and trajectory is ongoing, with findings potentially offering insights into materials formed around other stars.</p>
