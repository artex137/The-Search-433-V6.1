      <h2>Military Whistleblowers Testify to Congress About Unexplained UFO Encounters</h2>

<p>Five military whistleblowers have testified about unexplained UFO encounters during a hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform on September 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C. The testimony raised concerns about the government's handling of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>The hearing aimed to restore public trust through transparency and whistleblower protection regarding UAPs. Eyewitness accounts from military personnel have prompted lawmakers to consider the implications of these encounters and the need for further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Witnesses: U.S. Air Force veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli, U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins, journalist George Knapp, U.S. Air Force veteran Dylan Borland, and Project On Government Oversight senior policy counsel Joe Spielberger</li>
    <li>Key testimony: Reports of UFOs exhibiting unusual behavior, including evading missile strikes</li>
    <li>Legislation discussed: UAP Whistleblower Protection Act</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the hearing, former Air Force intelligence officer Dylan Borland described an encounter with four lights that emitted static electricity. Retired Air Force officer Jeffrey Nuccetelli recounted chaotic radio communications as a UFO approached rapidly. U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins expressed concern about the unknown nature of these objects.</p>

<p>Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., shared an intelligence video allegedly showing a U.S. drone firing a Hellfire missile at a UFO off the coast of Yemen, claiming the missile did not affect the object. Burlison's statements and the accompanying video have led to increased scrutiny of military engagements with UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is something out there, and we should know what it is,” said U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins during the hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I’ve not jumped to the conclusion that I believe that there are aliens coming from another planet, but I’m open to that,” stated Rep. Eric Burlison, reflecting the mixed views among lawmakers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“How do we get to these other planets? How do we pass the Van Allen Radiation Belt safely?” asked Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., highlighting the challenges of investigating extraterrestrial phenomena.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent hearing is part of a broader trend in Congress to address UAPs. Lawmakers held the first hearing on UFOs in two generations in 2022, and subsequent hearings have taken place at an increasing rate. The establishment of a dedicated office to investigate military reports of unidentified objects has aimed to diminish the stigma associated with reporting such encounters.</p>

<p>Despite these efforts, some witnesses expressed concerns that the current framework for investigating UFOs remains inadequate, with agencies relying on stringent criteria for confirming extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress will continue to evaluate the implications of the testimonies and consider further legislative measures, including the UAP Whistleblower Protection Act, to enhance transparency and protect those who report UAP encounters.</p>
