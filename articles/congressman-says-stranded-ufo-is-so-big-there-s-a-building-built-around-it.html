      <h2>Congressman claims UFO is so large it requires a building</h2>

<p>Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison has stated that a foreign nation possesses a crashed alien spacecraft so enormous that authorities have constructed an "entire building around it." Burlison made these comments during an interview on Newsmax, where he expressed frustration over his inability to investigate the alleged craft personally.</p>

<p>This claim highlights ongoing discussions regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and the U.S. government's upcoming report on its research into these phenomena. Officials are expected to release significant updates later this year, which may shed light on the matter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rep. Eric Burlison made his statements during a Newsmax interview.</li>
    <li>He did not disclose the name of the country allegedly housing the UFO.</li>
    <li>Burlison has indicated he faces challenges accessing relevant facilities near Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Dr. Steven Greer, a UFO investigator, mentioned a similar craft located outside Seoul, South Korea.</li>
    <li>There are reports of multiple alien crafts, some described as larger than a football field.</li>
    <li>A Pentagon assessment has documented over 750 new unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) encounters between May 2023 and June 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, interest in UFOs has increased, particularly following comments from former President Barack Obama regarding the existence of aliens. In a podcast, Obama acknowledged that while aliens are real, he has not personally seen them.</p>
<p>Congressman Burlison's comments coincide with heightened scrutiny of UFO reports, especially with the U.S. government's UAP Disclosure Act of 2023. This legislation aims to ensure that classified information about UFO encounters is maintained to protect national security.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I'm having a difficult time getting access to facilities that are just within a few miles from my office in Washington, D.C.," Burlison said. "So, to try to attempt to go to another country and get permission at that level is going to be somewhat insurmountable." 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "If I come under any hard evidence, whether it's physical or video evidence that is absolutely definitive, I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe," Burlison added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "They’re real but I haven’t seen them," Obama said in reference to aliens. "They’re not being kept at Area 51." 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UFOs has surged in recent years, partly due to increased government transparency and public discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena. The UAP Disclosure Act of 2023 underscores the need to manage classified information to protect national security interests.</p>
<p>Recent assessments by the Pentagon have confirmed a significant number of new UAP encounters, indicating that this issue remains a priority for national defense and public interest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims made by Burlison and other UFO sightings are ongoing, with further updates from the U.S. government expected later this year. The situation remains fluid as authorities continue to assess the implications of these reports on national security.</p>
