      <h2>Hubble Tracks Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Jets</h2>

<p>The NASA Hubble Space Telescope has monitored interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, revealing unusual jet activity linked to the comet's rotation as it travels through the Solar System. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it helps astronomers refine estimates of the comet's nucleus size and document its evolving dust activity. Hubble's high-resolution images provide valuable insights into the comet's behavior, which is essential for understanding the characteristics of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
<li>The nucleus diameter is estimated to be between 320 meters and 5.6 km.</li>
<li>As of November 30, 2025, the comet was approximately 286 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
<li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of 209,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
<li>The comet remains visible to ground-based telescopes through September 2025.</li>
<li>NASA expects to continue observations for several more months as the comet heads out of the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS at a distance of about 420 million miles from the Sun. Following its discovery, Hubble began capturing high-resolution images, documenting dust activity and jet structures.</p>

<p>During an observing campaign from July 2 to September 5, 2025, astronomers noted jet features appearing on seven nights between August 3 and August 29, suggesting a rotation period of roughly 15 hours and 30 minutes.</p>

<p>On November 30, 2025, Hubble conducted a follow-up observation, tracking the comet while background stars appeared as streaks, providing further data on its activity and distance from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The swapping description centers on a pattern seen in cometary jets: as the nucleus rotates, different active regions turn toward the Sun, and the dominant jet can change,” NASA said in a statement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These changing jets are scientifically valuable: they offer a rare chance to compare how ‘fresh’ volatile-rich material behaves when it experiences intense inner-Solar System sunlight,” NASA added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being an interstellar comet, having originated from another star. Its study provides insights into the differences between interstellar objects and those formed within the Solar System. Previous observations of other comets have not revealed the same level of detail regarding jet activity and nucleus behavior.</p>

<p>NASA has coordinated with multiple observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, to enhance the understanding of 3I/ATLAS's size and composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS for several more months as it moves out of the Solar System. Future observations are expected to yield improved constraints on the comet's nucleus size and provide insights into its volatile chemistry.</p>
