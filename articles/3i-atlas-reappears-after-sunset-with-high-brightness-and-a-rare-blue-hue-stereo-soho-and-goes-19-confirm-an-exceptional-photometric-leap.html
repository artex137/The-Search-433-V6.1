      <h2>3I/ATLAS Reappears After Sunset with High Brightness and Rare Blue Hue</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been detected again after its conjunction with the Sun, exhibiting an unexpected increase in brightness and a rare blue hue. This reappearance has been confirmed by data from NASA's STEREO, SOHO, and GOES-19 missions throughout September and October 2023.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it presents an opportunity for astronomers to study the comet's behavior following its perihelion on October 29, 2023. Ground-based telescopes are expected to resume detailed measurements as the comet becomes visible again in the morning sky during November and December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Brightness increased to around magnitude 9 near perihelion.</li>
    <li>Expected visibility for ground-based telescopes starts in mid-November 2023.</li>
    <li>Measurements indicate a more pronounced brightness behavior than many inner solar system comets.</li>
    <li>The comet is not expected to be visible to the naked eye.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in Chile. Its interstellar nature was confirmed by the Minor Planet Center the following day. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2023, during which optical observation from Earth was not possible due to its conjunction with the Sun. Between mid-September and the end of October, space-based coronagraphs tracked the comet, confirming a rapid brightness increase.</p>

<p>As the Sun moves away, 3I/ATLAS has become visible again in morning twilight. Projections suggest that the comet will be accessible to telescopes starting mid-November 2023, initially with a glow around magnitude 11, gradually decreasing in the following weeks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The observed pattern is consistent with the presence of excited molecules near the cometary nucleus,” said Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams, researchers who conducted a comprehensive analysis of the comet.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet is noted for its unusual brightness and coloration, which has attracted significant interest from the scientific community. This event follows the discovery of other interstellar objects, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, and represents a unique opportunity for comparative studies of cometary behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet becomes visible, astronomers plan to conduct new observations to assess whether the gaseous component remains predominant and to monitor changes in the comet's brightness and activity following perihelion.</p>
