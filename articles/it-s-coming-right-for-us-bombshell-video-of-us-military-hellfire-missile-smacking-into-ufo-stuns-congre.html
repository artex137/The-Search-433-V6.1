      <h2>'It's coming right for us': Bombshell video of US military hellfire missile smacking into UFO stuns Congress</h2>

<p>A video showing a US military Hellfire missile striking an unidentified flying object (UFO) off the coast of Yemen on 30 October 2024 has shocked lawmakers during a congressional hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). The missile appeared to bounce off the object, which continued moving unharmed. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident raises significant questions about military capabilities and unidentified aerial technology. The video, shared by an anonymous whistleblower with Rep. Eric Burlison of Missouri, was presented during a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on UAPs on 9 September 2024. Lawmakers and witnesses voiced concerns about the implications of such technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: 30 October 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Video presented: 9 September 2024</li>
    <li>Presented by: Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.)</li>
    <li>Witnesses: George Knapp, Nuccetelli, Wiggins, Dylan Borland</li>
    <li>Technology involved: MQ-9 drone, Hellfire missile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 30 October 2024, a US MQ-9 drone fired a Hellfire missile at a UAP orb off the coast of Yemen. The missile struck the orb but did not cause any damage, prompting confusion among military officials.</p>
<p>On 9 September 2024, the video of the incident was shown to Congress for the first time during a House Oversight subcommittee hearing. Lawmakers and witnesses discussed the implications of the footage and its potential impact on national security.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That’s a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO, and it just bounced right off, and it kept going,” said journalist George Knapp.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Are you aware of anything in the US arsenal that can split a Hellfire missile like this…and do whatever blob thing it did, and then keep going?” asked Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.).</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The video provides exceptional evidence of UFOs,” said former Air Force military police officer Nuccetelli.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The hearing on UAPs highlighted ongoing concerns about transparency regarding military encounters with unidentified objects. Previous incidents, including the “Vandenberg Red Square” event in 2003, have raised similar questions among military personnel and lawmakers.</p>
<p>NASA has stated that it has not found credible evidence of extraterrestrial life and emphasizes that the origins of UAPs remain unknown.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers are pressing for further investigations into UAP encounters and greater transparency regarding military technology and its implications for national security.</p>
