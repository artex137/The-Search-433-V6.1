      <h2>Scientist makes 'extremely puzzling' find on 'spaceship' 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has discovered an "extremely puzzling" feature on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which he believes should not be present. This finding comes as the object, classified as a comet by NASA, has been closely monitored since its entry into the solar system months ago.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges the conventional understanding of cometary behavior. Loeb has raised questions about the object’s composition and has proposed theories that suggest it may not be a typical comet. NASA continues to classify 3I/ATLAS as a comet, despite the ongoing debate among experts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object 3I/ATLAS is categorized as a C2-depleted comet.</li>
    <li>Loeb's analysis indicates the presence of nickel and iron atoms in the comet's coma.</li>
    <li>Radio observations took place on July 2, 2025, over 7.25 hours.</li>
    <li>Nearly 74 million narrowband hits were recorded during the observations.</li>
    <li>Only 211 hits were found to coincide with 3I/ATLAS in the sky after filtering.</li>
    <li>The next significant milestone for 3I/ATLAS is expected in March 2026, when it will pass near Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, 3I/ATLAS has been tracked as it entered the solar system. Avi Loeb has published several theories regarding its unusual features, including the presence of metallic elements. On July 2, 2025, extensive radio observations were conducted, which yielded millions of data points. Following analysis, the majority of the radio signals did not align with the comet's position.</p>

<p>Loeb has since adjusted his stance, acknowledging the possibility that 3I/ATLAS may be a natural object, while still expressing the need for further understanding. His latest findings were shared in a blog update, contributing to the ongoing discourse about the nature of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“At the distances at which comets are observed, the temperature is far too low to vaporise silicate, sulfide, and metallic grains that contain nickel and iron atoms. Therefore, the presence of nickel and iron atoms in cometary coma is extremely puzzling,” Loeb wrote in his blog.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“At this point, given all the data that we have, I would agree that it’s most likely natural, but there are still a lot of things we don’t understand about it,” he told NewsNation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The vast majority of radio hits did not coincide with 3I/ATLAS in the sky,” Loeb stated in his update.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions about interstellar objects have often centered on their origins and compositions. 3I/ATLAS has prompted significant interest due to its unusual characteristics. The debate continues within the scientific community regarding the classification and nature of such objects, particularly in light of findings that challenge established cometary models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations are anticipated as scientists prepare for the upcoming approach of 3I/ATLAS to Jupiter in March 2026. The scientific community will likely continue to analyze data from radio observations and further scrutinize the peculiar findings associated with this interstellar object.</p>
