      <h2>Prof Brian Cox Reveals Fascinating Insights on Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Story</h2>

<p>Professor Brian Cox has shared insights on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traversing the Solar System. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by astronomers from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), this comet is notable for its rapid speed and significant eccentricity.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it represents a remarkable advancement in human understanding of the cosmos. The object’s eccentricity, measured between 6.1 and 6.2, confirms it as an interstellar object, making it the third of its kind ever recorded. Authorities, including the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, are actively observing 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Measured eccentricity between 6.1 and 6.2.</li>
    <li>Believed to have traveled through interstellar space for approximately 10 billion years.</li>
    <li>Possibly formed 7.5 billion years ago.</li>
    <li>Notable observations made by ESA and NASA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS team. Since then, its journey has been tracked through the Solar System as it approaches Mars and Jupiter. The ESA has successfully captured images of the comet as it flew past Mars using the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter.</p>
<p>NASA's Perseverance rover has also been tasked with capturing images of 3I/ATLAS, though confirmation of successful imaging is still pending. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission is set to image the comet as it approaches Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This represents a remarkable advancement in human understanding of the cosmos,” said Cox during an interview with the BBC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet serves as a time capsule, shedding light on the early universe,” Cox added, reflecting on humanity’s rapid progress in space exploration.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant in the context of interstellar exploration. It highlights the advancements in technology that have enabled scientists to track and observe comets from other planetary orbits. Just 400 years ago, humanity debated the Earth’s place in the cosmos, and now it has reached a level of sophistication that allows for such observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. Future observations will focus on capturing more data and images to enhance understanding of this interstellar object.</p>
