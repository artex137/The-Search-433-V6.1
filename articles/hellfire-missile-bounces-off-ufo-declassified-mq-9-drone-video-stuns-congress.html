      <h2>Hellfire Missile Bounces Off UFO: Declassified MQ-9 Drone Video Stuns Congress</h2>

<p>A declassified video showing a US Hellfire missile bouncing off a glowing orb over Yemen has shocked lawmakers during a congressional hearing this week. The incident, captured by an MQ-9 Reaper drone in October 2024, has raised significant concerns about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) and the implications for national security.</p>

<p>The release of the footage has intensified calls for transparency regarding UAPs. Lawmakers have stated that no known US or foreign technology could withstand such a direct missile strike. Representative Anna Paulina Luna, who presented the video, emphasized the need for answers, while Congressman Eric Burlison described the footage as “startling evidence” that cannot be ignored.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in October 2024 over Yemen.</li>
    <li>Footage recorded by an MQ-9 Reaper drone.</li>
    <li>Video presented during a UAP hearing in September 2025.</li>
    <li>Missile impact did not damage the object, which continued to move.</li>
    <li>Witnesses included lawmakers and veterans who described past UAP encounters.</li>
    <li>Nasa states there is no evidence linking UAPs to extraterrestrial life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone recorded a missile strike on a glowing orb in the skies over Yemen. The missile, a Hellfire, bounced off the object without causing any damage. This footage was declassified and presented at a UAP hearing in September 2025, where lawmakers expressed alarm and called for further investigation.</p>

<p>During the hearing, witnesses, including veterans, testified about their own UAP encounters, contributing to the urgency of the discussions surrounding the video. Representative Anna Paulina Luna highlighted the need for government transparency regarding UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The public deserves answers,” said Representative Anna Paulina Luna, referring to the declassified video.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Congressman Eric Burlison called the footage “startling evidence” that raises significant questions about current military technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Veteran journalist George Knapp warned that the secrecy surrounding similar videos poses national security risks.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The incident is one of the most unusual cases presented in an open session, according to sources. Similar videos reportedly exist but remain classified, raising concerns about the government's transparency and the potential need for disclosure. Past incidents involving UAPs, including a near-miss nuclear incident during the Cold War, have also been brought to light during discussions.</p>

<p>NASA has consistently stated that there is no verified evidence linking UAPs to extraterrestrial life, but lawmakers argue that unexplained encounters like the one in Yemen require further investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The release of the video has prompted renewed pressure on the government to demand full disclosure from the Pentagon and intelligence agencies. Lawmakers are expected to continue investigating UAP encounters and push for transparency in military operations related to unidentified phenomena.</p>
