      <h2>Trump moves to declassify federal files on UFOs, UAPs, extraterrestrial claims</h2>

<p>United States President Donald Trump has directed federal agencies to begin reviewing and releasing records related to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), UFO sightings, and claims of extraterrestrial life. Trump announced this initiative on Truth Social, stating he would instruct the Secretary of War and other relevant departments to identify and declassify files on these topics.</p>

<p>This move comes amid increasing public interest in UAPs and extraterrestrial life. Trump described the matters as “complex” yet significant. He emphasized the need for transparency regarding government knowledge on these subjects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump has directed the Secretary of War and relevant agencies to initiate the declassification process.</li>
    <li>The announcement was made on Truth Social, a platform founded by Trump.</li>
    <li>Trump criticized former President Barack Obama for discussing UAPs on a podcast.</li>
    <li>The U.S. Department of Defense released a report in 2024 stating no verified evidence of alien encounters.</li>
    <li>In 2023, the United States House of Representatives held a public hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recently, Trump made his announcement regarding the declassification of UAP-related files. This followed a podcast appearance by Obama, where he discussed the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Trump criticized Obama for his remarks, suggesting it was a mistake to address the topic publicly.</p>

<p>In 2023, a public hearing was held by the United States House of Representatives to address UAPs, indicating a growing interest in the topic across party lines. However, this hearing did not yield conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,” Trump wrote.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Obama reiterated on Instagram that while he believes the universe's vastness makes the existence of life elsewhere plausible, he encountered no evidence of alien visitation during his presidency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Public fascination with UAPs has intensified in recent years. The U.S. Department of Defense's assessment in 2024 concluded that most reported sightings were likely ordinary objects or misidentified phenomena. The 2023 House hearing on UAPs reflects a bipartisan interest in exploring these claims further.</p>

<p>Obama's comments during a podcast have drawn attention, but there has been no indication that he relied on classified intelligence in his statements regarding UAPs or extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Federal agencies will begin the process of identifying and releasing documents related to UAPs and extraterrestrial claims. Further investigations may occur as public interest continues to grow.</p>
