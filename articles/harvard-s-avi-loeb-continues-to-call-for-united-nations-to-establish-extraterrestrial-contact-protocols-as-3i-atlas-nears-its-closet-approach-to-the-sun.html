      <h2>Harvard’s Avi Loeb Calls for United Nations to Establish Extraterrestrial Contact Protocols as 3I/ATLAS Approaches the Sun</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has intensified his call for the United Nations to develop formal protocols for extraterrestrial contact as the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS nears its closest approach to the Sun. The comet, traveling at approximately <strong>130,000 kilometers per hour</strong>, is expected to make its closest approach soon, prompting renewed discussions about humanity’s preparedness for potential contact with intelligent life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>This issue has gained urgency due to Loeb's assessment that there is a <strong>30–40 percent probability</strong> that 3I/ATLAS could be an artificial probe. He notes that the object's trajectory and emissions significantly deviate from what is typically expected from natural comets. Loeb's advocacy highlights a perceived "policy blind spot of existential proportion," emphasizing that current global governance structures may not be equipped to handle first contact scenarios.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately <strong>130,000 kilometers per hour</strong></li>
    <li>Probability of being an artificial probe: <strong>30–40 percent</strong></li>
    <li>Location: Inner solar system</li>
    <li>Expert: Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li>Institution: United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has called for the establishment of extraterrestrial contact protocols as 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun. His appeal has gained momentum in recent weeks, coinciding with the comet's trajectory drawing closer to Earth.</p>
<p>Loeb has previously raised concerns about humanity’s preparedness for potential extraterrestrial contact in his 2021 book, "Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth," where he suggested that the interstellar object 'Oumuamua may have been an alien artifact.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The absence of a coordinated response plan is a policy blind spot of existential proportion."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb urged the UNOOSA to create "clear diplomatic, scientific, and ethical frameworks" for various contact scenarios.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's calls for a coordinated response to potential extraterrestrial contact highlight ongoing concerns about global governance. The UN has struggled to achieve consensus on critical issues, such as funding for peacekeeping missions and international conflicts, which raises questions about its ability to represent humanity in an alien encounter.</p>
<p>Without a legal or political structure in place, the question of who would represent Earth or what protocols would govern such an exchange remains unanswered. Loeb warns that this lack of preparation is not merely theoretical but poses a real risk.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb's ongoing advocacy may influence discussions within the UN and other international bodies regarding the need for a formal response plan for extraterrestrial contact. The timeline for any potential developments remains unclear.</p>
