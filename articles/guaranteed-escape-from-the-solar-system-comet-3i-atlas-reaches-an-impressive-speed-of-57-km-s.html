      <h2>Guaranteed escape from the solar system: comet 3I/Atlas reaches an impressive speed of 57 km/s</h2>

<p>A comet identified as 3I/Atlas has been confirmed as the third interstellar object to cross the solar system, traveling at an extraordinary speed of 57 kilometers per second. The comet, detected in mid-2025, reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units, situated between the orbits of Mars and Earth. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with its passage.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it offers a unique opportunity for scientists to study a celestial body formed in a different stellar environment. The analysis of 3I/Atlas has provided valuable data on the formation of planetary systems, and international observatories are actively monitoring its trajectory and chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS astronomical survey in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: 1.36 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Speed at discovery: approximately 221,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>First images captured by the Hubble and Gemini telescopes showed no signs of fragmentation.</li>
    <li>Comet's trajectory confirmed as hyperbolic with an eccentricity of 6.139.</li>
    <li>Next encounter with Jupiter expected in March 2026, at a distance of about 54 million kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS astronomical survey. Pre-discovery images date back to May 2025, but its status was confirmed by the Minor Planet Center. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, and had close encounters with Mars on October 3 and Venus on November 3, 2025.</p>
<p>Following its discovery, major telescopes were directed at the comet to capture detailed images and monitor its activity. An international observation campaign was organized between November 27, 2025, and January 27, 2026, to gather data and refine its trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The hyperbolic trajectory of 3I/Atlas confirms its interstellar origin, providing a rare glimpse into the formation of other planetary systems,” said a spokesperson from the International Asteroid Warning Network.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Its unique characteristics, such as its high speed and eccentric orbit, distinguish it from local comets, which typically follow prograde orbits.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it travels through the solar system, with a focus on its upcoming encounter with Jupiter in March 2026. Data gathered from this event will further enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
