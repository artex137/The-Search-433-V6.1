      <h2>Broad Haven UFO mystery could resurface after Trump pledges release of ‘alien’ files</h2>

<p>The 1977 Broad Haven UFO incident in Pembrokeshire may gain renewed attention after US President Donald Trump announced he will direct American agencies to identify and release government files related to extraterrestrial life and UFO sightings. Trump made the statement on social media, indicating that departments, including the Pentagon, will start the “process of identifying and releasing” files, citing “tremendous interest” from the public.</p>

<p>This announcement is significant for Pembrokeshire due to the Broad Haven incident's proximity to the former military installation at RAF Brawdy, located a few miles away. The base hosted both RAF operations and United States Navy personnel during the time of the sightings, raising the possibility that any unusual aerial activity could have been documented by the US military.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident Year: 1977</li>
    <li>Location: Broad Haven, Pembrokeshire, Wales</li>
    <li>Notable Witnesses: Schoolchildren and adults</li>
    <li>Reported Objects: Silver, cigar-shaped craft</li>
    <li>US Military Presence: RAF Brawdy, hosting US Navy personnel</li>
    <li>Previous Reports: Pentagon assessment in 2024 stated no evidence of extraterrestrial life</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1977, several schoolchildren and adults reported sightings of a silver, cigar-shaped craft near Broad Haven Primary School. These sightings became part of a larger wave of UFO reports in west Wales, often referred to as the “Welsh Triangle.” Over the years, the UK Ministry of Defence has released some UFO files, but no definitive explanation for the Broad Haven sightings has been provided.</p>

<p>On social media, Trump announced that he would instruct American agencies to begin identifying and releasing files related to UFOs. This announcement aligns with increased public interest in UFO phenomena, particularly related to the historical context of the Broad Haven incident.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Well, I don’t know if they’re real or not,” Trump said regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life. He also criticized remarks made by former President Barack Obama during a podcast interview, which had sparked global headlines about the possibility of life beyond Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Broad Haven incident remains one of the most famous UFO sightings in Wales. Despite various releases of UK Ministry of Defence UFO files, no conclusive evidence or explanation has emerged regarding the events of 1977. The ongoing interest in UFOs and potential extraterrestrial life has prompted researchers and residents in west Wales to look for new developments, particularly with the possibility of American archival records being relevant to the case.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future disclosures of UFO-related documents by US agencies will be closely monitored by researchers and residents in Pembrokeshire. The potential for new information could shed light on the 1977 sightings and their implications, especially given the historical Cold War connections to the area.</p>
