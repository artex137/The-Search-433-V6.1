      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Avi Loeb Argues Interstellar Comet May Be A Technological Artifact Like 1970’s Voyager 1</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard University astrophysicist, has argued that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be a technological artifact similar to the Voyager 1 probe. His claims come ahead of the comet’s perihelion on October 29, 2025, which has attracted significant attention from both the scientific community and the public.</p>

<p>This matter is significant because Loeb suggests that the study of interstellar objects should include technological artifacts. Authorities and researchers are currently analyzing 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Chile-based Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The comet's unusual features and trajectory have sparked debate among scientists regarding its true nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach its perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb has published anomalies related to 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may be a probe.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory is elliptical, similar to that of planets.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has an atypical anti-tail plume directed toward the sun.</li>
    <li>The chemical composition of the comet shows more nickel than iron.</li>
    <li>NASA is expected to release HiRISE images captured during the comet's transit near Mars in early October 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS in Chile. The comet's unusual elliptical trajectory and chemical composition raised questions about its nature. Loeb has continued to publish findings and anomalies regarding the comet. As 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion on October 29, 2025, scientists are preparing to analyze data from NASA's HiRISE images taken in early October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Most stars are billions of years older than the Sun, and during a billion years our Voyager spacecraft with its 1970s technologies can reach the opposite side of the Galactic disk."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also questioned, "Would comet experts recognize these visitors as technological artifacts if their training data set includes only icy rocks?"</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time interstellar objects have raised eyebrows among scientists. Previous encounters with interstellar bodies have prompted discussions about the potential for advanced technology beyond Earth. The ongoing debate about the nature of 3I/ATLAS reflects a growing interest in understanding objects that originate from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS and analyze the upcoming HiRISE images from NASA. The scientific community is keenly awaiting further data to support or refute the claims regarding the comet's potential technological origins.</p>
