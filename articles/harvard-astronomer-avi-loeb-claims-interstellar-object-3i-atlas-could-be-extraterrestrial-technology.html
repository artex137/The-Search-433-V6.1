      <h2>Harvard Astronomer Avi Loeb Claims Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Could Be Extraterrestrial Technology</h2>

<p>Israeli-born astronomer Avi Loeb has suggested that an interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS could potentially be a piece of extraterrestrial technology. The comet is predicted to pass about 267 million kilometres from Earth in December and measures approximately one to two city blocks wide. NASA has dismissed Loeb’s claims, stating that there is no evidence to support his theories.</p>

<p>This assertion by Loeb, a professor at Harvard University, has sparked discussions in the scientific community and beyond. He draws parallels between this situation and a recent incident involving Israeli intelligence, where credible data about an imminent attack by Hamas was reportedly ignored. Loeb warns that oversights in scientific inquiry could lead to dangerous consequences.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Predicted Distance:</strong> 267 million kilometres from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> 1 to 2 city blocks wide</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's Response:</strong> Dismissed claims as lacking evidence</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Comparison:</strong> Loeb compares current theories to an October 7 incident regarding Hamas</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has made public his theories regarding 3I/ATLAS, drawing attention to its unusual features and composition. He has pointed out that the comet’s path aligns with the ecliptic plane of our solar system, which he claims has a one in 500 chance of occurring randomly. Loeb has also noted that the comet is more massive than typical interstellar objects and has a composition resembling industrial alloys.</p>
<p>In a recent engagement on social media, Kim Kardashian expressed interest in 3I/ATLAS, which prompted Loeb to invite her to join his research team. This interaction received criticism directed at NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, who engaged with Kardashian but did not respond to a formal inquiry from Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While the probability of 3I/ATLAS being an alien artifact might be low, exploring such possibilities is essential,” said Loeb during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb compared the investigation of 3I/ATLAS to a “tennis ball tossed into one’s backyard,” emphasizing the importance of examining potential extraterrestrial technology within our solar system.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has faced mixed reactions from the academic community regarding his theories. He believes that some scholars are closed-minded and resistant to unconventional ideas. He recalls an incident where an editor accepted his paper on 3I/ATLAS but required him to remove a sentence suggesting that the object might be targeting our solar system, which he likens to historical suppression of innovative thoughts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions continue about 3I/ATLAS, Loeb remains committed to exploring the potential for extraterrestrial life and technology. He aims to inspire younger audiences to pursue science and maintain curiosity in the field.</p>
