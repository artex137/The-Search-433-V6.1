      <h2>Why scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS’s spin and trajectory</h2>

<p>Scientists have closely monitored the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS due to its unusual spin and trajectory since its discovery. This comet, which follows a hyperbolic path, provides insights into the behaviour of interstellar comets and their unique characteristics.</p>

<p>This monitoring is significant as it helps scientists understand comet activity and the forces acting on them beyond gravity. Authorities, including global observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope and ESA’s Mars Express, are collaborating to gather data that enhances predictions about the comet's behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has a spin period of approximately <strong>16.16 hours</strong> per rotation.</li>
    <li>Its orbit has a high eccentricity of <strong>6.1</strong>, indicating it came from outside our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is unevenly shaped, affecting its brightness and spin measurements.</li>
    <li>Jets of gas and dust generated by the comet can alter its trajectory.</li>
    <li>Collaborating observatories include the Hubble Space Telescope and ESA’s Mars Express.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, scientists have observed 3I/ATLAS's spin and trajectory. The comet's unique characteristics have prompted ongoing research into its behaviour and composition. As it approaches the Sun, scientists continue to track changes in its spin and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Studying the spin helps explain the small but significant forces acting on the comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Understanding spin and trajectory reveals not only how comets behave near the Sun but also clues about their makeup and history.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS challenges existing theories about interstellar objects. Its unusual features are prompting scientists to reconsider previous assumptions about comet behaviour and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will maintain close observation of its spin changes and trajectory shifts, which may provide valuable insights into outgassing, chemical composition, and potential artificial activity.</p>
