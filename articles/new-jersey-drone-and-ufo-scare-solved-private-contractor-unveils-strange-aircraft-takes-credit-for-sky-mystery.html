      <h2>New Jersey drone and ‘UFO’ scare solved? Private contractor unveils strange aircraft, takes credit for sky mystery</h2>

<p>A private contractor has claimed responsibility for last year’s drone and “UFO” sightings in New Jersey, according to a source present at an Army conference in August 2025. The contractor demonstrated a unique aircraft at the UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker, Alabama, where it allegedly showcased its capabilities in front of military personnel.</p>

<p>This revelation sheds light on a series of mysterious aerial sightings that caused public concern across New Jersey in late 2024. Authorities have been investigating these incidents, which had drawn attention from the Federal Aviation Administration and local law enforcement.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: UAS and Launched Effects Summit</li>
    <li>Date: August 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Fort Rucker, Alabama</li>
    <li>Incident: Drone sightings in New Jersey began on November 13, 2024</li>
    <li>Duration of sightings: Continued through early December 2024</li>
    <li>Aircraft size: Approximately 6 meters in diameter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 13, 2024, reports of drone sightings began over Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, New Jersey. These sightings continued across the state until early December 2024.</p>
<p>In August 2025, a private contractor demonstrated a manned aerial craft at the UAS and Launched Effects Summit. An employee of the contractor claimed to a small group that their aircraft was responsible for the previous sightings in New Jersey.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,”</blockquote>
<p>said an employee of the unnamed contractor, according to the source who attended the summit.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The sightings in New Jersey prompted investigations by various agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration. In January 2025, the FAA reported that many of the sightings were attributed to hobbyists and private individuals.</p>
<p>Fort Rucker, the headquarters for the Army’s Aviation Branch, implemented strict participation rules for the summit, including the exclusion of any drone or aircraft containing Chinese-made parts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to monitor the situation and have not indicated whether further investigations will be conducted based on the contractor's claims. No additional details about the contractor or the specific aircraft have been disclosed.</p>
