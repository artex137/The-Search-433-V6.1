      <h2>New Jersey drone and ‘UFO’ scare solved? Private contractor unveils strange aircraft, takes credit for sky mystery</h2>

<p>A private contractor has claimed responsibility for last year’s drone and “UFO” sightings in New Jersey during a demonstration at the Army’s UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August 2024. The contractor reportedly showcased a unique manned aerial craft that drew attention for its unconventional design and flight patterns.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it may explain the flurry of UFO reports that puzzled residents and authorities across New Jersey. The Army has not confirmed the contractor's claims, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has previously attributed many sightings to hobbyists and private pilots.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: UAS and Launched Effects Summit</li>
    <li>Date: August 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Fort Rucker, Alabama</li>
    <li>Aircraft: Approximately 20-foot wide, four-winged craft</li>
    <li>Initial sightings reported: November 13, 2024</li>
    <li>Duration of demonstration: Roughly 30 minutes</li>
    <li>Company involved: Not disclosed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 13, 2024, sightings of unidentified drones began over the Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, New Jersey. Reports of these mysterious aerial objects continued to surface throughout early December 2024.</p>

<p>During the UAS and Launched Effects Summit in August 2024, a private contractor demonstrated a unique aircraft that attendees described as unconventional and surprising. An employee of the contractor allegedly claimed to a small group that their craft was responsible for the UFO sightings in New Jersey.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” an employee of the unnamed contractor claimed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It feels like it’s a UFO because it defies what you’re expecting to see,” said a source, a military veteran and drone expert.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The series of drone sightings in New Jersey began on November 13, 2024, and continued into early December. The FAA attributed many of these reports to recreational pilots and hobbyists, while the Army has declined to comment due to the federal government shutdown.</p>

<p>Fort Rucker, the headquarters for the Army’s Aviation Branch, has enacted strict regulations regarding participation in events, including the exclusion of drones with any Chinese-made parts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the drone sightings may continue as authorities seek clarity on the claims made by the contractor. No further details on potential charges or next steps have been disclosed.</p>
