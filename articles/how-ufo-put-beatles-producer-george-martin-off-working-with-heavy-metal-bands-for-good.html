      <h2>How UFO put Beatles producer George Martin off working with “heavy metal” bands for good</h2>

<p>George Martin, famed producer known for his work with The Beatles, has revealed that his experience recording with the British rock band UFO in the 1980s led him to regret his involvement with heavy metal bands. This revelation comes from an interview published in the latest issue of Classic Rock magazine.</p>

<p>This story highlights the challenges faced by Martin during the production of UFO's album <em>No Place To Run</em>, recorded in 1980 at his AIR studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. Martin's reflections on this experience shed light on the contrasts between his traditional production style and the band's more relaxed approach, which ultimately influenced his future career decisions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>George Martin produced UFO's album <em>No Place To Run</em> in January 1980.</li>
    <li>The album was recorded at AIR studio on Montserrat.</li>
    <li>UFO's drummer, Andy Parker, noted that Martin worked with a strict timetable.</li>
    <li>Martin expressed regret over his “flirtation with heavy metal” after working with UFO.</li>
    <li>Martin did not produce any heavy metal albums after his work with UFO.</li>
    <li>Martin passed away in 2016 at the age of 90.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1980, UFO recorded their album <em>No Place To Run</em> at AIR studio in Montserrat. George Martin was approached to produce the album due to the studio's availability.</p>
<p>During the recording sessions, Martin and the band experienced a culture clash regarding their different working styles. Martin was used to a more structured approach, while UFO's lead singer, Phil Mogg, often delayed writing lyrics until the last moment.</p>
<p>After the album's release, Martin expressed regret about his work with heavy metal bands, noting that it did not align with his musical sensibilities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I once had a flirtation with heavy metal, and I regretted it very much,” Martin said in an interview. “It [the genre] didn’t seem to have any sense.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I think we made a good album, though sometimes it does come across as a little polite,” Mogg said, reflecting on the band's collaboration with Martin.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>George Martin is widely regarded as one of the greatest music producers in history, having shaped the sound of The Beatles and worked with numerous other artists. However, his limited experience with hard rock and heavy metal has been noted as a significant departure from his typical projects.</p>
<p>UFO, known for their energetic rock sound, had a different approach to music production, which contrasted sharply with Martin’s more traditional methods. This collaboration marked a notable moment in both Martin's career and the heavy metal genre.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are no current investigations or charges related to Martin’s experiences with UFO. His decision to avoid producing heavy metal in the future reflects a personal choice rather than a formal policy change.</p>
