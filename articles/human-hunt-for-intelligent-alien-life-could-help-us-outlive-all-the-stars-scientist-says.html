      <h2>Human hunt for intelligent alien life could help us outlive all the stars, scientist says</h2>

<p>Israeli-American physicist Avi Loeb has stated that encountering intelligent alien life could enable humanity to survive for trillions of years, longer than the lifespan of stars. Loeb made these remarks in a recent blog post, emphasizing the potential benefits of contacting technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilisations.</p>

<p>This assertion comes as part of Loeb's ongoing work with the Galileo Project, which aims to explore the existence of Extraterrestrial Technological Civilisations (ETCs). Loeb argues that science should not dismiss the possibility of alien life due to societal biases. His comments also coincide with the approach of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which may present an opportunity for further investigation into potential alien technologies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a Harvard professor and advocate for the search for extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object travelling at 60,000 km/second.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass Mars on October 3, 2025, and reach perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million km.</li>
    <li>The Galileo Project was initiated to investigate the existence of ETCs.</li>
    <li>Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS may not be a natural comet but rather a probe from an advanced alien race.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, Avi Loeb has discussed the implications of finding intelligent alien life. His statements have raised interest in the potential of 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object approaching the inner solar system. The object is scheduled to pass Mars on October 3, 2025, with significant observations planned from various space missions.</p>

<p>Loeb's insights suggest that advanced alien civilisations may hold the key to humanity's long-term survival, particularly during future cosmic events. He has proposed that these civilisations could even create artificial stars to help sustain life in the universe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Finding extraterrestrial siblings would inspire us to reach out beyond the limited experiences we have had so far on our home planet. There are richer opportunities in our cosmic street than available at home,” said Loeb.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Humans could join a camping site of intelligent beings around an artificial source of heat, allowing humanity to survive the future cosmic winter for potentially more than ten trillion years, the longest lifespan of stars,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has been a prominent figure in the search for extraterrestrial life, advocating for a more open-minded approach to the possibilities of alien civilisations. His research has sparked discussions about the implications of advanced technologies and the potential for human longevity in the universe.</p>

<p>The Galileo Project represents a significant shift in scientific inquiry, as it seeks to explore evidence of extraterrestrial technology without preconceived biases. Loeb's theories about 3I/ATLAS further emphasize the need for careful observation and analysis of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are preparing to observe 3I/ATLAS closely during its approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. Various space missions will utilize their cameras to gather data on the object, which could provide insights into its nature and origins.</p>
