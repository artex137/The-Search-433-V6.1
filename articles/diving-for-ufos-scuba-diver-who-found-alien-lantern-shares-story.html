      <h2>Diving for UFOs: Scuba Diver Who Found ‘Alien’ Lantern Shares Story</h2>

<p>Mark Stamey, a 26-year-old scuba diver, discovered a glowing railroad lantern in a mining pond in Carbondale, Pennsylvania, on November 10, 1974, while searching for what was believed to be a crashed UFO. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the incident.</p>

<p>The discovery has become part of local lore, leading to the second annual Carbondalien Festival starting this weekend in downtown Carbondale. The event celebrates the legend that has persisted despite police determining the incident was a hoax, originally caused by a teenager's prank. Authorities have not disclosed any current investigations into the incident.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: November 10, 1974</li>
    <li>Location: Russell Park, Carbondale, Pennsylvania</li>
    <li>Discovery time: Approximately 2:45 a.m.</li>
    <li>Object found: Railroad lantern, still glowing</li>
    <li>Involvement: Local police, military personnel, UFO researchers</li>
    <li>Festival dates: November 10-11, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the evening of November 9, 1974, around 7 p.m., a group of teenagers reported seeing a glowing object cross over Salem Mountain and crash into the mining pond. Police were called to the scene approximately two hours later.</p>

<p>At around 2:45 a.m. on November 10, searchers in a boat hooked an object in the water, but the object fell and the light went out as it was being raised. Stamey entered the water later that morning, leading to the discovery of the lantern.</p>

<p>By November 11, police declared the incident a hoax, revealing the lantern had been tossed into the pond by one of the teenagers to scare his sister. Despite this, the story gained national attention and remains a celebrated part of local history.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This can’t be … ” Stamey started to say, but a shout of ‘We found it!’ cut him off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“All that glitters is not gold... all that glitters isn’t a flying saucer either,” reported a Scranton Times journalist on November 12, 1974.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Carbondalien incident has become a cultural touchstone for the city, drawing comparisons to the Roswell UFO incident. Over the years, local residents have speculated about the possibility of actual extraterrestrial encounters, despite the police's conclusion regarding the hoax.</p>

<p>The annual Carbondalien Festival continues to attract interest, blending local history with the allure of UFO mythology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Carbondalien Festival will take place from November 10-11, 2025, featuring a parade and concert, as the community continues to celebrate the legacy of the incident.</p>
