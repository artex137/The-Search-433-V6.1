      <h2>New Bright Comet Expected to Adorn the Skies in April</h2>

<p>A new comet, cataloged as C/2026 A1 (MAPS), has been discovered at the AMACS1 observatory in San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, on January 13, 2026. The comet is expected to reach perihelion in early April, passing just 99,600 miles (160,200 km) above the sun's surface.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as the MAPS Comet is part of the Kreutz comet family, known for producing exceptionally bright objects that can be seen from Earth. Astronomers are closely monitoring its trajectory and brightness, with expectations that it may become visible to the naked eye in mid-April.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on January 13, 2026, at AMACS1 observatory.</li>
    <li>Located 191 million miles (308 million km) from the sun at discovery.</li>
    <li>Expected to reach perihelion in early April 2026.</li>
    <li>Will pass 99,600 miles (160,200 km) above the sun's photosphere.</li>
    <li>Estimated travel speed during perihelion: over 2 million miles (3 million km) per hour.</li>
    <li>Magnitude at discovery: +17.8, indicating a very faint object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The MAPS Comet was first observed on January 13, 2026, using an 11-inch (0.28 meters) f/2.2 Schmidt telescope. Pre-discovery images taken in December 2025 helped determine its orbit, confirming its membership in the Kreutz group of comets. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the sun in early April, with its brightness being evaluated in the weeks leading up to this event.</p>

<p>Historically, Kreutz comets have been known to break apart and produce bright displays, the last notable example being the comet Ikeya-Seki in 1965.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We will need a few more weeks to determine whether the MAPS Comet develops into a potentially bright object or will remain small and faint,” said a spokesperson from the AMACS1 observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Kreutz group of comets has a long history, with origins believed to trace back to a large comet that fragmented around 371 BC. This group has produced several notable comets that have been visible during daylight. The understanding of these comets has evolved, with modern astronomers recognizing their shared lineage and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the MAPS Comet approaches perihelion, astronomers will continue to monitor its brightness and trajectory. By early March, they expect to have a clearer understanding of its potential visibility to the naked eye in April.</p>
