      <h2>NASA’s Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: New Images, Life’s Ingredients and What Comes Next After the December Flyby</h2>

<p>As of December 10, 2025, NASA and partner observatories have reported new findings about interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through our solar system. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, the comet is noted for its green glow and for being rich in chemical compounds that are essential for life.</p>

<p>The study of comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are actively monitoring the comet, which is on a hyperbolic trajectory and poses no risk to Earth. Observations have revealed that the comet contains methanol and hydrogen cyanide, which are important for prebiotic chemistry.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered By:</strong> ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles or 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approached Earth at speeds of up to 246,000 km/h (153,000 mph)</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Nucleus estimated to be between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers across</li>
    <li><strong>Methanol Composition:</strong> Approximately 8% of vapor from the comet</li>
    <li><strong>Hydrogen Cyanide Presence:</strong> An unusually high abundance noted</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has followed a significant path through our solar system:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>July 1, 2025:</strong> Discovered by ATLAS in Chile, initially observed as a faint object moving toward the Milky Way.</li>
    <li><strong>October 3, 2025:</strong> Passed 0.19 AU (about 29 million km) from Mars, with ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars capturing images and refining its trajectory.</li>
    <li><strong>October 29, 2025:</strong> Reached perihelion, passing just inside Mars' orbit and tracked by multiple spacecraft.</li>
    <li><strong>November 2025:</strong> Emerged from solar conjunction; observed by ESA’s Juice and NASA’s heliophysics missions.</li>
    <li><strong>December 19, 2025:</strong> Scheduled closest approach to Earth at approximately 1.8 AU.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS shows that it is unusually rich in methanol and hydrogen cyanide,” said a NASA-led team utilizing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such objects is crucial for understanding the origins of organic materials and water on planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS for several more months as it moves outward from the inner solar system. Additional data from various spacecraft, including ESA’s Juice, is expected to arrive in early 2026.</p>
