      <h2>3I/ATLAS Radio Scan: Most Sensitive Alien Search Ever Ends With Shock Result</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile, has concluded the most sensitive radio search for alien signals ever conducted. The search, which took place on 18 December 2025, yielded no evidence of extraterrestrial technology, according to the Breakthrough Listen project.</p>

<p>This search is significant as it represents a new benchmark in the quest for signs of advanced civilizations beyond Earth. Despite initial excitement over the detection of over 471,000 candidate signals, further analysis revealed these were false positives caused by terrestrial interference, leading to a definitive conclusion of no detectable signals from the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet approached Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometres on 18 December 2025.</li>
    <li>The search utilized the 100-metre Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia.</li>
    <li>The search scanned across four radio bands ranging from 1 to 12 GHz.</li>
    <li>Initially, 471,000 candidate signals were detected; narrowed down to nine signals.</li>
    <li>No isotropic continuous-wave transmitters were found broadcasting above 0.1 watts.</li>
    <li>The study was detailed in the arXiv preprint server.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was first detected, igniting interest in its potential as a source of extraterrestrial signals. As it approached Earth, the Breakthrough Listen project prepared to conduct a sensitive radio search.</p>

<p>On 18 December 2025, the Green Bank Telescope was pointed at the comet, marking the start of the search. Initial findings indicated a large number of candidate signals, but subsequent analysis revealed they were not genuine.</p>

<p>Eventually, the study confirmed that 3I/ATLAS did not emit any detectable signals indicative of advanced technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is currently no evidence to suggest that ISOs are anything other than natural astrophysical objects,” the authors of the study noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows in the footsteps of previous interstellar visitors such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov. These encounters have heightened interest in the search for technosignatures, which are considered potential indicators of advanced civilizations.</p>

<p>The recent search has set a new standard for future investigations, refining methods to distinguish genuine signals from background noise.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey away from the solar system, the scientific community plans to enhance detection techniques and utilize upcoming technologies, such as the Square Kilometre Array, to improve future searches for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
