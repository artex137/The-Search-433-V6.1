      <h2>Study reveals that cosmic rays altered the surface of comet 3I/ATLAS in billions of years</h2>

<p>A study published on arXiv has shown that the surface of comet 3I/ATLAS has undergone significant alterations due to prolonged exposure to galactic cosmic rays during billions of years of interstellar travel. The comet was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Hawaii and is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the Solar System, following 1I/Ê»Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>This research is important as it suggests that the outer layer of 3I/ATLAS, estimated to be between 15 to 20 meters thick, no longer preserves the original material from its home star system. Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) indicate a high carbon dioxide to water ratio, which is significantly different from local comets. Scientists aim to further study the implications of these findings for understanding the composition of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached on October 29, 2025, at 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>CO₂/H₂O ratio measured at 7.6 ± 0.3, indicating a significant alteration of surface materials.</li>
    <li>Research conducted by the Royal Belgian Institute of Space Aeronomy.</li>
    <li>First radio signal detected by MeerKAT on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>New measurements scheduled for December 2025 to assess deeper layers of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS system in Hawaii in July 2025. Observations from the JWST in August 2025 revealed its unique surface composition while it was 445 million kilometers from Earth. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope captured the first radio signal from the comet. Images from the Gemini South Observatory taken on August 27, 2025, showed a bluish coma resulting from heating carbon molecules.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The irradiated crust masks primordial traces, making the comet a record of the effects of the interstellar medium rather than its original formation,” researchers stated in the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies of interstellar objects have focused on their original materials. However, the findings regarding 3I/ATLAS suggest a need to prioritize analyses of radiation processing in long-residence interstellar bodies. This study integrates data from JWST/NIRSpec and SPHEREx, confirming extreme CO₂ enrichment as a signature of billions of years of cosmic irradiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further measurements are scheduled for December 2025 to evaluate whether sublimation of the comet will reveal deeper, less altered layers of material. Scientists will continue to monitor the comet's activity and composition as it travels through the Solar System.</p>
