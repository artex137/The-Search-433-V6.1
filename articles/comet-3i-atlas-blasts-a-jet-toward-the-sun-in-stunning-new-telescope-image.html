      <h2>Comet 3I ATLAS Blasts a Jet Toward the Sun in Stunning New Telescope Image</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured an image of comet 3I ATLAS, an interstellar object, as it blasts a jet of gas and dust toward the sun. The discovery, confirmed by observatories in Hawaii and the Canary Islands, was published on October 25, 2025.</p>

<p>This observation has generated renewed interest in these rare celestial visitors. Comet 3I ATLAS is the third interstellar comet detected, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. As it approaches the inner solar system, it is warming rapidly, triggering a visible jet eruption.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS is currently traveling through our solar system.</li>
    <li>The jet extends approximately 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) from the comet's surface.</li>
    <li>The discovery was confirmed by the Two-meter Twin Telescope at Teide Observatory in Tenerife and the Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>The image was produced from 159 exposures, each lasting 50 seconds, taken on August 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and dust.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 2, 2025, astronomers captured multiple exposures of comet 3I ATLAS. Advanced image-processing techniques were employed to create a composite image showcasing the comet’s jet. The findings were reported in the Astronomer’s Telegram, a service for sharing time-sensitive discoveries.</p>
<p>The observation was confirmed by telescopes in both Hawaii and the Canary Islands, drawing attention to the comet's unique characteristics and interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is typical behavior for active comets,” said Miquel Serra-Ricart, chief science officer at Light Bridges Research and lead observer for the project. “But what makes 3I ATLAS special is that it’s not from our solar system — it’s an interstellar traveler passing through.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Studying interstellar comets like 3I ATLAS helps us understand how materials form and evolve in other planetary systems,” noted planetary scientist Karin Meech of the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS is notable for its interstellar origin, differing from comets that originate from our Oort Cloud. Its high velocity and unusual trajectory confirm that it entered our solar system from deep space and will eventually exit it without returning.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I ATLAS as it approaches the sun. The current jet eruption may not be the last, with expectations of more jets forming as the comet heats up further.</p>
