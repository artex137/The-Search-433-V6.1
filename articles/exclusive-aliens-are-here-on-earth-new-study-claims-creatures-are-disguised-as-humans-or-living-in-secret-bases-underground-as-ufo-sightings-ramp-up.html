      <h2>Aliens 'Are Here On Earth' — New Study Claims Creatures are 'Disguised as Humans' or 'Living In Secret Bases Underground'</h2>

<p>A new study from Harvard University suggests that extraterrestrial beings are already on Earth, disguised as humans or residing in hidden underground bases, according to a report by RadarOnline.com. The paper, co-authored by Montana Technological University professor Michael Masters and Harvard researchers Tim Lomas and Brendan Case, theorizes that these aliens could be remnants of an ancient civilization or time-travelers from the future.</p>

<p>This study has raised significant interest amid a surge in UFO sightings, with the Pentagon currently investigating approximately 1,650 reports, nearly half of which have occurred between May 2023 and June 2024. The military has denied any claims of these sightings being of alien origin, despite some reported aerial phenomena exceeding known technological capabilities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study published by Harvard University researchers in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Pentagon investigating 1,650 UFO sightings.</li>
    <li>Close to half of sightings reported between May 2023 and June 2024.</li>
    <li>Paper taken down from ResearchGate shortly after publication.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In mid-July 2023, a study co-authored by Michael Masters, Tim Lomas, and Brendan Case proposed that aliens are living among humans. Following its publication, the paper was removed from ResearchGate, prompting speculation about a possible cover-up.</p>
<p>Since May 2023, the Pentagon has documented a significant increase in UFO sightings, with military officials actively investigating these reports. The timeline of events has led to heightened public interest in the potential existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re not saying this is right, we’re not saying that this is absolutely 100 percent the case,” said Michael Masters. “We’re saying these are some potentialities.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Bill Birnes, author of <em>UFOs and the White House</em>, stated, “I believe they have infiltrated the highest reaches of governments across the globe.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this study, claims of alien encounters and sightings have circulated for decades, with various experts asserting that extraterrestrials may have lived on Earth for millennia. Dr. Birnes has long maintained that aliens resembling humans have been present on Earth since ancient times, contributing to ongoing speculation and research in the field of ufology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations by the Pentagon into UFO sightings are ongoing, with no set deadlines for completion. The scientific community may continue to explore the implications of the recent study as public interest in the topic remains high.</p>
