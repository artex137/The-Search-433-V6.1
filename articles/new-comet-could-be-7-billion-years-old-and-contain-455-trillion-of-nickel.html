      <h2>New Comet Could Be 7 Billion Years Old And Contain $455 Trillion of Nickel</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered a new comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, which they believe could be up to 7 billion years old and may contain significant amounts of nickel. The comet, which is currently passing through our solar system, was identified by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) based in Chile. As of now, there are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This comet is of particular interest to scientists because it is one of only three known interstellar objects observed in our solar system. Its potential value, estimated at $455 trillion based on current nickel prices, has sparked discussions about the future of space mining, although experts caution that practical extraction remains far off. Authorities and astronomers are focusing on studying the comet's composition and origins rather than its economic value.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS weighs approximately 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Nickel is currently priced at $6.90 per pound.</li>
    <li>Estimated potential value of the comet is $455 trillion.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to the sun on October 29, at a distance of 126 million miles.</li>
    <li>The comet is over 420 million miles away from the sun, more than four times the distance from Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is about half a kilometer in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS in Chile. Since then, astronomers have been monitoring its trajectory and composition. The comet will reach its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2025.</p>
<p>Experts like Max Gilbraith from the University of Wyoming have weighed in on the comet's composition and its implications for scientific research, noting the unique characteristics that differentiate it from typical comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s the third interstellar comet we’ve discovered,” said Max Gilbraith. “We’ve seen three of these comets in eight years.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Gilbraith expressed skepticism about the claim of the comet being made of “pure nickel,” stating, “You have to be careful about your verbiage.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are typically composed of dust and volatile ices, differentiating them from asteroids, which are primarily made of rock and metals. Most comets observed historically have originated within our solar system, making 3I/ATLAS's interstellar origin particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Gilbraith explained that the nickel-to-iron ratio in 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into its age and origin, as these elements behave differently during the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, with a focus on its unique light spectrum and composition. Further analysis, including ultraviolet imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope planned for November, will help determine the true ratio of nickel to iron in the comet.</p>
