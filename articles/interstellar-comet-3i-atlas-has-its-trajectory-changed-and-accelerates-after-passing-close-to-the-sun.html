      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has its trajectory changed and accelerates after passing close to the Sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object ever identified, has undergone a significant change in trajectory and speed after passing close to the Sun in October 2025. NASA has confirmed that the comet will exit the solar system and is not expected to return.</p>

<p>The comet's hyperbolic orbit indicates that the Sun's gravity was insufficient to capture it. Astronomers worldwide are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it provides a unique opportunity to study materials from another star system. NASA has coordinated an international effort to collect data using powerful telescopes and space missions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Reached perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2025, at a distance of approximately 210 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Speed increased to around 244,000 km/h during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>Passed Earth at a safe distance of 270 million kilometers in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Will pass Jupiter at a distance of 54 million kilometers in March 2026.</li>
    <li>Estimated age of 3I/ATLAS is between 7 and 14 billion years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The following key events have marked the path of comet 3I/ATLAS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>July 1, 2025: 3I/ATLAS discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>October 29, 2025: Comet reaches perihelion, closest approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>December 2025: Comet passes Earth at a safe distance.</li>
    <li>March 2026: Planned pass by Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is definitive proof of its extrasolar origin,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This is a rare opportunity for scientists to study matter from another star system.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is unique due to its unusual chemical composition, which is rich in carbon dioxide and lacks a prominent cometary tail. These characteristics differentiate it from previously studied comets and raise questions about its origin. The comet is believed to have been ejected from its home star system billions of years ago.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and international observatories will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS until the end of January 2026, when it is expected to become too faint for most ground-based telescopes. The upcoming pass by Jupiter will provide additional data on its trajectory and gravitational interactions.</p>
