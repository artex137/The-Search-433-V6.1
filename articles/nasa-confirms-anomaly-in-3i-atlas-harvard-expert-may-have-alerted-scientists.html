      <h2>NASA Confirms Anomaly in 3I/Atlas; Harvard Expert May Have Alerted Scientists</h2>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed an anomaly regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, according to Republican legislator Anna Paulina Luna on November 12, 2025. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it raises questions about the comet's origins and characteristics. Luna stated that NASA plans to release new images and data about 3I/ATLAS once the federal government reopens after the current shutdown. Avi Loeb, a Harvard University astronomer, claims that this confirmation supports his hypotheses regarding the comet's possible non-human origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be the size of Manhattan.</li>
  <li>New images taken on November 5, 2025, by the R. Naves Observatory in Spain show the object lacks a visible tail.</li>
  <li>Avi Loeb has noted the comet's orbit aligns closely with the ecliptic plane, with a deviation of just five degrees.</li>
  <li>Loeb claims the probability of this orbital alignment occurring by chance is one in 500.</li>
  <li>The comet's composition reportedly includes nickel and very little iron, resembling aerospace industry alloys.</li>
  <li>Loeb's theories have gained public attention, including interest from celebrities like Kim Kardashian.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 5, 2025, new images of 3I/ATLAS were captured by the R. Naves Observatory, revealing the absence of a tail. This prompted discussions within the scientific community about the comet's true nature.</p>

<p>On November 12, 2025, Anna Paulina Luna announced that NASA had confirmed the anomalies noted by Loeb and indicated plans to release further data once the federal government reopens. Loeb's interpretations of the comet's characteristics have attracted significant media attention and public interest.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “Just had a good conversation with @NASA about 3I/ATLAS. As soon as the government reopens, they’ll be releasing images/data. Unfortunately, due to bureaucratic reasons, they cannot until then,” said Anna Paulina Luna.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “Dr. Avi Loeb was right in his initial analysis of the anomalous tail. NASA has also noticed it,” Luna added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “This is a sign that something doesn't add up,” Loeb warned regarding the comet's glow extending toward the Sun.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb is known for his controversial theories, particularly regarding the interstellar object 'Oumuamua in 2017. His current assertions about 3I/ATLAS have sparked renewed debate about the existence of non-human technology in space. Loeb has expressed frustrations about the skepticism he faces from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to release new images and data about 3I/ATLAS once the federal government reopens. Further investigations into the comet's characteristics and origins may follow based on the upcoming findings.</p>
