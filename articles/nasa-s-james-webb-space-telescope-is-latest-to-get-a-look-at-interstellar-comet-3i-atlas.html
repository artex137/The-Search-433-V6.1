      <h2>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is latest to get a look at interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A comet known as 3I/ATLAS has been observed by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and the SPHEREx observatory, marking its status as the third object confirmed to have originated outside Earth's solar system. The observations occurred after the comet was first detected by the Hubble Space Telescope in July 2025. The comet, which poses no threat to Earth, continues to intrigue scientists and space agencies worldwide.</p>

<p>NASA and other space agencies are conducting detailed observations of 3I/ATLAS to better understand its composition and origins. This comet, estimated to be over 12 miles wide, is moving at approximately 130,000 miles per hour and will come within about 130 million miles of Earth on October 30, according to NASA.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object observed in Earth's vicinity.</li>
    <li>Initial detection occurred in July 2025 by a telescope in Chile, part of the NASA-funded ATLAS program.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope first imaged the comet, determining its nucleus size between 1,000 feet and 3.5 miles wide.</li>
    <li>James Webb Space Telescope observed the comet on August 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx telescope conducted observations from August 7 to August 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass approximately 130 million miles from Earth on October 30, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, a telescope in Chile detected 3I/ATLAS, initially mistaking it for an asteroid. The observation was reported to the Minor Planet Center. Follow-up observations confirmed its interstellar origins, leading to its designation as 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured detailed images of the comet, allowing scientists to estimate its size. On August 6, 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope observed 3I/ATLAS in near-infrared light, followed by SPHEREx from August 7 to August 15, 2025, to gather more data on its physical properties and chemical makeup.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The scientific community is intrigued by 3I/ATLAS, and we aim to understand more about its origin and composition,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system, following the detection of 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov. These observations have spurred interest in studying objects from outside our solar system to learn more about the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze data from the James Webb and SPHEREx telescopes to gain further insights into 3I/ATLAS's properties and origins as it approaches Earth later this month.</p>
