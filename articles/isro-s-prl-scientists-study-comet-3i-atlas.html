      <h2>ISRO’s PRL scientists study comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>BENGALURU: The Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO’s) Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) scientists have studied the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas on Wednesday as it travels through the inner Solar System towards the Sun. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it provides new insights into the comet's structure and activity. The observations were conducted using PRL’s 1.2m telescope, and findings include details about the comet's tail and overall composition. Authorities plan to continue monitoring the comet as it moves through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is currently on its way out of the inner Solar System after its perihelion passage.</li>
    <li>The observations were made using a 1.2m telescope at PRL in Bengaluru.</li>
    <li>Prominent emission features identified include the CN, C2, and C3 bands.</li>
    <li>The production rate of gas from the comet's nucleus is estimated around 10<sup>25</sup> molecules/second.</li>
    <li>The dust tail is expected to point away from the Sun, while the ion tail may be visible in wide field multi-band images.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, PRL scientists conducted observations of the comet 3I/Atlas. They captured images and spectra of the comet before morning twilight. The observations revealed a near-circular coma and provided insights into the comet's activity level.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The coma is the large, glowing atmosphere of gas and dust that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the Sun,” researchers explained. “The production rate varies throughout the comet’s orbit and is driven by factors like distance from the sun and the comet’s internal composition.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is one of the many comets observed by scientists to better understand the dynamics of celestial bodies in the Solar System. Previous studies have shown how comets can provide valuable data about the early solar system and the formation of planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ISRO’s PRL scientists will continue to monitor the comet's activity as it travels further from the Sun, gathering more data to enhance understanding of its behavior and composition.</p>
