      <h2>ISS Broadcast Cut Fuels Online Claims of UFO Flyby, Analysts Cite Routine Signal Loss</h2>

<p>A NASA livestream from the International Space Station (ISS) has sparked speculation about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) after viewers observed bright lights moving beneath the camera moments before the feed switched angles and briefly cut out. The incident occurred at approximately 11:04 a.m. U.S. Central Time while the ISS was flying over Australia.</p>

<p>This situation has raised questions about the nature of the lights captured in the footage and the reasons for the broadcast interruption. While some social media users have suggested that NASA intentionally cut the feed to hide evidence of UFOs, space analysts have pointed to routine signal loss as the likely explanation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The livestream incident occurred at approximately 11:04 a.m. U.S. Central Time.</li>
    <li>The ISS was flying over Australia during the broadcast.</li>
    <li>Bright lights were observed moving beneath the ISS camera.</li>
    <li>The feed was interrupted shortly after the lights appeared.</li>
    <li>The video has been widely circulated on social media platforms, including X and Reddit.</li>
    <li>NASA has not issued a formal statement regarding the incident.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the morning of the incident, viewers noticed clusters of bright lights beneath the ISS camera while the station was over Australia. The lights were seen gliding steadily across the frame before the feed switched to a signal-loss screen. The clip was shared widely online, leading to claims of a potential UFO sighting.</p>

<p>As discussions progressed on Reddit's r/UFOs community, users began to offer alternative explanations. They pointed out that the ISS was flying over a region known for city lights and bushfires. Observers noted that the camera's brightness settings may have amplified smaller light sources, creating the illusion of movement. The feed's interruption occurred nearly a minute after the lights left the frame, aligning with known communication handovers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“ISS livestream disruptions occur during satellite transitions and do not indicate intentional concealment,” said a NASA representative in past advisories.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader trend of increased public interest in UFOs, particularly with the rise of social media platforms where users share and discuss such sightings. NASA has previously clarified that the ISS often captures moving ground illumination and atmospheric reflections, which can appear unusual when viewed without context.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to continue monitoring ISS livestreams and may provide further clarification regarding the incident if necessary. Analysts anticipate that discussions about the footage will persist online as users explore various interpretations of the lights observed during the broadcast.</p>
