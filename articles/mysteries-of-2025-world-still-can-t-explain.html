      <h2>Mysteries of 2025 World Still Can't Explain</h2>

<p>The world has entered 2026, but several mysteries from 2025, including the nature of comet 3I/ATLAS, remain unsolved. Reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and other strange occurrences have continued to intrigue scientists and the public alike.</p>

<p>Authorities and researchers are still investigating these phenomena, as interest in the mysteries persists. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken steps to manage drone activity in response to the UAP sightings, while scientists are examining the implications of the discoveries related to the comet and ancient structures in Egypt.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reports of UAP sightings began in November 2024.</li>
    <li>The FAA temporarily banned flying drones in certain regions due to the sightings.</li>
    <li>A Buga sphere was discovered in Colombia after the U.S. drone crisis.</li>
    <li>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was confirmed by NASA and is expected to leave the solar system by 2030.</li>
    <li>A vast city was discovered beneath the pyramids of Giza in March 2025, stretching 1,200 metres.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2024, the first reports of UAP sightings surfaced, leading to increased public interest and concern. The FAA responded by temporarily banning drone flights in affected regions. In March 2025, researchers announced the discovery of a vast city beneath the pyramids of Giza, claiming it to be significantly larger than the pyramids themselves. By July 2025, scientists had identified comet 3I/ATLAS, which has since passed Earth and is expected to exit the solar system by 2030.</p>

<blockquote>“The presence of ancient symbols and the energy emitted by the discovered Buga sphere have raised many questions,” experts stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Unexplained aerial phenomena have drawn attention globally, with UAP sightings prompting a response from aviation authorities. The discovery of ancient structures, such as the city beneath the Giza pyramids, has sparked debate among scientists regarding the historical significance and authenticity of such claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the UAP sightings and the Buga sphere are ongoing. Researchers continue to study the comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, while discussions surrounding the significance of the discoveries in Egypt are expected to evolve as more evidence comes to light.</p>
