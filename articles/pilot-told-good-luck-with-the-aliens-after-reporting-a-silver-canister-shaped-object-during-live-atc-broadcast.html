      <h2>Pilot told 'good luck with the aliens' after reporting a silver canister-shaped object during live ATC broadcast</h2>

<p>A private jet pilot reported a small, silver cylinder hovering near his wing at approximately 3,500 feet over Rhode Island on December 19, 2025. The incident, captured on live air traffic control (ATC) broadcast, has raised interest in unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>The sighting has prompted discussions among aviation experts and enthusiasts regarding the nature of the object. No official reports from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have been released, which is typical for unexplained sightings unless they pose a direct hazard. The video of the incident has gained traction on social media, sparking various theories about the object's identity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Above Rhode Island</li>
    <li>Aircraft type: Piper PA-32RT-300T Turbo Lance II</li>
    <li>Altitude: Approximately 3,500 feet</li>
    <li>Video views: Over 14,000 on YouTube</li>
    <li>Reported by: Private jet pilot</li>
    <li>ATC response: No other reports in the area</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2025, a pilot flying a Piper PA-32RT-300T Turbo Lance II reported seeing a small, silver cylinder hovering near his aircraft. The pilot communicated with ATC, noting that the object appeared to be stationary. ATC inquired if the object could be a drone or a balloon. The pilot described the sighting as "astonishing" and noted that the object had no visible attachments.</p>

<p>Other pilots in the region reacted over the radio, with one expressing support for the pilot's claim. ATC humorously remarked, "Good luck with the aliens." The incident has since gained attention online, with the video being shared widely.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It appears to be standing still,” the pilot told ATC during the sighting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Good luck with the aliens,” ATC responded jokingly.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a recent report by Major Ryan Bodenheimer, a retired US fighter pilot, who described a close encounter with a rectangular-shaped UFO that defied conventional aeronautical laws. Bodenheimer's experience, which involved an object coming within close proximity to his aircraft, has added to the ongoing discourse surrounding unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Experts have suggested various explanations for the Rhode Island sighting, including the possibility of a weather balloon or military testing. Mick West, a science writer, indicated that a weather balloon is the most plausible explanation for the object's appearance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for further investigation into the incident. The lack of an official FAA or NTSB report means that the case may not receive additional scrutiny unless new information emerges.</p>
