      <h2>New study backs up famous 'flying saucer' sightings over Washington DC in the 1950s</h2>

<p>Scientists have discovered evidence of potential UFOs in a study analyzing 1950s photographs taken at California's Palomar Observatory. The research, which includes images from 1951 to 1957, has identified mysterious flashes of light that appeared in the night sky, coinciding with notable sightings over Washington DC on July 27, 1952.</p>

<p>This study is significant as it may provide further insight into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) during a time when space exploration was just beginning. The research is part of the VASCO project, led by Beatriz Villarroel of Nordita at Stockholm University. The findings suggest that some of the observed flashes could be sunlight reflecting off flat, shiny objects high above Earth, predating the launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study analyzed over 100,000 photographic plates from Palomar Observatory.</li>
    <li>Research period: 1951–1957.</li>
    <li>Notable sighting date: July 27, 1952, over Washington DC.</li>
    <li>Project name: VASCO (Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations).</li>
    <li>Lead researcher: Beatriz Villarroel, Nordita, Stockholm University.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The study began with the examination of pre-Space Age photographs taken at Palomar Observatory. Researchers filtered through more than 100,000 candidates to identify 'transients'—points of light that appeared only once.</p>

<p>On July 27, 1952, a cluster of UFO sightings over Washington DC coincided with one of the identified flashes in the study. The researchers noted that the pattern of the flashes corresponds to flat, highly reflective objects in high orbit, rather than typical meteors or dust.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The plates were created before Sputnik in 1957, so if these were glints from orbit, they weren't from man-made satellites,” said Beatriz Villarroel, emphasizing the significance of the findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This research adds to a growing body of work examining UAP sightings and their implications for understanding aerial phenomena. Historical incidents, such as the 1952 Washington DC sightings, have long captivated public interest and prompted official investigations.</p>

<p>Authorities have been increasingly open to exploring the origins of UAPs, especially following recent disclosures from military agencies regarding unidentified objects in American airspace.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue their investigation into the origins of the identified flashes and their potential implications for understanding UAPs. Further studies may involve examining additional photographic evidence from the same era.</p>
