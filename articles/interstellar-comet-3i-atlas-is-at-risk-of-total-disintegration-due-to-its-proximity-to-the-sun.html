      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS at risk of total disintegration due to proximity to the Sun</h2>

<p>Astronomers have reported that comet 3I/ATLAS, a rare visitor from another star system, is on a dangerous approach to the Sun, with concerns about its structural integrity increasing as it nears perihelion in 2026. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's trajectory.</p>

<p>Scientists worldwide are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it shows signs of instability, with intense heat and solar radiation threatening to fragment the comet. This event could transform a once-in-a-lifetime observation into a shower of cosmic debris, providing a unique opportunity to study materials from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> 2023 by the ATLAS asteroid warning system</li>
    <li><strong>Expected perihelion:</strong> 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Agencies:</strong> NASA, ESA, various observatories in Chile and Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Tools:</strong> Ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2023 and has since been tracked as it journeys through our solar system. Observations indicate a significant increase in gas and dust release from its core, known as sublimation, as it approaches the Sun. Worrying signs include erratic outgassing and potential cracks forming in its structure, raising concerns about its ability to withstand the extreme conditions at perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If the core breaks, 3I/ATLAS will cease to exist as a single object, turning into a swarm of smaller chunks of ice and rock,” said an unnamed astronomer involved in the monitoring efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar comet, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its external origin makes its chemical composition particularly interesting, serving as a time capsule that could reveal information about planetary formation in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Monitoring of 3I/ATLAS will continue as scientists gather data to understand its behavior and structure. Observations aim to ensure that any fragments do not pose a threat to Earth while providing insights into the comet's composition and the conditions of its origin.</p>
