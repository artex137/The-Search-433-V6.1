      <h2>Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist, says massive interstellar object plowing through space toward Mars</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has confirmed that astronomers have been tracking a fast-moving interstellar object, known as 3I/ATLAS, for over two months as it hurtles toward Mars. The object, which is generally considered a comet, may be far more massive than previously thought, with estimates suggesting it could weigh at least 33 billion tons.</p>

<p>This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of interstellar objects. Loeb indicated that NASA’s HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will likely be used to study 3I/ATLAS. Observations may help refine size estimates and determine the object's composition, which could indicate whether it is an unusually massive comet or potentially a piece of alien technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: at least 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Size estimate: nucleus larger than 3.1 miles across</li>
    <li>Expected to pass inside Mars’ orbit: by the end of October</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: at least 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Observation blackout: late October through early December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers have tracked 3I/ATLAS for over two months as it approaches Mars. The object is expected to pass just inside Mars’ orbit by the end of October. However, it will be too close to the Sun for observations from late October through early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "We may be looking at an unusually massive comet with an unusual chemical composition on an unusually rare trajectory or alien technology."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is considered a significant discovery, as it may be three to five orders of magnitude more massive than previous interstellar objects detected, including 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unusual trajectory indicates that it originates from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to use the HiRISE camera to study 3I/ATLAS, which may provide further insights into the object's size and composition once observations resume after the blackout period in December 2025.</p>
