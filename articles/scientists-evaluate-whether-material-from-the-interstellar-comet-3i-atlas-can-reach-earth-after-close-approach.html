      <h2>Scientists evaluate whether material from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS can reach Earth after close approach</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its closest distance to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 269 million kilometers. Discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, the comet follows a hyperbolic trajectory that poses no risk of collision with our planet. Observations have revealed that the comet lost significant mass during its perihelion in October 2025.</p>

<p>This evaluation matters as scientists seek to understand the composition and origin of 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed object from outside the Solar System. Authorities, including astronomers using the Hubble and James Webb telescopes, are monitoring the comet's behaviour to gather insights into materials that may have been preserved since its formation in another star system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached its minimum distance from Earth on December 19, 2025, at 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Its perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, about 203 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at speeds exceeding 137,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between 1.4 and 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate the presence of compounds such as cyanide and atomic nickel vapor.</li>
    <li>The probability of impact with Earth remains negligible, with no objects coming closer than ten Earth radii.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System at a speed exceeding 137,000 kilometers per hour. Its perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, between the orbits of Mars and Earth. Following this passage, the comet exhibited a teardrop-shaped coma and an anti-tail directed towards the Sun.</p>

<p>Observations by the Hubble telescope in November 2025 captured details of the comet's structure, including gas emissions that increased as it approached the Sun. On December 19, 2025, the comet reached its closest point to Earth, with astronomers continuing to monitor its trajectory and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The study of 3I/ATLAS represents a unique opportunity to compare interstellar materials with those from the Solar System,” said an astronomer involved in the research.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Each of these objects provides valuable data on the chemical diversity beyond the Solar System. The passage of 3I/ATLAS underlines the importance of monitoring networks like ATLAS for early detection of external visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Telescopes, both terrestrial and space-based, will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS until it becomes too faint to observe, which is predicted for mid-2026. Future observations by the Vera C. Rubin telescope aim to increase detections of interstellar objects, enhancing our understanding of their characteristics and origins.</p>
