      <h2>Obama's remarks fuel speculation about UFO disclosures</h2>
<p>Former US President Barack Obama has stated that aliens are "real," but he has not seen any evidence of extraterrestrial life, according to comments made on February 15, 2026. Obama spoke to YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen, clarifying that while he believes in the statistical possibility of alien life, he has not encountered any evidence during his presidency.</p>

<p>Obama's remarks have sparked renewed interest in UFOs and the possibility of a government disclosure of classified information regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. Nick Pope, a former investigator for the British Ministry of Defence, has noted that many in the UFO community view Obama's comments as a quasi-official confirmation of extraterrestrial existence. Pope indicated that there are rumors of an upcoming "disclosure" event where long-held secrets may be revealed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Obama made comments about aliens on February 15, 2026.</li>
  <li>He spoke with Brian Tyler Cohen during a YouTube interview.</li>
  <li>A Pentagon report from 2024 found no evidence of an alien cover-up.</li>
  <li>Nick Pope has suggested Obama's comments may indicate a forthcoming disclosure.</li>
  <li>Current US President Donald Trump has stated he does not believe in aliens.</li>
  <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has emphasized the scientific nature of the search for extraterrestrial life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 15, 2026, Obama discussed the possibility of aliens in an interview with Brian Tyler Cohen. He stated that while he believes in the existence of extraterrestrial life, he has not personally witnessed any evidence. Following his remarks, speculation grew around the potential for a government disclosure regarding UFOs.</p>
<p>In 2024, a Pentagon report was released, which concluded that there was no evidence to support claims of an alien cover-up. However, it noted that public belief in such conspiracies is likely to continue.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Much of the UFO community has taken this as quasi-official confirmation of an extraterrestrial reality,” said Nick Pope. “Obama’s comments are being seen as part of an acclimatisation campaign, readying people ahead of a definitive, formal announcement.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That’s why there may be genuinely historic developments ahead from the current administration,” said filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee, referencing the potential for future disclosures.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Obama has previously spoken about UFOs, and his recent comments have reignited discussions about government transparency regarding extraterrestrial life. Reports of unidentified aerial phenomena have increased in recent years, and testimonies from former intelligence officials have fueled speculation about what the government may know.</p>
<p>UFO enthusiasts have long focused on Area 51, a top-secret facility in Nevada, as a potential site for alien research. Historical accounts of sightings and encounters have added to the public's interest in the topic.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Speculation continues about the possibility of an official government disclosure regarding UFOs. Reports suggest that President Trump may be preparing a speech on the subject, potentially scheduled for July 8, 2026. The scientific community also remains engaged in the search for extraterrestrial life, with ongoing research into interstellar visitors.</p>
