      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Planetary Scientists Are 'Super Excited' As NASA Confirms It Poses 'No Threat' to Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, following its closest approach to the Sun on Wednesday and Thursday. The comet, which originated outside our solar system, has captured the interest of planetary scientists and the public alike, marking a significant moment in astronomical studies.</p>

<p>The confirmation from NASA, shared via its Solar System website, reassures the public that Comet 3I/ATLAS will remain far from Earth. This interstellar comet provides a unique opportunity for researchers to study materials that developed in a different star system, enhancing our understanding of comets beyond our own solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed its perihelion on Wednesday and Thursday.</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed the comet poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>It is only the third interstellar comet ever observed.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be visible from Earth using ground-based telescopes until September 2025.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency (ESA) photographed the comet on October 7, capturing its coma.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb estimates a 40% chance that 3I/ATLAS is not a natural comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion between Wednesday and Thursday this week, drawing attention from scientists worldwide. NASA confirmed its safety shortly after the comet's closest approach, emphasizing that it poses no danger to Earth.</p>
<p>As of October 7, the ESA successfully captured images of 3I/ATLAS, showcasing its brilliant coma as it passed near Mars. The comet will remain obscured by the Sun's brightness for the time being, complicating visibility from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away," NASA stated on its Solar System website.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "This is only the third such interstellar comet we've ever been able to study, and planetary scientists are super excited to learn about what comets in other solar systems are like," said Jason Wright, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks only the third instance of an interstellar comet being studied by scientists. Previous interstellar objects have generated considerable interest, leading to ongoing research into their origins and characteristics.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb's hypothesis about the comet's potential artificial nature adds a layer of intrigue, although NASA maintains that the comet poses no threat. The scientific community continues to explore the implications of studying such unique celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study Comet 3I/ATLAS until it becomes obscured by the Sun, with visibility expected to resume in December 2025. NASA and other space agencies remain focused on gathering data to understand more about this unique interstellar visitor.</p>
