      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Oldest Comet Visitor from Solar System?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is an interstellar comet that was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Scientists believe the comet could be at least 7 billion years old, potentially making it older than the solar system itself.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may provide insights into the early universe and the composition of interstellar objects. Authorities are currently monitoring the comet's trajectory and observing its chemical changes as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is estimated to be at least 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>The comet is the third confirmed interstellar object detected.</li>
    <li>122 observations have been collected from 31 observatories.</li>
    <li>Pre-discovery observations date back to June 14, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will be visible again to telescopes on Earth in December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025, during a survey by the ATLAS telescope. Observations prior to the discovery have been traced back to June 14, 2025, using data from multiple ATLAS telescopes and the Zwicky Transient Facility.</p>
<p>The comet's trajectory has been confirmed as unbound and hyperbolic, solidifying its status as an interstellar object. As it approaches the Sun, it has begun to exhibit changes in color due to chemical reactions in its coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS stands out as a remarkable interstellar visitor, possibly the oldest comet ever observed,” said a spokesperson for the NASA-funded ATLAS project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows in the footsteps of previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have also provided valuable data about the cosmos. The study of such comets is crucial for understanding the materials and conditions that existed in the early universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are preparing to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS using the James Webb Space Telescope in December 2025, after its perihelion, to gather further data on its composition and behavior as it moves through space.</p>
