      <h2>Newly Released November 6 Image Deepens the Mystery Around Interstellar Visitor 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A newly released image of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, captured on November 6 by the Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph aboard Europa Clipper, raises further questions about the comet's characteristics and behavior. The image, taken at a distance of approximately 164 million kilometers as the object passed through the inner solar system, shows a blurred, low-contrast smear with a brighter ultraviolet concentration.</p>

<p>This image is significant as it is one of the most recent representations of 3I/ATLAS available on NASA's website, amidst a lack of new updates regarding the object. The peculiarities of the image suggest that 3I/ATLAS may be challenging conventional comet models, and the absence of high-quality data raises concerns about transparency from NASA.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: November 6</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 164 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Instrument used: Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph aboard Europa Clipper</li>
    <li>Image characteristics: Blurred, low-contrast smear with a brighter ultraviolet concentration</li>
    <li>NASA's statement: Data will help determine the composition and distribution of elements in the comet's coma</li>
    <li>Number of interstellar objects observed: 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 6, the Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph captured an image of 3I/ATLAS as it traveled through the inner solar system. The image was later released on NASA's website, highlighting the unusual characteristics of the comet. Previously, scientists had noted anomalies in 3I/ATLAS's behavior, such as non-gravitational acceleration and pulsating jets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Captured over a period of seven hours, the data gathered by the Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph instrument will help scientists determine the composition and distribution of elements in the comet’s coma.” — NASA/JPL-Caltech/SWRI</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system. Its trajectory indicates that it will not return, making each observation crucial. Prior observations have shown anomalous features, which have led scientists to call for high-quality data to better understand its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to analyze the data gathered by the Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph to provide insights into the composition of 3I/ATLAS. However, the lack of high-resolution follow-up imagery and detailed spectral results may hinder further investigation into the object’s unusual characteristics.</p>
