      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS detected emitting radio signal, but not from aliens</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is emitting a detectable radio signal, but authorities have clarified that the emission is consistent with natural cometary processes and not evidence of alien technology. The comet was first observed on 1st July 2025 by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and is only the third known object to enter the solar system from interstellar space.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it contributes to the understanding of interstellar objects and their behaviour. The MeerKAT radio telescope array in South Africa detected the radio signals as the comet approached its closest point to the Sun in late October. Researchers have noted that the radio emissions provide valuable information about the comet’s composition and activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date Observed:</strong> 1st July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Location:</strong> MeerKAT radio telescope array, South Africa</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> Late October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Radio Emission Source:</strong> Hydroxyl (OH) molecules</li>
    <li><strong>Number of Known Interstellar Objects:</strong> Three</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1st July 2025, NASA’s ATLAS first observed comet 3I/ATLAS. As the comet approached the Sun in late October, astronomers at the MeerKAT radio telescope array detected a distinctive radio signal associated with the comet. The findings were released shortly thereafter, clarifying that the emissions were linked to natural processes rather than artificial communication.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Reports that 3I/ATLAS was ‘broadcasting’ radio signals are misleading. The observed emissions are typical for comets and do not indicate an artificial source,” said a spokesperson for the research team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of hydroxyl signatures around 3I/ATLAS reinforces the conclusion that it behaves like a conventional comet. Previous interstellar visitors, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, exhibited different trajectories, and the unique path of 3I/ATLAS suggests it may originate from a less-explored region of the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency are collecting imagery and spectral measurements of 3I/ATLAS. Detailed analysis is expected in 2026, as scientists continue to explore the comet's origins and characteristics.</p>
