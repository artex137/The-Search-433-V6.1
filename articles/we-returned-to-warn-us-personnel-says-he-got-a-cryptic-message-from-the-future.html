      <h2>'WE RETURNED TO WARN...': US personnel says he got a cryptic message from the future</h2>

<p>A UFO landed in Rendlesham Forest, England, in December 1980, transmitting a coded message to a US Army sergeant stationed at the nearby air base. Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston claims he received a mental transmission of binary code after witnessing the UFO land. The message, decoded from a series of ones and zeros, contains warnings about humanity's future.</p>

<p>This incident, often referred to as "Britain's Roswell," has drawn renewed interest due to the cryptic nature of the message. Authorities and researchers are examining the implications of the claims made by Penniston and the historical context of the event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in December 1980 in Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, England.</li>
    <li>Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston reported seeing a UFO that was approximately 2.7 metres tall and wide.</li>
    <li>Penniston recorded a binary message over 16 pages, containing warnings about humanity's future.</li>
    <li>RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge were the two air bases used by the US Air Force during the Cold War.</li>
    <li>The decoded message included phrases like "EXPLORATION [OF] HUMANITY CONTINUOUS BEYOND 8100" and "ADVANCE OR PERISH THE CHOICE IS NOW."</li>
    <li>RAF Bentwaters is believed to have housed tactical nuclear weapons during the Cold War.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 1980, US Air Force personnel reported seeing strange lights in Rendlesham Forest. This led to various sightings and official recordings documenting the event. Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston later described walking up to a UFO that landed in the woods. After the incident, he claimed to have received a stream of binary code, which he decoded into a cryptic message warning of humanity's future.</p>

<p>The message included geographic coordinates pointing to ancient sites worldwide, suggesting a possible connection to human history rather than extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fabric of the shell was more like a smooth, opaque, black glass,” Penniston said, describing the UFO. “It stood on fixed legs.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We returned to warn from where you will be if you choose the path or origin year 8100,” the decoded message stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Rendlesham Forest incident is one of the most documented UFO sightings in history, with numerous military personnel involved. The event has been the subject of various interpretations over the years, with some suggesting that the messages may originate from humans in a distant future rather than from extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<p>Interest in UFO phenomena has increased in recent years, leading to government investigations and public discussions about the implications of such encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the Rendlesham Forest incident continue as researchers analyze the historical context and implications of the claims made by Penniston. Further discussions about the nature of the message may arise, as well as potential inquiries into related phenomena.</p>
