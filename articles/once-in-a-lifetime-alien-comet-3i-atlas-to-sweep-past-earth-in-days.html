      <h2>Once-in-a-lifetime 'alien' comet 3I/ATLAS to sweep past Earth in DAYS</h2>

<p>A rare comet known as 3I/ATLAS is set to pass by Earth in two days, marking its closest approach at approximately 168 million miles away. This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet recorded to travel through our solar system, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>The upcoming flyby has generated considerable interest among astronomers and the public. NASA has confirmed that there is no danger to Earth from the comet. However, observers will need a telescope to view it, as it will not be visible to the naked eye.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest approach on <strong>Friday</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet will be about <strong>168 million miles</strong> from Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be over <strong>8 billion years old</strong>.</li>
    <li>It was discovered within the orbit of Jupiter, traveling at approximately <strong>137,000 miles per hour</strong>.</li>
    <li>At perihelion, its speed increased to <strong>153,000 miles per hour (246,000 kilometers per hour)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered within the orbit of Jupiter, where it was initially traveling at 137,000 miles per hour. As it approached the Sun, its speed increased to 153,000 miles per hour. The comet is now moving away from the Sun, with its speed gradually decreasing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa has stated, "When it was discovered within the orbit of Jupiter, the interstellar comet was traveling about 137,000 miles per hour. Pulled by the Sun’s gravity, its speed increased as expected, reaching 153,000 miles per hour at perihelion."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant not only because of its rarity but also due to its age. At over 8 billion years old, it predates our solar system, which is about 4.6 billion years old. This makes it the oldest known object observed in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, 3I/ATLAS will continue its trajectory out of the solar system, and it will not return. Observers are encouraged to use telescopes to catch a glimpse of this historic comet before it departs.</p>
