      <h2>Latest on Comet 3I/ATLAS: Where is it headed, and what to expect next?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently travelling through the solar system after crossing Mars on October 3, 2023, and is now approaching the Sun, where it will reach perihelion on October 29. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's trajectory.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it is only the third interstellar object detected in the solar system. The European Space Agency (ESA) has been actively monitoring 3I/ATLAS and released images captured by the ExoMars orbiter. Scientists are exploring various possibilities regarding the nature of the object, including theories proposed by Harvard scientist Avi Loeb. Authorities are focused on gathering more data as 3I/ATLAS continues its journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Crossed Mars:</strong> October 3, 2023, at approximately 30 million kilometres from the planet</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> Early December 2023, at 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Next ESA Observation:</strong> November 2023, using the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE)</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Data Availability:</strong> February 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Currently poses no threat to Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, and has since intrigued scientists due to its interstellar origin. It crossed Mars on October 3, 2023, allowing for closer observation. The ESA released images from the ExoMars orbiter, showing a bright coma but no tail. The comet is now on a trajectory towards the Sun, with perihelion expected on October 29, 2023.</p>

<p>Following its perihelion, 3I/ATLAS will become less visible and is expected to reappear to observers on Earth in early December 2023, when it will be at its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, has urged the scientific community to consider the anomalies presented by 3I/ATLAS. He stated, “What if it is a piece of alien technology?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also mentioned, “If it is not a natural object, 3I/ATLAS could release mini probes which will then seed into the planets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. Its approach has sparked discussions within the scientific community about the potential implications of such objects, including the possibilities of advanced technology or extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. The ESA's JUICE mission will focus on the comet in November 2023, with detailed observations expected to be available by February 2026. Current assessments indicate that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>
