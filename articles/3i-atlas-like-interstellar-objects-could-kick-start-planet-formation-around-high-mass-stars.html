      <h2>3I/ATLAS-Like Interstellar Objects Could Kick Start Planet Formation around High-Mass Stars</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has discovered that interstellar objects, including comet 3I/ATLAS, can facilitate the formation of giant exoplanets around high-mass stars, according to research presented by Professor Susanne Pfalzner at the EPSC-DPS2025 Joint Meeting in Helsinki, Finland, in September 2025.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it suggests that interstellar objects could solve a long-standing issue in planetary formation theories. The presence of these objects in protoplanetary disks may allow for the rapid formation of gas giants within the limited lifetime of these disks, which is typically about two million years.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interstellar objects include 1I/’Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was observed using the CaSSIS instrument aboard ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Professor Susanne Pfalzner is affiliated with Forschungszentrum Jülich.</li>
    <li>Gas giant planets are rare around M dwarfs but common around higher-mass stars.</li>
    <li>Planet-forming disks around Sun-like stars dissipate in about two million years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since 2017, astronomers have identified three interstellar objects passing through the Solar System:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1I/’Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object, was detected in 2017.</li>
    <li>2I/Borisov followed in 2019.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was noted most recently, with observations made in October 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects may be able to jump start planet formation, in particular around higher-mass stars,” said Professor Pfalzner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Higher-mass stars are more efficient in capturing interstellar objects in their disks,” she added. “Therefore, interstellar object-seeded planet formation should be more efficient around these stars, providing a fast way to form giant planets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The research addresses a key challenge in planetary formation: the difficulty of forming objects larger than one meter through traditional accretion processes. Current models suggest that larger bodies tend to bounce off or shatter when colliding. The introduction of interstellar objects as seeds for planet formation may provide a solution, allowing for more efficient growth within protoplanetary disks.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further studies will explore the implications of interstellar objects on the dynamics of planet formation, particularly around high-mass stars. The research team will continue to analyze data from observed interstellar objects to refine their models.</p>
