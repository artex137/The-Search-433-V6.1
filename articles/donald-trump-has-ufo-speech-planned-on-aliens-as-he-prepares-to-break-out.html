    <li>Interview platform: New York Post's Pod Force One</li>
    <li>Date of Lara Trump's remarks: not disclosed</li>
    <li>White House press secretary: Karoline Leavitt</li>
    <li>Former President Barack Obama's comments on extraterrestrial life: February 15, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 19, 2023, Lara Trump discussed her father-in-law's potential speech on UFOs during a podcast. She indicated that Trump has been coy about the subject when asked. The White House was contacted for verification of the speech, with Leavitt expressing curiosity about the matter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "We've kind of asked my father-in-law about this. We all want to know about the UFOs... and he played a little coy with us." 
    <strong>- Lara Trump</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "I'll have to check in with our speech writing team... that would be of great interest to me personally." 
    <strong>- Karoline Leavitt</strong>
