      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Approaches Mars at High Speed</h2>
<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, traveling at a speed of 137,000 miles per hour. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>This event is significant for astronomers as it offers a chance to study 3I/ATLAS up close. Various spacecraft orbiting Mars have captured images of the comet, which is currently invisible to telescopes on Earth. The European Space Agency (ESA) is among the organizations monitoring the comet closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: October 3, 2023</li>
    <li>Speed of 3I/ATLAS: 137,000 miles per hour (approximately 60 km/s)</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars at closest approach: 30 million km</li>
    <li>Observation period by ESA: October 1 to 7, 2023</li>
    <li>Next major observation by Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer: November 2 to 25, 2023</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is also set to observe the comet</li>
    <li>Potential delays in image releases due to U.S. government shutdown</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 1, 2023, ESA's Mars orbiters began tracking 3I/ATLAS as it approached Mars. On October 2, NASA's Perseverance rover captured images that some believe show the comet. The closest approach occurred on October 3. ESA's observation period continues until October 7, 2023.</p>
<p>Following the closest approach, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer will observe 3I/ATLAS from November 2 to 25, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I think Perseverance may have spotted interstellar comet 3I/Atlas last night from Mars!” said astrophotographer Simeon Schmauß, who analyzed images from the rover.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Is this 3I/ATLAS?! I created a time-lapse using 9 minutes of images captured by Mars Perseverance on October 2nd, and we clearly observe something traveling very fast across the night sky,” said Stefan Burns, a user on X.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is a rare interstellar comet that has captured global attention. Previous observations of such objects have provided insights into the formation of the Solar System. The ongoing interest in 3I/ATLAS highlights the importance of advanced space missions in studying celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Image releases from NASA’s Mars missions may face delays due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.</p>
