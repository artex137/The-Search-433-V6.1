      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on December 19, 2025</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest proximity to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing at a safe distance of approximately 270 million kilometers, or 1.8 astronomical units. There are no injuries or fatalities reported, as the comet poses no threat of impact.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers, as it provides an opportunity for detailed studies of the composition of interstellar objects. Various space agencies have been monitoring 3I/ATLAS since its discovery in July 2025, and the approach allows for enhanced observations and data collection.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed: exceeds 200,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile</li>
    <li>Previous perihelion: October 2025</li>
    <li>Next encounter: Jupiter in 2026</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter: between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile. Initial observations indicated a weak magnitude, but subsequent analyses confirmed cometary activity, revealing a diffuse coma and tail. The comet passed through perihelion in October 2025, exhibiting significant activity.</p>
<p>In November 2025, space telescopes captured images of the comet from a distance of approximately 286 million kilometers from Earth. Observations showed an increase in brightness and the evolution of the coma, which is characterized by a reddish color.</p>
<p>After its closest approach to Earth on December 19, the comet will head toward an encounter with Jupiter in 2026, where gravitational interactions will slightly alter its trajectory before its definitive ejection into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The approach of 3I/ATLAS represents a valuable opportunity for the astronomical community to study the composition of an object from outside our solar system,” said an astronomer involved in the monitoring efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Its hyperbolic trajectory and high speed confirm that it is not gravitationally bound to the solar system. The comet's unique characteristics have sparked interest among astronomers, particularly regarding its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the December 19 approach, astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze data collected from various instruments. Observations will help refine orbital models and enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
