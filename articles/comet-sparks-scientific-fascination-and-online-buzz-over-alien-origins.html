      <h2>Comet sparks scientific fascination and online buzz over "alien" origins</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently traveling through our solar system, captivating scientists and internet users alike, including celebrity Kim Kardashian, who has sought answers from NASA. The comet has prompted discussions about its origins, with speculation about it being an alien spacecraft arising from various sources, including a member of Congress and a Harvard researcher.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention due to the comet's unique characteristics as only the third interstellar object detected passing through our solar system. NASA has responded to the speculation by releasing new images of the comet and emphasizing that it is a normal cosmic object. Thomas Puzia, an astrophysicist involved in its discovery, has warned against prioritizing speculation over scientific evidence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Third interstellar object ever discovered in our solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA released new images on Wednesday, October 17, 2023.</li>
    <li>Thomas Puzia led the discovery team at a Chilean observatory.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, Harvard Professor, has been vocal about the possibility of technological origins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers detected Comet 3I/ATLAS, marking its entry into our solar system. Speculation about its nature began shortly after, with discussions fueled by various public figures, including Kim Kardashian. On October 17, 2023, NASA released new images of the comet, aiming to clarify its identity amidst growing speculation.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches Earth, scientists have begun to study its characteristics closely. Puzia has noted that this comet offers insights into extrasolar systems that may be billions of years older than our own.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It’s amazing to see how people are really engaged in the discussion,” said Thomas Puzia, astrophysicist. “But it’s very dangerous and to a certain degree misleading to put speculations ahead of scientific process.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We want very much to find signs of life in the universe... but 3I/ATLAS is a comet,” said Amit Kshatriya, a senior NASA official.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The likelihood is it came from a solar system older than our own,” said NASA scientist Tom Statler. “It’s a window into the deep past, and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our Sun.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered in our solar system, following the Oumuamua comet in 2017, which also sparked theories about potential extraterrestrial origins. Avi Loeb, a prominent figure in these discussions, has previously advocated for the consideration of technological possibilities regarding interstellar objects.</p>

<p>The scientific community remains divided, with some researchers urging caution against speculation while others advocate for open-mindedness in exploring the comet's origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists plan to conduct close observations to unravel its mysteries and understand its composition. Improved technology for observation and detection may lead to more discoveries of similar objects in the future.</p>
