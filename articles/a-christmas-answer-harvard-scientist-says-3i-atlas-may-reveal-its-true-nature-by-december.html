      <h2>A Christmas answer? Harvard scientist says 3I/ATLAS may reveal its true nature by December</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, confirming it as a comet, while Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb contends that significant questions remain and answers may emerge by Christmas. Loeb's comments follow the release of images taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on October 3, 2023, when 3I/ATLAS was approximately 30 million kilometres from Earth.</p>

<p>This debate is significant as it challenges the conventional understanding of the object. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and behaves like a typical comet. Loeb, however, argues that the recent observations suggest anomalies that cannot be easily explained and warrant further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA released images of 3I/ATLAS on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>Loeb believes key insights have emerged from amateur astronomers' observations after the object's closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb has conducted his analysis of the images and data from 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>NASA claims the object behaves like a comet, shedding gas and dust.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, NASA captured images of 3I/ATLAS using the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The images depicted the object as a “fuzzy ball of light” due to a distance of around 30 million kilometres and visible spacecraft jitter.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2023, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun, prompting amateur astronomers to photograph the object. Their long-exposure images revealed two anomalies: straight, collimated lines extending a million kilometres on either side of the object.</p>
<p>Loeb has stated that by December 19, 2025, further observations should clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS, potentially providing answers regarding its composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was not surprised. There was no big news,” Loeb stated regarding NASA's announcement. “NASA repeated the official mantra that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also remarked, “Mother Nature was kinder to NASA than expected from a random delivery of rocks by at least a factor of 100,000 based on the two anomalies.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The astronomy community widely accepts NASA's classification of 3I/ATLAS as a comet. However, Loeb’s perspective urges a reconsideration of the evidence, suggesting that anomalies may indicate alternative explanations, including the possibility of technological origins.</p>
<p>Loeb has previously highlighted the importance of examining unexplained phenomena in astronomy, advocating for a more open-minded approach to interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb has called for further observations from larger ground-based telescopes and the Hubble and Webb telescopes to analyze the jets of 3I/ATLAS. He expects results by December 19, 2025, which may clarify whether the jets arise from natural processes or technological sources.</p>
