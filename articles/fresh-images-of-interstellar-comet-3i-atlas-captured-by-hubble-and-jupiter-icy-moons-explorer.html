      <h2>Fresh Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Captured by Hubble and Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope and the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) have captured new images of Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19. This interstellar comet, discovered in July, is only the third interstellar object identified in our celestial region, generating significant interest among astronomers.</p>

<p>The observations from Hubble and Juice are crucial for understanding the comet's trajectory and composition. The data will help researchers analyze the gases sublimated during the comet's close encounter with the sun in October.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Hubble captured images of the comet on November 30, 2023, from approximately 286 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>Juice observed the comet from about 66 million kilometers away at the beginning of November 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will come within 270 million kilometers of Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Juice was launched in April 2023 to study Jupiter's moons Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa.</li>
    <li>Data from Juice is expected to be transmitted between February 18 and 20, 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. Hubble conducted its initial observations shortly after the discovery, providing details about the comet's teardrop shape. Juice launched in April 2023 and began its observations of the comet in early November 2023, while Hubble captured clearer images on November 30, 2023. The comet is projected to come closest to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The newly released image depicts a glowing coma surrounding the comet, along with two distinct tails: a plasma tail formed by electrically charged gas and a faint dust tail consisting of solid particles,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as it is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following Comet 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and Comet 2I/Borisov. Its study may provide insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are awaiting further data from the Juice mission, expected between February 18 and 20, 2024. This data will include high-resolution images and composition analyses that may deepen our understanding of Comet 3I/ATLAS's origins and characteristics.</p>
