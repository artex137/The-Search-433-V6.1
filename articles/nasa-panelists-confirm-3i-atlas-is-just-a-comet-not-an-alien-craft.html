      <h2>NASA Panelists Confirm 3I/Atlas Is Just A Comet, Not An Alien Craft</h2>

<p>NASA panelists have confirmed that Comet 3I/ATLAS, which will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, is not an alien craft, but rather a comet originating from outside our solar system. The announcement was made during a news conference on November 19 in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it addresses speculation surrounding the comet’s unusual trajectory and size, which had led to theories, including a controversial claim by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggesting it could be alien technology. NASA’s release of new images and data aims to provide a clearer understanding of the comet's characteristics and its differences from comets within our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19 at a distance of 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured some of the closest images of the comet during its pass within 19 million miles of Mars.</li>
    <li>A dozen NASA missions, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Telescope, have been involved in observing the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will continue its journey through the solar system, passing the orbit of Jupiter in spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope. In August, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope observed the comet, followed by imagery captured by the James Webb Telescope and SPHEREx later that month. The comet made its closest approach to Mars, approximately 19 million miles away, where it was observed by multiple NASA spacecraft.</p>

<p>NASA has conducted a solar system-wide observation campaign to gather data on 3I/ATLAS. As the comet approaches Earth, more telescopes, including those operated by amateur astronomers, are expected to join in the observation efforts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By comparing and contrasting all these views, our most complete understanding of 3I/ATLAS will emerge. And the game’s not done yet,” said a NASA panelist during the news conference.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this confirmation, the unusual characteristics of Comet 3I/ATLAS had sparked debates among scientists and the public. Speculations were intensified by a delay in releasing images due to the Federal government shutdown, which led to increased interest and theories surrounding the object.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as an interstellar object because its hyperbolic trajectory indicates it originated from outside the solar system, marking it as the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth and during its journey toward Jupiter in 2026. The agency aims to gather more data to enhance understanding of its composition and how it differs from comets within our solar system.</p>
