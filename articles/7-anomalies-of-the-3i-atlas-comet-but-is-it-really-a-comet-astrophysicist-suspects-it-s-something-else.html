      <h2>7 anomalies of the 3I/ATLAS comet: But is it really a comet? Astrophysicist suspects it's something else</h2>

<p>Astrophysicist Prof. Avi Loeb has identified seven anomalies associated with the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which entered our Solar System in July 2025. The findings have sparked debate about whether 3I/ATLAS is a comet or a technological artifact, as its features deviate from typical natural interstellar objects.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it challenges existing models of celestial objects and raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Astronomers are closely monitoring the object, as its unique characteristics could offer new insights into the origins of interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter exceeds 5 km, potentially up to 20 km or more.</li>
    <li>Orbital inclination is only 5 degrees relative to the ecliptic.</li>
    <li>Discovery occurred at 4.5 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Timing allows for close passages by Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.</li>
    <li>Alignment with the "Wow! Signal" is within 9 degrees.</li>
    <li>Loeb's "Loeb Scale" ranks 3I/ATLAS at least 2 for technological potential.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. It entered the Solar System from a distant star system, exhibiting several anomalies that differ from typical comets or asteroids.</p>
<p>As astronomers gathered data, they noted the unusual features of 3I/ATLAS, leading to increased scrutiny and analysis, particularly by Prof. Loeb.</p>
<p>Further observations are planned, including from Mars orbiters in October 2025, to gather more information about the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While natural explanations exist for each anomaly individually, explaining all seven simultaneously strains conventional models,” said Prof. Loeb. “Ongoing observations are crucial for resolution.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, had been confirmed. Both were significantly smaller than 3I/ATLAS, with diameters of 0.2 km and 1 km, respectively. The rarity of large interstellar objects adds to the significance of this discovery.</p>
<p>The anomalies identified by Loeb challenge existing astrophysical theories and raise the possibility of technological origins, a notion that has garnered both interest and skepticism within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, with observations planned from Mars orbiters in October 2025 to further investigate its characteristics and origins.</p>
