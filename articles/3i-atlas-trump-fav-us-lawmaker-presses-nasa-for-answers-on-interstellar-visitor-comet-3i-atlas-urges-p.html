      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Trump-fav US lawmaker presses NASA for answers on ‘interstellar visitor’ comet</h2>

<p>US Representative Anna Paulina Luna has demanded answers from NASA regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which recently passed approximately 130 million miles from Earth. In a letter sent on October 31, the Florida Republican urged acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy to release more data and imagery related to the comet.</p>

<p>Luna's request highlights the growing scientific interest in 3I/ATLAS, which has captured the attention of astronomers worldwide due to its unique composition and origins. The congresswoman has called for further observation of the comet using NASA's Juno mission, emphasizing the potential for valuable insights into its characteristics and interactions within the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet was detected about 130 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has identified signs of ice at the comet's nucleus.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is primarily composed of nickel alloy, according to reports.</li>
    <li>Luna has previously raised questions about UFOs during congressional hearings.</li>
    <li>The request for data was made in a letter to NASA on October 31, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 31, 2023, Representative Anna Paulina Luna sent a letter to NASA's acting Administrator Sean Duffy, requesting additional data and imagery of comet 3I/ATLAS. In her communication, she stressed the importance of this information for understanding interstellar visitors and their interactions with the solar system.</p>

<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention from both the scientific community and the public, with various experts weighing in on its potential implications for understanding extraterrestrial life and the early universe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,” Luna wrote in her letter to NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We should not hold science hostage to the shutdown politics of the day,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who praised Luna's request for data in a Medium post.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is gaining attention not only for its unique characteristics but also for its potential to inform research on interstellar objects. Previous interstellar visitors, such as ʻOumuamua, have sparked debates about the origins and nature of such phenomena, particularly regarding possible extraterrestrial connections.</p>

<p>NASA's ongoing research into interstellar comets is critical as scientists seek to expand knowledge about the materials and conditions present in other solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following Luna's request, NASA may consider prioritizing additional observations of 3I/ATLAS using the Juno mission. The agency's response to the letter and any forthcoming data release remains pending.</p>
