      <h2>3I/ATLAS Images: Harvard Scientist Accuses NASA Of Not Sharing Doomsday Comet’s Photo From Mars Flyby</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has accused NASA of not sharing images of the comet 3I/ATLAS, which flew near Mars on October 2, 2025. Loeb made these claims during a podcast appearance on ‘The Joe Rogan Experience,’ stating that his request for the images obtained by NASA’s HiRISE camera has gone unanswered.</p>

<p>This matter has raised questions about transparency in scientific communication. Loeb argues that the undisclosed images could contradict NASA's assertion that 3I/ATLAS’s tail transformed into a typical comet tail. He has pointed to unusual features of the comet, including its composition and acceleration, as reasons for concern.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Comet 3I/ATLAS flyby near Mars</li>
    <li>Date: October 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Capturing Agency: NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
    <li>Camera: HiRISE</li>
    <li>Request for images: Sent by Avi Loeb, received no response</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2025, the comet 3I/ATLAS came within 30 million kilometers of Mars. The images of this event were captured by NASA’s HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Avi Loeb requested these images but reported that he received no response from the principal investigator of HiRISE.</p>

<p>During a podcast on October 28, 2025, Loeb discussed his concerns regarding the comet’s behavior and composition, suggesting that the images could challenge NASA's public statements about the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The best image was obtained on Oct. 2, 2025, when 3I/ATLAS came within 30 million kilometers of Mars,” said Avi Loeb during the podcast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These alleged images would have disproved NASA’s public claim that 3I/ATLAS’s bizarre tail turned into a typical comet tail,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Professor of Particle Physics Brian Cox stated, “Comet 3I/Atlas is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff. It is entirely natural in origin.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has previously suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien reconnaissance probe, a claim that has sparked debate within the scientific community. Critics, including Professor Brian Cox, emphasize that the comet is a natural celestial body, dismissing speculations about its extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<p>Loeb's assertions have led to increased public interest and scrutiny regarding NASA's handling of astronomical data, particularly concerning objects of potential significance to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no announced investigations or follow-up actions regarding Loeb's claims. The scientific community continues to analyze 3I/ATLAS as it follows its trajectory, with attention on its potential implications for future research.</p>
