      <h2>Fears New Jersey drones have returned as people spot 'triangle of UFOs' in sky</h2>

<p>Residents of Toronto have reported sightings of a triangular formation of glowing orbs in the sky on September 23, 2025, around 8:20 p.m. A video shared on social media claims to show the phenomenon, which lasted approximately 30 seconds before fading from view.</p>

<p>The recent sightings have sparked concerns among locals, with some believing that these orbs may be linked to previous UFO reports. Authorities are not currently investigating the sightings, but the situation has renewed interest in the possibility of unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on September 23, 2025, at approximately 8:20 p.m.</li>
    <li>Location: Brooklin, east of Toronto, Ontario</li>
    <li>Duration of sighting: about 30 seconds</li>
    <li>Video shared on social media, capturing three glowing orbs</li>
    <li>Multiple reports of similar sightings across various locations, including New Jersey</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 23, 2025, a social media user posted a video claiming to capture three glowing orbs in a triangular formation above Brooklin, Ontario. The video was recorded by the user’s brother, who saw the orbs for about 30 seconds before they disappeared.</p>
<p>Following this sighting, numerous comments on the video indicated that others had witnessed similar phenomena around the same time, both in Toronto and in other regions, including New Jersey.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“So many sightings today, holy s***,” commented one user on the video, reflecting the widespread interest and concern regarding the sightings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Another user noted, “Looks like 'drone' season is upon us... only much bigger and more absurd.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Last year, New Jersey experienced a wave of UFO sightings, leading to speculation about a possible government cover-up. The FBI launched an investigation into these incidents. In January, former President Donald Trump revealed that the drones sighted were authorized by the FAA for “research and various other reasons.”</p>
<p>Reports also indicate that the military has a history of disseminating false information regarding UFOs to conceal classified programs, adding to public skepticism about the authenticity of such sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, no official investigations are underway regarding the recent Toronto sightings. Authorities have not disclosed any plans to address the public's concerns or investigate the phenomena further.</p>
