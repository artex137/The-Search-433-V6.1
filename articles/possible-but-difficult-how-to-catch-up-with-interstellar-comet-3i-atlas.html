      <h2>Possible, but difficult: how to catch up with interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has presented significant challenges for scientists aiming to study it, according to a recent article published on the arXiv preprint website. The comet, which passed through the Solar System in 2025, travels at a heliocentric velocity of 58 km/s, complicating any potential mission to intercept it.</p>

<p>This matter is important as it highlights the limitations of current space technology and the need for future advancements. Researchers have explored the feasibility of sending a spacecraft to catch up with 3I/ATLAS, emphasizing the complexities involved in such a mission.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has a heliocentric velocity of <strong>58 km/s</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet left the inner Solar System before a direct launch could occur.</li>
    <li>A proposed launch date for a flyby mission is <strong>2035</strong>.</li>
    <li>The interception of the comet would occur at approximately <strong>732 AU</strong> from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The spacecraft would need a nuclear power source for long-distance communication.</li>
    <li>The mission would require a super-heavy Starship rocket, which is still in the testing phase.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The exploration of a mission to intercept comet 3I/ATLAS began after its discovery in 2025. The comet's high velocity and late discovery posed significant challenges, preventing a direct launch from Earth. Researchers proposed a theoretical plan that includes launching a spacecraft toward the Sun in 2035, utilizing gravitational forces for acceleration.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the Sun, the spacecraft would perform an Obert maneuver. Afterward, it would head towards Jupiter for additional acceleration. This proposed mission, however, remains theoretical and would require overcoming numerous technical challenges.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Although in theory the mission to intercept the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is possible, it is extremely complex and costly to implement in practice at this time,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The challenges presented by 3I/ATLAS reflect broader issues in space exploration. Current technology limits our ability to intercept fast-moving interstellar objects. The situation underscores the necessity for new powerful telescopes that could detect such objects well in advance, which may lead to more feasible missions, such as the proposed Comet Interceptor mission.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As researchers continue to explore the theoretical aspects of the mission, there is a pressing need to develop new telescopes and technologies. Future advancements will determine the feasibility of intercepting interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS and enhancing our understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>
