      <h2>‘UFO’ spotted floating around active volcano</h2>

<p>A ‘UFO’ has been spotted floating around the Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico on October 30, 2023. Webcam footage captured the glowing object hovering near the crater before it quickly zips away. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the sighting.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant as it coincides with increased volcanic activity. Authorities have not commented on the nature or origin of the object. The National Center for Disaster Prevention has urged the public to maintain a safe distance from the volcano due to its ongoing eruptions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Popocatepetl volcano, Puebla and Morelos, Mexico</li>
    <li>Altitude: 5,426 metres (17,802 feet)</li>
    <li>Date of sighting: October 30, 2023</li>
    <li>Reported eruptions: 19 low-intensity eruptions</li>
    <li>Exclusion zone: 12 kilometres around the crater</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2023, monitoring cameras at Popocatepetl captured footage of a glowing object hovering around the volcano as smoke and flames erupted from the crater. The National Center for Disaster Prevention reported 19 low-intensity eruptions that same day, prompting warnings for the public to avoid the area.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The authorities have not issued a statement on the origin of the mysterious flying object,” the report states.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The National Center for Disaster Prevention called on the public to stay away from the crater and respect the 12-kilometre exclusion zone,” according to the same report.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Popocatepetl is one of Mexico's most active volcanoes, with a history of eruptions. Last year, UFO expert Jaime Maussan claimed that the volcano may serve as an “inter-dimensional portal,” allowing intergalactic travelers to enter from one place to another. He stated that temperatures within the crater reach around 1,000 degrees Celsius, making it impossible for man-made objects to enter.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to monitor volcanic activity and have not disclosed any plans for further investigation into the sighting of the UFO. The public is advised to adhere to safety guidelines regarding the exclusion zone.</p>
