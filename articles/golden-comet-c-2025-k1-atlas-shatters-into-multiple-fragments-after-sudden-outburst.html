      <h2>Golden comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) shatters into multiple fragments after sudden outburst</h2>

<p>The comet C/2025 K1, known as ATLAS, has fragmented in space following a sudden brightening earlier this month, according to newly released images. The disintegration occurred after the comet reached perihelion on 8 October, when it passed within about 50 million kilometres of the Sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it diminishes the potential for detailed study of the comet's composition during its close approach to Earth on 25 November. Astronomers had anticipated that the intense gravitational forces during its solar passage would affect its structure. However, initial observations suggested it had survived intact until its unexpected break-up.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered in May by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on 8 October, passing within approximately 50 million kilometres of the Sun.</li>
    <li>Fragmentation was first observed on 13 November, with at least three principal pieces noted.</li>
    <li>A fourth smaller fragment has also separated but is not visible in current animations.</li>
    <li>Remnants of the comet are expected to be observable in the constellation Leo with good amateur telescopes or binoculars.</li>
    <li>The comet's unusual golden colour indicates a low abundance of carbon-bearing molecules.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>
    - **May 2025**: C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is discovered by ATLAS.<br>
    - **8 October 2025**: The comet reaches perihelion.<br>
    - **13 November 2025**: Astronomers confirm the comet has fragmented.<br>
    - **12-20 November 2025**: Austrian astrophotographer Michael Jäger publishes a time-lapse showing the comet's disintegration.
</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Astronomers had not expected the comet to withstand its close solar passage,” said David Schleicher of Lowell Observatory in Arizona.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>C/2025 K1 is often referred to as the “other ATLAS” to differentiate it from the more widely discussed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Both comets were detected by the same survey but are unrelated. C/2025 K1's unique chemical composition, particularly low levels of carbon-bearing molecules, had made it a target for research prior to its disintegration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The remnants of C/2025 K1 will continue to be observed as they drift apart. Astronomers will monitor the fragments and assess any potential for future study as they move through the constellation Leo.</p>
