      <h2>Anomalous radio signal from comet 3I/ATLAS puts space agencies on global alert</h2>

<p>Space agencies worldwide have mobilized following the detection of an anomalous radio signal from comet 3I/ATLAS, identified as the third known interstellar visitor to enter our solar system, on October 24, 2025. The signal's unusual characteristics have prompted a global network of telescopes and observatories to collaborate in analyzing the data.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it presents a unique scientific opportunity to study the comet's composition and trajectory. Authorities are prioritizing the investigation of the signal's origin, which differs from known cometary emissions. Preliminary assessments indicate no risk of collision with Earth, allowing researchers to focus on understanding the comet's properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS warning system.</li>
    <li>Signal captured on October 24, 2025, by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Signal recorded at a frequency of 1.6 GHz, not typical for natural cometary processes.</li>
    <li>Collaboration includes the Very Large Telescope in Chile and the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>European Space Agency (ESA) is also providing observational support.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was identified by the ATLAS warning system.</p>
<p>The MeerKAT radio telescope captured the anomalous signal on October 24, 2025.</p>
<p>The closest approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2025, providing an opportunity for enhanced observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The emission was recorded in a narrow band at a frequency of 1.6 GHz, raising questions about the physical mechanisms that could be generating such a phenomenon,” a spokesperson for the scientific community said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is classified as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic trajectory. This classification indicates it did not originate from the Solar System and is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. The comet is unique compared to previous interstellar visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, due to its distinct activity and radio emissions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are currently investigating two primary hypotheses regarding the radio signal: one suggesting a natural cause related to magnetic interactions and the other considering the possibility of an artificial origin. Further observations and analyses are planned to clarify the nature of the emissions.</p>
