      <h2>New comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) is becoming more visible</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) has become more visible since its confirmation in September 2025, reaching a brightness of approximately magnitude 5.9, according to comet expert Michael Mattiazzo. The comet is currently located in the western sky after sunset, particularly visible for observers in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>This increase in visibility is significant for both amateur and professional astronomers. Authorities and experts are encouraging skywatchers to look for the comet, which may be visible with binoculars and through long-exposure photography. Mattiazzo captured an image of the comet using a 200mm lens, showing its impressive tail.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) confirmed on September 12, 2025</li>
    <li>Current brightness: approximately magnitude 5.9</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: October 19, 2025, at about 39 million km</li>
    <li>Comet orbits the Sun every 22,554 years</li>
    <li>Initial sightings reported from Australia and Zacatecas, Mexico</li>
    <li>Best viewing conditions are in the Southern Hemisphere</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) instrument on the SOHO spacecraft confirmed Comet C/2025 R2 on September 12, 2025. Observers, including Michael Mattiazzo, reported its brightness and captured images shortly after its discovery.</p>
<p>The comet moved past Mars and the star Spica in Virgo, crossing into Libra on September 28 and Scorpius on October 10. Its closest approach to Earth is set for October 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was able to visually see it this morning using 15 x 70 binoculars from Australia,” said Michael Mattiazzo. “I originally expected to be searching for a small, faint patch.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Martin Mašek of the Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences stated, “I was very pleasantly surprised by such a bright comet with a long tail.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the first significant appearance of Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) since it was too close to the Sun to observe. Its brightness has increased due to a temporary outburst, making it a rare opportunity for observers.</p>
<p>Previous comets have shown erratic behavior, making their visibility unpredictable. This comet's orbit of over 22,000 years adds to its uniqueness as a celestial event.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet continues to brighten, observers are encouraged to look for it after sunset. It is expected to remain a point of interest for astronomers, with updates on its trajectory and visibility forthcoming as more data is collected.</p>
