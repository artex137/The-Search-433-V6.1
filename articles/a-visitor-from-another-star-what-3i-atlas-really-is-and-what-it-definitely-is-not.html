      <h2>A visitor from another star: What 3I/ATLAS really is – and what it definitely is not</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, a newly discovered interstellar object, is currently sweeping through our Solar System, having been detected on 1 July 2025 by astronomers using a NASA-funded telescope in Chile. This comet, which originates from another star system, has sparked a wave of speculation on social media, with some claiming it to be an alien spacecraft, but astronomers insist it is a natural cosmic phenomenon.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unique characteristics and the scientific opportunities it presents. NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft is poised to cross the comet's ion tail between 30 October and 6 November 2025, providing a rare chance to collect interstellar material. This event could enhance our understanding of planetary systems and the conditions that create comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on 1 July 2025</li>
  <li>Travelling at approximately <strong>210,000 km/h</strong></li>
  <li>Expected to cross the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS between <strong>30 October and 6 November 2025</strong></li>
  <li>Comet's unusual chemistry includes nickel and minimal iron</li>
  <li>NASA's Europa Clipper launched in <strong>2024</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers detected a faint object moving rapidly across the sky, which was confirmed to be 3I/ATLAS. Unlike typical comets that orbit the Sun, this comet follows an open, hyperbolic path, indicating it is a one-time visitor from another star system. As it approaches the Sun, it has exhibited significant activity, with jets of water vapour and carbon dioxide observed.</p>

<p>The Europa Clipper spacecraft, launched in 2024, is on a mission to study Jupiter’s moon Europa. By chance, its trajectory will intersect with 3I/ATLAS's ion tail during the comet's closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, providing a unique opportunity for data collection.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “All available evidence overwhelmingly points to a natural origin,” said NASA scientists regarding 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Physicist Brian Cox stated, “It is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices, not a starship.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, astronomers had only identified two other interstellar visitors: ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each of these objects presented unique characteristics, but 3I/ATLAS challenges existing theories about comets due to its high speed and unusual chemical composition. This comet's arrival underscores the diversity of planetary systems in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the date for Europa Clipper's potential interaction with 3I/ATLAS approaches, scientists are preparing for the possibility of collecting data from interstellar material. However, a government shutdown in the United States, which commenced on 1 October 2025, has paused many NASA operations, potentially affecting the mission's success.</p>
