      <h2>Rare interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS captivates astronomers as it speeds through solar system</h2>

<p>Hyderabad: The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by researchers from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Chile, has drawn significant attention from astronomers and stargazers worldwide as it travels through our solar system.</p>

<p>This comet is notable as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object to have originated from another star system. Its unique characteristics provide a rare opportunity for scientists to study the composition and environment of other star systems, according to experts. Major astronomy groups and observatories, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, are currently observing 3I/ATLAS to gather more data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 20 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 210,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Objects:</strong> Oumuamua and 2I Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Current Observers:</strong> Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, various astronomical agencies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by researchers from the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Since its discovery, it has been the focus of intense scientific study due to its unique interstellar origin.</p>
<p>As the comet approached the Sun, its icy core heated up, leading to the formation of a glowing cloud of dust and a tail, typical of cometary activity. This behavior has led to a consensus among astronomers that 3I/ATLAS is indeed a comet, despite its interstellar nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The opportunity to study the composition of this interstellar comet is invaluable for our understanding of other star systems,” said a representative from the ATLAS survey team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system, following Oumuamua and 2I Borisov. Oumuamua was characterized by its elongated shape and lack of cometary activity, while 2I Borisov exhibited typical cometary traits. The study of interstellar comets helps astronomers gain insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, collecting data to better understand its composition and behavior. Further observations are planned using various telescopes and observational techniques.</p>
