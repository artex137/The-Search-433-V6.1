      <h2>Hubble Takes New Look at Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has captured a new image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, taken on November 30, 2025. At that time, the comet was approximately 286 million km (178 million miles) from Earth. This comet is only the third of its kind ever observed.</p>

<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides insights into the characteristics of interstellar objects. Astronomers have utilized Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) to track the comet's movement across the sky, revealing distinct features such as a teardrop-shaped halo. The continued observation of 3I/ATLAS is expected as it moves out of the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>At its closest approach to Mars, the comet was 0.194 AU away on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will approach Jupiter at a distance of 0.357 AU on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The new image shows a halo with a radius of about 40,000 km (24,855 miles) and an anti-tail extension reaching approximately 60,000 km (37,282 miles).</li>
    <li>Hubble previously observed 3I/ATLAS in July 2025, shortly after its discovery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, at a distance of 4.51 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. It made a close approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, before reaching perihelion on October 30, 2025. The latest observation by Hubble occurred on November 30, 2025.</p>

<p>In the months following its discovery, several NASA missions have studied the comet. Observations are expected to continue for several more months as 3I/ATLAS travels beyond the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Hubble tracked the comet as it moved across the sky,” said astronomers in a statement. “As a result, background stars appear as streaks of light.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The image shows a teardrop-shaped glowing halo that extends towards the Sun,” said Harvard University’s Professor Avi Loeb regarding the new Hubble image.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I predicted that by November 30th, the swarm of objects would be closer to the Sun than 3I/ATLAS by about 60,000 km if the objects overlapped with 3I/ATLAS at perihelion,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar object observed by astronomers. The study of such comets helps scientists understand the formation and evolution of solar systems.</p>

<p>The previous observations of 3I/ATLAS have provided crucial data on its trajectory and physical characteristics, enhancing the understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/ATLAS are expected to continue as it moves further from the Sun, allowing astronomers to gather more data on its behavior and structure.</p>
