      <h2>Astronomer Avi Loeb suggests that comet 3I/ATLAS’s tail resembles rocket exhaust</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has passed its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, approximately 270 million kilometers away. The comet, which is the third object identified from outside the Solar System, is currently moving towards Jupiter, where it is expected to arrive in March 2026.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the comet's unusual characteristics and origin. Astronomers have been monitoring 3I/ATLAS since its discovery in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet exhibits features such as a long antitail and larger dust particles, prompting ongoing debate about its composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is moving towards Jupiter, expected to cross in March 2026.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has an estimated nucleus diameter of between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The antitail is 400,000 kilometers long and has a particle flow exceeding natural models.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by astronomers using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. It approached Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 270 million kilometers. The comet is currently on a hyperbolic trajectory towards Jupiter, which it will reach in March 2026.</p>
<p>Recent observations, including images from the Hubble and Gemini telescopes, have confirmed the presence of the antitail, which persists even after the comet’s perihelion in October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The ejection speed of these particles exceeds what ice sublimation could drive naturally,” said Avi Loeb from Harvard University.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Natural explanations require unrealistic efficiency, while a technological origin would resolve the discrepancies,” Loeb added regarding the comet's unusual features.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov as the third interstellar object documented by astronomers. These objects provide valuable insights into material from other star systems, enhancing the understanding of planetary formation processes beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers plan to conduct additional observations of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026. These observations aim to gather data on the comet's chemical composition and ejection velocity, which may provide further insights into its origins.</p>
