      <h2>The B-2 bomber looks like a UFO: But the truth may be stranger</h2>

<p>The B-2 stealth bomber, with its dark, delta-wing silhouette, has drawn comparisons to UFOs, particularly the “black triangle” sightings reported during the Cold War. Pentagon officials have stated that the aircraft’s design is the result of human engineering, not extraterrestrial influence.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights the intersection of military technology and public perception. The B-2's resemblance to unidentified flying objects has contributed to longstanding conspiracy theories about alien technology being reverse-engineered for military use.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The B-2 bomber's design mirrors Cold War-era UFO reports.</li>
    <li>Pentagon officials assert the aircraft is a product of human engineering.</li>
    <li>Northrop's flying wing experiments began in the 1930s.</li>
    <li>Secret test flights of aircraft like the U-2 and B-2 may have led to UFO sightings.</li>
    <li>The B-2 operates silently with no visible engines, enhancing its UFO-like appearance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The B-2 stealth bomber was developed in the late 20th century, with its design influenced by earlier flying wing experiments from the 1930s.</p>
<p>During the 1950s and 1960s, the U-2 and B-2 underwent secret test flights, which coincided with numerous reported UFO sightings.</p>
<p>Public fascination with the B-2 as a potential UFO has persisted, fueled by popular culture and speculation about advanced military technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The B-2’s stealthy shape is purely human—born from Cold War radar evasion, not extraterrestrial engineering,” Pentagon officials said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “When civilians saw something unearthly, they often weren’t wrong—just uninformed,” experts noted regarding past UFO sightings.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Reports of UFO sightings peaked during the Cold War, coinciding with the development of advanced military aircraft. The B-2’s design has contributed to ongoing debates about military secrecy and public understanding of advanced technology.</p>
<p>As military advancements continue, the relationship between new technologies and public perception remains a topic of interest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no announced investigations regarding the B-2's design or its public perception. The military continues to focus on advancing technology while managing public knowledge of its capabilities.</p>
