      <h2>Mystery over Minneapolis as police stunned by 'ringed' UFO defying laws of physics</h2>

<p>Three Minneapolis police officers have reported an encounter with a spherical Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) displaying six glowing rings that changed colors. The incident occurred in February near Minnesota's Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant, and the report was shared publicly by Ryan Graves, a former US Navy pilot, on X on Monday. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant due to the location's strategic importance and has sparked interest among UFO researchers. Authorities are now reviewing the report, which details a near-proximity encounter between the UAP and a civilian helicopter. The officers have filed their observations with Americans for Safe Aerospace, a non-profit organization dedicated to advocating for transparency in UAP research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in February 2023.</li>
    <li>Location: Near Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant, Minnesota.</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Three Minneapolis police officers.</li>
    <li>UAP observed at approximately 10,000 feet.</li>
    <li>UAP displayed six glowing rings that changed colors.</li>
    <li>A similar sighting occurred on July 7, 2023, in Anoka, Minnesota.</li>
    <li>Reports filed with Americans for Safe Aerospace.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In February 2023, three Minneapolis police officers observed a UAP from a parking garage using binoculars. One officer drove toward the object while the others continued to watch. The officers described the UAP as hovering and capable of both slow and hypersonic speeds, generating lift without sound.</p>
<p>On July 7, 2023, another UAP sighting was reported in Anoka, Minnesota, approximately one mile from the original witness. This object was said to have traveled along the Mississippi River at around 460 mph before abruptly slowing and descending silently behind trees.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The ISS has flown over the area for the last few days and was very bright. What we see in the video could be the ISS, but we will need more details to rule it out,” said Alejandro Rojas, an advisor at Enigma Labs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The video also doesn't look like 'six interlocking rings of colored lights.' A small point of light in the distance can appear to be multiple colors when it is not, due to the atmosphere between the witness and the object,” Rojas added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior incidents involving UAPs have drawn public attention, particularly those reported by military personnel. Ryan Graves, the founder of Americans for Safe Aerospace, has previously testified before Congress regarding the risks posed by unidentified objects to aviation safety. He has revealed that Navy pilots regularly encountered such objects during training missions off the East Coast between 2014 and 2015.</p>
<p>Graves has emphasized the need for transparency in UAP research, stating that these encounters have become a routine topic in pre-flight safety briefings for pilots.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the sightings are ongoing, and Americans for Safe Aerospace is expected to release additional reports. The organization has collected nearly 1,000 reports from credible witnesses, including military and law enforcement personnel.</p>
