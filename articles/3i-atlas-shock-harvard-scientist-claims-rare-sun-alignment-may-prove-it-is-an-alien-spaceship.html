      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shock: Harvard Scientist Claims Rare Sun Alignment May Prove It Is An Alien Spaceship</h2>

<p>On 22 January 2026, a rare cosmic alignment will focus attention on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has sparked debate among scientists about its nature. Discovered on 1 July 2025 by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile, 3I/ATLAS is currently travelling at a speed of 61 kilometres per second.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it may provide crucial data regarding the object's composition and trajectory, which some experts, including Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb, have suggested could indicate artificial origins. Authorities and researchers are preparing to observe the alignment, hoping to gather unprecedented data during the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: ATLAS station, Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Speed upon entering the solar system: 61 km/s</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): 29 October 2025</li>
    <li>Peak alignment time: 13:00 UTC on 22 January 2026</li>
    <li>Next close encounter: 17 March 2026, within 30.46 million kilometres of Jupiter's moon Eupheme</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025. It entered the solar system, exhibiting unusual characteristics that diverged from typical comet behaviour. The object reached perihelion on 29 October 2025, remaining largely unobserved from Earth during its closest pass to the Sun. The upcoming alignment from 19 to 26 January 2026 is expected to allow for detailed observations.</p>

<p>On 22 January 2026, the alignment will reach its peak, providing a unique opportunity for astronomers to study the object without interference from shadows.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Observations before and after the alignment time offer an unprecedented opportunity for characterising the albedo, structure, and composition of interstellar matter,” said Professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The phase angle between the Sun-3I/ATLAS axis and the Sun-Earth axis, will reach a value of 0.69 degrees,” Loeb explained in relation to the alignment.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has led to speculation about its origins. Loeb has previously suggested that it may be a form of alien technology, a notion that has divided the scientific community.</p>

<p>The object’s trajectory and composition raise questions about the potential for similar future discoveries and their implications for our understanding of the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the alignment approaches, astronomers are preparing to observe 3I/ATLAS with powerful telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble. The data collected during this period could provide insights into the object's nature and inform future research on interstellar objects.</p>
