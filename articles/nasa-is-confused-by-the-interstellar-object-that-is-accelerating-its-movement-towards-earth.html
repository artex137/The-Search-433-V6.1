      <h2>NASA is confused by the interstellar object that is accelerating its movement towards Earth</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar object, known as 3I/ATLAS, is approaching Earth at an unexpectedly high speed, prompting confusion among astronomers. NASA has confirmed that the object has received an additional “boost” that cannot be explained by the Sun’s gravity. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this cosmic phenomenon.</p>

<p>This unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it challenges existing scientific understanding of interstellar objects. NASA plans to further investigate the object using the James Webb Space Telescope in December, aiming to uncover the nature of its acceleration and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Current speed: approximately 244,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): October 29</li>
    <li>Initial speed upon entering the solar system: over 209,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: about 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Composition: a mixture of nickel and carbon dioxide</li>
    <li>Expected study date: December 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the solar system at a speed exceeding 209,000 km/h, setting a record for the fastest space rock. Following its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, its speed increased to approximately 244,000 km/h. Observations have noted unusual changes in the object's color and shine, turning blue as it neared the Sun.</p>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has raised questions about the object’s classification as a comet, noting that it shows little evidence of gas release typical of comets. This has led to speculation regarding its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS has not lost enough mass near the Sun, its acceleration must have a cause other than the comet's evaporation,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the mystery surrounding the object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS represents a new challenge for scientists studying interstellar objects. While most agree that it formed in another star system, its unusual trajectory, size, and composition set it apart from typical comets, which are generally composed of ice and water.</p>

<p>The scientific community is closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it may provide insights into the nature of objects originating beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will conduct further studies on 3I/ATLAS with the James Webb Space Telescope in December 2023 to search for any gas clouds that might explain its unexpected behavior and characteristics.</p>
