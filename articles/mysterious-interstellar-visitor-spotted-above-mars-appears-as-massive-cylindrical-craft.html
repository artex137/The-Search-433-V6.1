      <h2>Mysterious interstellar visitor spotted above Mars appears as 'massive cylindrical craft'</h2>

<p>NASA's Perseverance rover has captured extraordinary images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it made a close pass by Mars. The new photos depict what appears to be a massive cylindrical shape, raising questions among scientists and stargazers alike. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The significance of these images lies in the ongoing debate about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. While many scientists classify it as a comet, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested it may be an extraterrestrial craft. He has been asked by Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna to examine the new images further.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Location: Above Mars</li>
    <li>Time of close pass: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Diameter: Potentially more than 45 kilometers</li>
    <li>Key researchers: Avi Loeb and Dr. Horace Drew</li>
    <li>Images captured by: NASA's Perseverance rover</li>
    <li>Next image expected from: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed as it travels through our solar system. NASA's Perseverance rover recently sent back images showing the object with a distinct shape that some interpret as cylindrical.</p>

<p>On social media, stargazers have enhanced these images, revealing a green glow around the object. This has led to differing interpretations among scientists regarding its true nature.</p>

<p>Loeb noted that while he is skeptical about the cylindrical shape, he is looking forward to clearer images from the HiRISE camera on the MRO.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The stripe in the Navcam image must have resulted from stacking hundreds of Navcam images over a total time interval of about 10 minutes,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It is not a ‘comet’,” Dr. Horace Drew declared on a post on X Monday morning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We can see an extended white shape, with a green coma outside. Not a small white ball,” Drew explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation follows the encounter with another interstellar object, Oumuamua, which passed Earth in 2017. Loeb has previously theorized that 3I/ATLAS could be a second craft sent by extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<p>The debate surrounding the nature of 3I/ATLAS highlights ongoing discussions in the scientific community about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and advanced technologies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to release additional images from the HiRISE camera, which may provide clearer insights into the shape and composition of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb has emphasized that these findings could be crucial in determining what the object truly is.</p>
