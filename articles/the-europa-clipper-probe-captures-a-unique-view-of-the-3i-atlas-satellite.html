      <h2>The Europa Clipper probe captures a unique view of the 3I/ATLAS satellite</h2>

<p>The Europa Clipper spacecraft has made unprecedented observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a unique orbital window in November 2025, according to the Southwest Research Institute. The spacecraft, launched in 2024, is expected to arrive at the Jovian system in 2030.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it enhances understanding of cometary tails and the physical-chemical processes occurring in comets. The Europa Clipper team noted that this opportunity to observe 3I/ATLAS was unexpected, and these findings may provide insights into the comet's origin and evolution.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet had a heliocentric distance of 4.51 astronomical units at the time of discovery.</li>
    <li>Its orbital eccentricity is 6.13, indicating an interstellar trajectory.</li>
    <li>The Europa Clipper made observations in November 2025, when Earth-based views were obstructed by the Sun.</li>
    <li>The spacecraft is expected to perform 49 close flybys of Europa after arriving at the Jovian system in 2030.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. A week later, analysts from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory confirmed its trajectory through the Solar System. This confirmation allowed for adjustments in observation strategies.</p>

<p>In November 2025, the Europa Clipper utilized a unique vantage point to observe 3I/ATLAS, capturing data from behind the comet's tails, which are typically oriented away from the Sun. This perspective is rare for scientific instruments.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are thrilled that this opportunity to observe another target on its way to Jupiter was completely unexpected,” said Dr. Kurt Retherford, principal investigator of the Europa-UVS mission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Understanding the comet’s composition and the ease with which these gases are emitted can shed light on its origin and evolution as it transits the Galaxy,” said Dr. Tracy Becker of the Southwest Research Institute.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This mission contributes to ongoing research into the physical and chemical processes of comets, which are thought to provide insights into the early Solar System. The unique observations from the Europa Clipper may help scientists understand the similarities between 3I/ATLAS and other comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Europa Clipper team will continue to analyze the data collected during the observations of 3I/ATLAS. Insights gained may inform future research on cometary behavior and the formation of the Solar System.</p>
