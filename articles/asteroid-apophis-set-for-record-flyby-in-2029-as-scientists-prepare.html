      <h2>Asteroid Apophis Set for Record Flyby in 2029 as Scientists Prepare</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that asteroid Apophis, measuring approximately 340 metres across, will make a close approach to Earth on 13 April 2029. The asteroid will pass just 32,000 kilometres from the planet's surface, which is closer than many geosynchronous satellites. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the flyby.</p>

<p>This unprecedented event is significant for scientists, who aim to gather insights into the behaviour and evolution of ancient space rocks. NASA and the European Space Agency are actively preparing missions to study Apophis during its flyby, marking it as one of the most anticipated scientific occurrences of the decade.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of flyby:</strong> 13 April 2029</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 32,000 km</li>
    <li><strong>Size of Apophis:</strong> 340 metres in diameter</li>
    <li><strong>NASA mission:</strong> OSIRIS-APEX, formerly OSIRIS-REx</li>
    <li><strong>ESA mission:</strong> Ramses</li>
    <li><strong>Initial discovery:</strong> 2004</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated rotation period:</strong> 31 hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Apophis was first discovered in 2004. Early observations raised concerns about a potential impact in the future, but subsequent calculations ruled out any threat for at least the next century. The flyby in 2029 will be the closest predicted approach of an asteroid of this size in recorded history.</p>
<p>As the flyby date approaches, NASA has redirected its OSIRIS-REx spacecraft towards Apophis. This spacecraft will collect high-resolution images and measure surface changes shortly after the flyby. The European Space Agency is also preparing its Ramses mission to accompany Apophis as it passes Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"The 2029 flyby of Apophis is a unique opportunity for scientists to observe how an asteroid responds when it passes through a gravitational field at such close range," said a NASA spokesperson.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The attention surrounding Apophis highlights the growing interest in planetary science. The asteroid's visibility to the naked eye in parts of the Eastern Hemisphere during its flyby will provide a rare chance for the public to witness a significant event in human history.</p>
<p>In addition to Apophis, astronomers are also studying interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has shown signs of natural cometary activity. This ongoing research contributes to the understanding of how interstellar objects behave as they interact with the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the flyby approaches, NASA and ESA will continue preparations for their respective missions. Scientists expect to gather extensive data that will enhance knowledge about asteroid composition, orbital dynamics, and the formation of the solar system.</p>
