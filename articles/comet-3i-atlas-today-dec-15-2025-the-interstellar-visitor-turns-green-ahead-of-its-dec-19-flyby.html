      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Today (Dec. 15, 2025): The Interstellar Visitor Turns Green Ahead of Its Dec. 19 Flyby</h2>

<p>On December 15, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS has attracted attention as it brightens and displays a green glow, with its closest approach to Earth set for December 19, 2025. The comet is currently about 270 million kilometers (170 million miles) away, posing no risk to Earth, according to reports.</p>

<p>Scientists are closely observing the comet as it re-emerges after a solar passage in late October. The comet has shown increased activity, including a more pronounced coma and the appearance of an "anti-tail." This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to be observed, providing a unique opportunity for researchers to study material from another star system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 270 million kilometers (170 million miles) from Earth.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was first reported on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a nucleus size estimated at an upper limit of about 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles).</li>
    <li>The comet's green coloration is linked to diatomic carbon (C₂).</li>
    <li>NASA and multiple agencies are coordinating observations using various telescopes and spacecraft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has undergone several significant observations leading to its current status:</p>
<ul>
    <li>July 1, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS was first reported by the ATLAS survey telescope.</li>
    <li>Late October 2025: The comet passed close to the Sun, leading to changes in its observable characteristics.</li>
    <li>November 30, 2025: NASA's Hubble telescope reobserved the comet, refining estimates of its nucleus and coma.</li>
    <li>December 3, 2025: ESA's XMM-Newton observatory monitored the comet for about 20 hours.</li>
    <li>December 15, 2025: The comet's green glow and anti-tail effect are highlighted in media coverage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comets are time capsules from another planetary system,” a NASA representative said, emphasizing the scientific importance of observing 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is the third confirmed interstellar object observed, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS exhibits a classic cometary structure, including a coma and dust tail, providing insights into the behavior of interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its activity. Observations will help to understand the comet's composition and behavior, particularly regarding the increase in its green glow and the anti-tail feature.</p>
