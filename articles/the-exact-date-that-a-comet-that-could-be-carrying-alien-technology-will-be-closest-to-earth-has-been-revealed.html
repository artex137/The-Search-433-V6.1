      <h2>The exact date that a comet that could be carrying 'alien technology' will be closest to Earth has been revealed</h2>

<p>Scientists have confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will pass nearest to Earth on December 19, 2025. This comet has captured the attention of astronomers and the United Nations due to its unusual characteristics and potential implications for humanity.</p>

<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), endorsed by the UN, has initiated a campaign to monitor 3I/ATLAS. This marks the first time the IAWN has targeted an interstellar object. The campaign follows a White Paper submitted to the UN on September 30, 2025, which proposed a coordinated global effort to study such objects, as some may carry more than cosmic dust. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist and co-author of the paper, has raised concerns about the possibility of interstellar objects carrying alien technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>IAWN Campaign Launch:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Mass:</strong> Roughly a million times more massive than 1I/`Oumuamua</li>
    <li><strong>Scientific Monitoring:</strong> Loeb's Galileo Project observatories are currently scanning for unusual activity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 30, 2025, a White Paper co-authored by Avi Loeb and others proposed monitoring interstellar visitors. Following this, the IAWN launched a campaign to observe 3I/ATLAS, marking the first such initiative for an interstellar object. The comet's perihelion is set for October 29, 2025, and its closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Black swan events with small probabilities must be considered seriously if their implications to the future of humanity are large,” said Avi Loeb, co-author of the White Paper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The clearest technological signature of 3I/ATLAS would be a maneuver or the release of mini-probes near perihelion,” Loeb explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This initiative comes as part of a broader effort to understand interstellar objects, particularly after the discovery of 1I/`Oumuamua in 2017, which sparked discussions about the potential for alien technology. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have led scientists to take its study seriously, as it may provide insights into materials not typically found in comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ground-based observatories worldwide will monitor 3I/ATLAS closely as it approaches Earth. Scientists hope to gather more information about the comet and assess the possibility of detecting any signs of alien technology during its closest approach.</p>
