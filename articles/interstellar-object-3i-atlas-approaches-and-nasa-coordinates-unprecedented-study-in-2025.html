      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS approaches and NASA coordinates unprecedented study in 2025</h2>

<p>An international scientific effort is underway to prepare for the approach of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, set to occur in December 2025. Led by NASA and partner space agencies, this initiative aims to study the third object identified as originating from outside our Solar System, which will pass approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomy as it offers a rare opportunity to analyze materials formed in another star system. Authorities have confirmed that there is no risk of collision with Earth, allowing scientists to focus on collecting valuable data about the comet's composition and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth in December 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Data collection is set to intensify on December 29, 2025, extending for several weeks.</li>
    <li>NASA is collaborating with the European Space Agency (ESA) and other international institutions.</li>
    <li>The comet has an estimated diameter of 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS follows a hyperbolic orbit, indicating it is passing through the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, 3I/ATLAS passed about 30 million kilometers from Mars and reached a distance of 210 million kilometers from the Sun. These encounters provided preliminary data on how the object reacts to solar radiation and the gravitational effects from other celestial bodies.</p>

<p>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, marking a pivotal moment for scientific observation. Following this, the most intensive data collection operation is planned for December 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Despite the proximity, there is no risk of collision with the planet,” a NASA spokesperson said. “The calculated distance provides a considerable safety margin, allowing efforts to focus exclusively on collecting valuable data.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. The rarity of these events emphasizes the critical importance of the upcoming observation for the scientific community.</p>

<p>Previous studies of interstellar objects have contributed to understanding the diversity and structure of stellar systems throughout the Milky Way. Each discovery significantly expands knowledge about cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its passage through Earth, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey through deep space, and it is not expected to return to the Solar System. The upcoming observations in December 2025 are crucial for scientists to analyze the comet's chemical composition and to deepen human understanding of the universe.</p>
