      <h2>Rare Interstellar Comet Racing Through Our Solar System Could Be the Oldest Ever Seen</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), a rare interstellar object, was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. This comet is moving through our Solar System on a one-time visit, traveling at approximately 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph), making it the fastest recorded Solar System visitor.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential age, with scientists estimating it could be 7 to 8 billion years old. This may make it the oldest comet ever observed. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have mobilized global astronomical efforts to study this unique object as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovered by: ATLAS survey telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: ~240 million km (1.6 AU)</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 7–8 billion years</li>
    <li>Global observatories involved: NASA, ESA, various international astronomers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope first identified Comet 3I/ATLAS as it traveled in a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its interstellar origin. Within days, other observatories confirmed its speed and path, verifying it was not bound to the Sun.</p>
<p>The International Astronomical Union officially designated the comet 3I/ATLAS shortly after its discovery. Observations dating back to mid-June 2025 were found, allowing scientists to refine its trajectory, which appears to originate from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects are building blocks of other solar systems that got kicked completely out of their home star,” said Dr. Karen Meech of the University of Hawaiʻi during a live observation session. “Whenever you get one of these – and we’ve only had three – everyone wants to use as much telescope time as possible to see if they’re similar or different to the bodies in our solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its discovery highlights advancements in astronomical technology, particularly the ability of modern sky surveys like ATLAS to detect faint and fast-moving objects from beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the Solar System, astronomers will continue to observe and analyze its composition and behavior. This research will provide valuable insights into the origins of such interstellar objects and their implications for understanding the formation of solar systems.</p>
