      <h2>Trump Orders Release of UFO Files Following Obama's Remarks</h2>

<p>US President Donald Trump has announced plans to instruct federal agencies to begin identifying and releasing files related to extraterrestrial life. The announcement came this week via a post on Truth Social, shortly after former President Barack Obama discussed the topic during a podcast interview.</p>

<p>This development raises questions about the handling of classified information and the ongoing public interest in UFOs. Authorities are now reviewing the implications of Obama's statements and Trump's allegations regarding the disclosure of classified information.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Announcement made by President Trump on Truth Social.</li>
    <li>Directive will be issued to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and relevant departments.</li>
    <li>Obama's comments were made during an interview with journalist Brian Tyler Cohen.</li>
    <li>Obama stated he has never seen aliens but believes they exist.</li>
    <li>Trump accused Obama of revealing classified information, without providing evidence.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon has previously examined unidentified aerial phenomena.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a podcast interview on an unspecified date, former President Barack Obama discussed extraterrestrial life, stating he believes in its existence but has not seen any evidence of contact with Earth. He dismissed conspiracy theories regarding Area 51, asserting that there are no hidden facilities for extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<p>Days later, President Trump reacted to Obama's remarks, claiming he had given out classified information and made a "big mistake." Trump announced plans to direct federal agencies to release UFO-related files, indicating a shift in government policy regarding transparency on this topic.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He gave classified information,” Trump said. “He’s not supposed to be doing that. I don’t know if they’re real or not… I can tell you he gave classified information. He made a big mistake.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Obama commented, “I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Former President Obama’s remarks have reignited interest in UFOs and government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. The Pentagon has investigated such reports in the past, concluding that most sightings can be attributed to misidentified objects or ordinary phenomena, with no evidence of alien visitation confirmed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Federal agencies will begin the process of identifying and releasing files related to extraterrestrial life, as per Trump's directive. The implications of Obama's comments and the accusations from Trump may lead to further scrutiny regarding classified information protocols.</p>
