      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Hubble’s New Image, Psyche’s Data and ‘Ice Volcano’ Hints as of December 5, 2025</h2>

<p>On December 5, 2025, astronomers are closely monitoring interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through our solar system. This comet is only the third known interstellar visitor, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Recent observations, including new images from the Hubble Space Telescope and data from the Psyche mission, have heightened interest in the comet.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to provide insights into the chemistry of other planetary systems. NASA and various international agencies are conducting extensive observations to gather data on the comet's composition and trajectory. The comet is expected to come closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 AU (170 million miles).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS network in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion: October 29, 2025, at approximately 1.36 AU (126–130 million miles).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at about 1.8 AU (170 million miles).</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size: Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers wide.</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during Hubble's latest image: About 178 million miles (286 million km).</li>
    <li>NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS network in Chile. It followed a hyperbolic trajectory indicating its origin from outside the solar system. After perihelion on October 29, observations intensified, with Hubble capturing its latest image on November 30, 2025, while it was 178 million miles from Earth.</p>
<p>On December 3, NASA's Psyche mission reported on its observations of the comet, while the European Space Agency (ESA) provided a navigation camera view from the Juice mission on December 4. These observations contribute to ongoing studies about the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS looks and behaves like a comet,” NASA stated, emphasizing the ongoing nature of observations as the comet exits the inner solar system.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb noted in a Medium post, “The visible glowing halo and potential double tail are exciting, but the real scientific payload will come from Juice’s spectrometers and imagers once the delayed data arrives.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it offers a rare opportunity to study the materials from another planetary system without leaving Earth. Its observations are part of a broader strategy by NASA to improve planetary defense capabilities by tracking interstellar objects.</p>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have sparked interest in the study of cosmic materials and their origins, influencing ongoing research in astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue as it approaches Earth, with data from the Psyche mission and ESA’s Juice expected to enhance our understanding of the comet. The next significant date is December 19, when the comet will be at its closest point to Earth.</p>
