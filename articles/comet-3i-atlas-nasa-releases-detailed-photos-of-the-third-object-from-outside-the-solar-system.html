      <h2>NASA Releases Detailed Photos of Comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>NASA has released detailed photographs of Comet 3I/Atlas, the third object discovered from outside the solar system, following its observation between July and October 2025. The comet, detected on July 1 by the Atlas telescope in Chile, has exhibited typical cometary features, including a coma and a tail formed by gas and dust.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it enhances understanding of the comet's composition and trajectory, providing insights into interstellar objects. NASA has coordinated multiple space missions and telescopes to study 3I/Atlas, which reached perihelion on October 16, 2025, at a distance of 130 million kilometers from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached on October 16, 2025, 130 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Minimum distance to Earth will be 270 million kilometers on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Speed recorded at about 50 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Observation from eight missions and telescopes, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the Atlas telescope in Chile first detected Comet 3I/Atlas. NASA launched efforts to observe the comet, which included multiple space missions and ground telescopes. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter recorded images of the comet on October 2, when it passed within 32 million kilometers of Mars. The comet reached perihelion on October 16, 2025.</p>

<p>NASA's observations continued until October 16, with various instruments capturing data on the comet's composition and tail. The comet is expected to reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, before leaving the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The rarity of this event allows us to gather unprecedented data from an interstellar object,” said NASA officials, highlighting the significance of the findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is notable for its interstellar origin, indicated by its hyperbolic trajectory. Previous interstellar objects have been observed, but 3I/Atlas provides a unique opportunity to study a comet from outside the solar system, potentially offering insights into the formation of distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring Comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth. Ground-based observatories, including the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, are scheduled to conduct imaging in December to track the comet's trajectory and gather additional data.</p>
