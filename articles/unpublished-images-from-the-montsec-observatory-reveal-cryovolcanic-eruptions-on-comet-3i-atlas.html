      <h2>Unpublished images from the Montsec Observatory reveal cryovolcanic eruptions on comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The Montsec Observatory in Catalunha has captured unprecedented images of cryovolcanic eruptions on comet 3I/ATLAS, which were recorded in October 2025. This comet, the third interstellar object detected crossing the Solar System, was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS astronomical survey in Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it offers insights into the composition of distant celestial bodies and the chemical conditions in other parts of the galaxy. The Spanish scientists' observations suggest a complex and volatile composition for 3I/ATLAS, enhancing our understanding of such interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations at Montsec took place in October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at approximately 221,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, occurred on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units (about 203 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>High-resolution images were captured using the Telescópio Joan Oró.</li>
    <li>The eruptions intensified as the comet approached the Sun, reaching about 378 million kilometers away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. Observations began shortly after its discovery, leading to significant findings in October 2025. The peak activity of the comet was noted during its perihelion on October 29, 2025.</p>
<p>During this period, the Montsec Observatory recorded high-resolution images that revealed the comet's cryovolcanic activity, which was triggered by the sublimation of carbon dioxide as it approached the Sun. This activity provided critical data for researchers analyzing the comet's composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This discovery does not pose any risk of collision with Earth, but it provides crucial data about the chemical conditions present in other corners of the galaxy,” said Prof. Josep M. Trigo-Rodríguez from the Instituto de Ciências Espaciais.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object detected in our Solar System, following Oumuamua and Borisov. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirms its extrasolar origin. The study of such comets offers valuable insights into the materials that form star systems and the processes that shape them.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing analysis of the collected data will continue, with researchers focusing on the implications of the comet's unique composition. Further studies are expected to provide additional insights into the origins and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and similar celestial bodies.</p>
