      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Emits 2.85M-Km Jets, Baffles Astronomers</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS emitting jets of gas and dust measuring 2.85 million kilometres, more than three times the diameter of the Sun. This phenomenon was captured in images taken between 05:08 and 05:22 UT on 9 November 2025, and it has raised questions about the comet's behaviour and characteristics.</p>

<p>The emissions from 3I/ATLAS challenge existing models of cometary physics, prompting scientists to reconsider how such objects operate. Researchers are currently studying the comet's chemical composition and thermal profile to better understand its unique characteristics and the implications for future research in astronomy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS emitted jets measuring 2.85 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Images were captured on 9 November 2025 between 05:08 and 05:22 UT.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth will occur at approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third verified interstellar object, following &#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet is on a hyperbolic orbit and will not return to the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 9 November 2025, astronomers captured images of 3I/ATLAS emitting jets using twin telescopes. The sequence of images, taken over a span of 14 minutes, revealed a sun-facing plume and two anti-tail jets. This observation marked a significant moment in the study of interstellar comets, as the jets have characteristics not previously recorded.</p>

<p>Following the initial observations, independent observatories confirmed the existence of the two opposing anti-tail structures. Researchers have begun further analysis to understand the internal dynamics and properties of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The combination of a giant core, sunward jets, and dual anti-tails has never been observed together before,” said Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb, highlighting the unusual nature of the comet’s emissions.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third verified interstellar object, highlighting its significance in the field of astronomy. Its sustained activity while passing through the Solar System sets it apart from previous interstellar visitors, which exhibited less consistent behaviour.</p>

<p>The comet's unique jets have prompted scientists to explore new avenues in research, including cometary evolution and interstellar chemistry. The ongoing study aims to provide insights into how foreign cosmic materials interact with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it exits the solar system over the coming decades. The ongoing research may lead to revisions of existing models regarding cometary structure and solar interaction, as well as enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
