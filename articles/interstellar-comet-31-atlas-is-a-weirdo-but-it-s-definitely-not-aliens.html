      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is a weirdo, but it’s definitely not aliens</h2>

<p>Scientists have confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, spotted in July, is not an alien spacecraft but rather a unique celestial object. The comet, which originated from another star, was detected 420 million miles from Earth and has since displayed unusual characteristics as it approaches the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers as it provides insights into the composition and behavior of comets from outside our solar system. Observations are ongoing, and scientists continue to analyze its unusual features, including a high ratio of carbon dioxide to water in its coma, which raises questions about its composition and structure.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 by a planetary defense facility.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>It emerged from behind the sun on November 10, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be between 1,450 feet and 3.5 miles long.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is travelling at approximately 137,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Observations have revealed a tail extending at least 35,000 miles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, scientists detected 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third interstellar object discovered. The comet began to approach the sun, prompting further observations. By late August, astronomers utilized the Gemini South telescope in Chile, revealing a large coma and tail. As it continued its trajectory, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the sun on October 30 and re-emerged on November 10, 2023, providing a wealth of data for researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s been spectacular so far,” says Cristina Thomas, a planetary astronomer at Northern Arizona University and one of the comet’s observers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There’s still a lot we don’t know,” states Martin Cordiner, an astrochemist at The Catholic University of America and another 3I/ATLAS tracker.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When we first saw the observations, it was striking. The [carbon dioxide] flux is just incredibly high,” adds Thomas.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a rare class of celestial objects known as interstellar comets. Previous discoveries, such as 2I/Borisov, have provided insights into the materials that exist beyond our solar system. The unusual findings regarding 3I/ATLAS, particularly its high carbon dioxide content, challenge existing models of cometary behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations will continue to shed light on the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Scientists are expected to analyze its composition further as it moves through the inner solar system, and additional data may clarify the peculiarities noted during its approach.</p>
