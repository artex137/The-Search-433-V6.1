      <h2>Mysterious 3I/ATLAS object leads NASA and Harvard to take unprecedented action in space</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has prompted NASA and Harvard University to initiate a significant cooperative monitoring operation, as reported by El Adelantado. Discovered in July 2025 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, the comet has exhibited behavior described as “inexplicable,” leading to the activation of an international alert on October 21, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>The joint effort involves agencies across the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) and directs international observatories to focus on the comet until January 27, 2026. Although NASA has confirmed that Earth is not in danger, the object's unpredictable motion and unique physical features have garnered significant scientific and political interest.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery: July 2025, by ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Speed: Exceeding 209,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately 5 kilometers in diameter</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: No closer than 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Monitoring period: October 21, 2025, to January 27, 2026</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: NASA, Harvard University, IAWN</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third interstellar object identified in our solar system. On October 21, 2025, the Harvard Minor Planet Center issued bulletin MPEC 2025-U142, activating a global space safety protocol. The monitoring operation involves multiple observatories, including NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble.</p>
<p>Despite a U.S. government shutdown, NASA has continued tracking the object with essential personnel. Congress has also expressed interest, with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) calling for the release of unreleased imagery and data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object is most likely a natural comet, but its anomalies imply that we must consider a technological origin because of the large implications to humanity in that case,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The more we learn about 3I/ATLAS, the better we’ll understand how interstellar material moves through our solar system—and how to respond to it safely,” stated a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS's unique characteristics, such as its hyperbolic orbit and anti-tail, distinguish it from other interstellar objects. Previous incidents involving interstellar visitors, like ʻOumuamua, have sparked debates about the potential for artificial origins. The current monitoring operation aims to enhance understanding of interstellar materials and improve planetary defense strategies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa and other agencies plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS through January 27, 2026. Investigations into its composition and behavior will inform future responses to interstellar objects. Briefings for lawmakers regarding the ongoing investigation are also expected despite the government shutdown.</p>
