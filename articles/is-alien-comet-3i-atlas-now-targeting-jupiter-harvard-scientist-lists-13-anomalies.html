      <h2>Is 'alien' comet 3I/ATLAS now targeting Jupiter? Harvard scientist lists 13 anomalies</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was seen streaking through space on November 19 from Italy, may be on a trajectory toward Jupiter, according to Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb. The comet has sparked debate in the scientific community since its discovery on July 1, with Dr. Loeb claiming it could be more than just a natural celestial object.</p>

<p>This assertion has raised questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential intentions. Dr. Loeb has published a list of 13 anomalies related to the comet, suggesting it could release technological devices as artificial satellites of Jupiter. The comet is expected to reach a critical point in its orbit near Jupiter on March 16, 2025, prompting further scrutiny from astronomers and scientists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS spotted on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>It was observed from Italy on November 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb has identified 13 anomalies related to the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya has stated that 3I/ATLAS is a comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2023, and has generated considerable interest and debate within the scientific community. On November 19, the comet was observed from Italy, leading to Dr. Loeb's announcement of 13 anomalies suggesting it might not be a typical comet. The comet is anticipated to reach a significant proximity to Jupiter on March 16, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet and all evidence points to it being a comet,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya. “This is only the third interstellar object like this that humanity has ever found.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object identified as visiting our solar system. The scientific community remains divided over the nature of such objects, with some researchers, like Dr. Loeb, proposing alternative theories. This reflects ongoing debates about the origins and behaviors of interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. Further observations may provide additional insights into the comet's characteristics and any potential anomalies.</p>
