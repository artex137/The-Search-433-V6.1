      <h2>Strange lights in the sky over WA add to deepening mystery</h2>

<p>Strange lights have been sighted across Western Australia’s Midwest, from the coast to hundreds of kilometres inland, on September 10, prompting speculation about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the sightings.</p>

<p>The reports have raised questions among local residents and authorities, with the Perth Observatory receiving multiple claims of unusual lights. The Mid West Ports Authority has suggested the lights may be a result of ship light refraction, while the Perth Observatory has indicated the sightings extend well beyond coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sightings: September 10, 2025</li>
    <li>Locations: Geraldton, Laverton, Mount Magnet, Cue, northern Goldfields</li>
    <li>Distance from Perth: 420 kilometres north to inland areas</li>
    <li>Authorities involved: Perth Observatory, Mid West Ports Authority, Department of Defence</li>
    <li>No military activities confirmed in the area on the night of sightings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 10, Shane and Bradley Plane observed three or four lights while driving near Point Moore in Geraldton. They reported that the lights appeared to move in various formations. The Perth Observatory received numerous reports of similar sightings across a wide area, including as far inland as Laverton. Matt Woods, a spokesperson for the observatory, noted the unusual spread and number of sightings.</p>

<p>The Department of Defence later confirmed there were no military exercises in the region at that time. Heathcliff Pimento, harbour master at Mid West Ports Authority, proposed that atmospheric refraction could explain the lights, suggesting that layers of warm and cool air could distort ship lights. However, Woods expressed skepticism about this explanation, citing the widespread visibility of the lights.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We were driving towards the lighthouse and I said to Brad, ‘See that star up there? It's not looking right,’” said Shane Plane.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Is there something being tested? A company trialling drones, or something new being worked on? It will be very interesting to find out what it is,” said Matt Woods, spokesperson for Perth Observatory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“You'd see the lights but the object itself isn't actually there,” said Heathcliff Pimento, suggesting the lights could be atmospheric mirages.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Lights of this nature are often referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). NASA defines UAP as observations of objects or events in the sky that cannot be identified or confirmed through scientific methods. The current reports contribute to a growing interest in aerial phenomena in various regions, with many seeking explanations for such sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to investigate the reports of strange lights, with the Perth Observatory monitoring for further sightings and analyzing data to determine the cause of the phenomena. Further updates are anticipated as more information becomes available.</p>
