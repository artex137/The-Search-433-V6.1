      <h2>New November 16 Image Shows 3I/ATLAS Behaving in Ways No Natural Comet Should</h2>

<p>A new image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured on November 16, 2025, by the Canary One 0.5-meter telescope, reveals unusual behaviors that challenge existing theories of cometary physics. The image shows a nucleus exhibiting unexpected patterns in dust and jet formations, raising significant questions about the comet's nature and behavior as it approaches Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it may influence scientific understanding of interstellar objects and their dynamics. Researchers are analyzing the image to gain insights into the comet's structure and behavior as it nears its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Observatories worldwide have begun new observation efforts to gather additional data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: November 16, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of telescope: Canary One</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Current observations: Ongoing at ground telescopes worldwide</li>
    <li>NASA's HiRISE images: Not yet released</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 16, 2025, the Canary One telescope captured an image of 3I/ATLAS, revealing strange behaviors in its dust and jet patterns. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Scientists have noted that 3I/ATLAS has exhibited non-gravitational acceleration and other anomalies since entering the solar system.</p>

<p>Following the image capture, researchers began analyzing the data to better understand the comet's unusual behavior. The scientific community is calling for the release of NASA's HiRISE images, which have not been disclosed despite increasing demand.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “When an interstellar object refuses to conform to natural expectations, we must remain open to all explanations grounded in evidence.” — Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has already defied conventional cometary behavior since its arrival in the solar system. Its non-gravitational acceleration and unusual jet structures have prompted scientists to revisit established models. Previous observations indicated the comet brightened dramatically near perihelion, leading to speculation about potential disintegration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As ground telescopes continue to observe 3I/ATLAS, scientists hope to clarify the comet's mysteries. The next few weeks will be critical for gathering data, especially as researchers await the release of NASA's critical images.</p>
