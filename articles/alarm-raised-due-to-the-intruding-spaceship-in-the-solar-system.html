      <h2>Alarm Raised Due to the Intruding 'Spaceship' in the Solar System</h2>

<p>A new anomaly surrounding comet 3I/ATLAS has been reported, raising concerns among astronomers. The detection was made public by astronomer Avi Loeb on his blog on Medium. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this discovery.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges current understandings of comet formation and behavior. Authorities and astronomers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS, which is on a trajectory towards the Jupiter system. The comet has been identified as the third interstellar object discovered in the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected anomaly in the cloud surrounding comet 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Astronomer Avi Loeb reported the findings on Medium.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to have a core diameter of up to 20 kilometers.</li>
    <li>It was first reported in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is heading towards the Jupiter system.</li>
    <li>It is composed of relatively large dust particles, lacking a typical comet tail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers first reported the presence of 3I/ATLAS within the orbit of Jupiter. Since then, observations have indicated that the comet is not behaving like typical comets, leading to the recent analysis by Avi Loeb.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb noted the absence of microscopic dust particles that would typically enhance the comet's blue color through Rayleigh scattering. Instead, he highlighted that the cloud surrounding 3I/ATLAS consists of larger dust particles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Notably, there is an absence of traces of microscopic dust particles that would enhance the blue color through Rayleigh scattering,” said Avi Loeb in his report.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered in the Solar System, following previous discoveries that have prompted further investigation into the nature of such celestial bodies. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS contribute to a growing body of research on interstellar objects and their origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Jupiter system, with further studies planned to investigate its composition and behavior.</p>
