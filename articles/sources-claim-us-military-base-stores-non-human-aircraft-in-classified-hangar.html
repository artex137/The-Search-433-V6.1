      <h2>Sources Claim US Military Base Stores 'Non Human' Aircraft in Classified Hangar</h2>

<p>Speculation about unidentified flying objects has resurfaced in the United States following claims that the Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland may store aircraft of 'non-human' origin in a classified hangar. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these claims.</p>

<p>The allegations have prompted renewed interest in the Pentagon's ongoing investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena. While the Pentagon has denied possessing physical evidence of extraterrestrial technology, former intelligence officials and unnamed sources have suggested otherwise, igniting public curiosity and debate.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland</li>
    <li>Claims of 'non-human' aircraft stored in a classified hangar</li>
    <li>Allegations date back to the 1950s</li>
    <li>Former Pentagon intelligence official Luis Elizondo testified before Congress regarding covert programmes</li>
    <li>Incursions by at least two types of aircraft, including unidentified flying objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Speculation about the existence of 'non-human' aircraft has circulated for decades, with renewed focus following testimony from Luis Elizondo in recent months. Elizondo claimed that the U.S. government has maintained covert programmes aimed at recovering and analyzing such craft.</p>

<p>According to reports, anonymous sources close to the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) claim that an 'exotic vehicle of unknown origin' has been housed in a secure hangar at Patuxent River for decades. These sources allege that monitoring activities have occurred at the base, including incursions by Chinese surveillance drones and other unidentified flying objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “These facilities included locations in the Las Vegas area and a newly built hangar at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station ('PAX'). Specifically, the PAX River hangar was designed to facilitate the transfer of future materials via air and river.” 
    — Luis Elizondo, former Pentagon intelligence official
</blockquote>

<p>While Elizondo has provided testimony suggesting the existence of reverse-engineered craft, some anonymous sources dispute his claims, asserting that no new hangars were constructed at the base following directives from the former CIA director of science and technology.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The U.S. military has consistently denied any recorded physical evidence of UFOs. However, former government employees and scientists have raised concerns that significant information remains withheld from the public. The claims surrounding Patuxent River reflect a broader pattern in UFO discussions, characterized by anonymous sources and dramatic assertions without tangible proof.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into these claims continue, with no official timeline for when further information may be released. The Pentagon faces ongoing scrutiny regarding its transparency on unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
