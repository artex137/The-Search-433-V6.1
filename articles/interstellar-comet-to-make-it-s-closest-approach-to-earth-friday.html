      <h2>Interstellar comet to make its closest approach to Earth Friday</h2>

<p>This Friday, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest pass to Earth, allowing astronomers to study an object that formed beyond our solar system. The comet is expected to remain hundreds of millions of miles away, posing no threat to the planet.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the unique origin of 3I/ATLAS. Unlike typical comets, which form around the Sun, this comet originated from another star and is now on a one-way trajectory through our solar system. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are actively tracking its progress using various telescopes and missions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Closest Approach:</strong> December 18, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Hundreds of millions of miles</li>
    <li><strong>Tracking Agencies:</strong> NASA, ESA, Hubble Space Telescope, JUICE probe</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Not visible to the naked eye; telescopes required</li>
    <li><strong>Live Stream:</strong> Available through the Virtual Telescope Project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered as it entered our solar system, marking it as the third known interstellar comet. Since its discovery, astronomers have monitored its trajectory and behavior as it approaches Earth.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2025, the comet will reach its closest point to Earth, allowing for extensive observations by both professional and amateur astronomers. After this date, 3I/ATLAS will continue on its path and exit the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Scientists are interested in rare objects like this because they allow comparisons between material formed around other stars and the building blocks of our own solar system,” said a representative from NASA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins the ranks of other interstellar comets, providing a rare opportunity for study. Previous interstellar comets have offered insights into the composition and formation of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After the closest approach, astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it leaves the solar system, collecting data that may enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
