      <h2>It may be a serial killer — Harvard scientist sows doubt about 3I/ATLAS comet while NASA confirms natural origin</h2>

<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the comet’s potential dangers, labeling it a "serial killer" that could be "spreading poison." This statement contrasts with findings from NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which confirm the comet's natural origin.</p>

<p>The conflicting views on the 3I/ATLAS comet underscore the ongoing debate in the astronomical community. NASA has reported that the comet has a natural origin and has released significant scientific observations. Meanwhile, Loeb's assertions have sparked public interest and speculation regarding the comet's chemical properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to approach Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed the comet's natural origin based on recent observations.</li>
    <li>JAXA's XRISM observatory captured a 400,000-kilometer X-ray halo surrounding the comet.</li>
    <li>Observations show spectral excesses in carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen from the comet's gas plume.</li>
    <li>Loeb argues the comet has a high ratio of methanol to hydrogen cyanide, raising safety concerns.</li>
    <li>NASA, ESA, and JAXA scientists disagree with Loeb's theories, citing common features in comets.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits a "heartbeat" brightness change every 16 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between November 26 and November 28, NASA and JAXA conducted observations of the 3I/ATLAS comet. They noted a significant X-ray halo and identified chemical components in the comet's gas plume. Following these findings, Loeb made his controversial statements regarding the comet's potential dangers and its unusual chemical profile.</p>

<p>As December 19 approaches, the comet's visibility and the scientific community's divided opinions continue to attract attention. The public remains engaged with both the scientific narrative and Loeb's speculative theories.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The halo is evidence of a large comet interacting with its environment,” said NASA scientists.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The plume complexity is a common feature of dynamically active comets,” added ESA and JAXA mission scientists.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS could be the ‘seed of life’ or a ‘serial killer,’” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet is notable as it is one of only three interstellar comets ever observed. Previous studies of interstellar objects have provided insight into the material chemistry of planetary systems. The unique properties of this comet have led to increased interest from both scientists and the public.</p>

<p>While Loeb's claims have generated intrigue, they lack support from the broader scientific community, which relies on established research and data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations from ESA’s Juice mission and the James Webb Space Telescope are expected to provide additional clarity on the comet's characteristics and behavior in the coming year. For now, the scientific community continues to monitor the 3I/ATLAS comet as it approaches Earth.</p>
