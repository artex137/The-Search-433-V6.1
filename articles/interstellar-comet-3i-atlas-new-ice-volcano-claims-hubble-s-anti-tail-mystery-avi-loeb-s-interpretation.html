      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: New ‘Ice Volcano’ Claims, Hubble’s Anti-Tail Mystery & Avi Loeb’s Interpretation</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn renewed scientific interest following recent observations that suggest unusual features and potential cryovolcanic activity. Observations from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and ESA’s JUICE spacecraft have raised questions about the comet's behavior since its perihelion on October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it may provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects and their behavior. Leading astrophysicists, including Avi Loeb, are analyzing the latest data to understand the comet’s characteristics and the implications for future observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed by NASA’s Hubble Telescope on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently located approximately 286 million km from Earth.</li>
    <li>It is expected to be visible near the star Regulus in mid-December.</li>
    <li>The comet has a brightness of around magnitude 12 as of December 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is officially designated C/2025 N1 and was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of the comet is estimated to be less than 1 km in size.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Chile. It traveled from interstellar space at a speed of approximately 58 km/s. The comet passed perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 AU from the Sun. Observations made on November 30 revealed a teardrop-shaped inner coma and a 60,000 km-long anti-tail.</p>
<p>On December 5, 2025, the comet was reported to be 286 million km from Earth, continuing its journey towards the constellation Leo.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The heating of CO₂ ice might trigger chemical reactions strong enough to power ‘ice volcano’ eruptions,” said Josep M. Trigo-Rodríguez, lead author of a preprint research paper discussing the potential cryovolcanism of the comet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb noted that the Hubble image aligns with his predictions, suggesting that non-gravitational acceleration has led to the detachment of macroscopic objects from the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following ʻOumuamua and Borisov. Its unique characteristics may provide valuable data on the composition and behavior of interstellar comets, which are still not fully understood.</p>
<p>Prior observations of interstellar objects have shown varying features, and the ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS may help clarify the phenomena associated with such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations will involve additional observations using Hubble, JWST, and JUICE to determine whether the observed features are indicative of cryovolcanoes or standard cometary outgassing. The scientific community awaits peer review of the findings related to the comet's activity.</p>
