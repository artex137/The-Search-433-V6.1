      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-28 09:47 UTC</p>

      <h2>As 3I/ATLAS Re-Emerges From Behind The Sun, NASA’s Activation of Its Planetary Defense Plan Comes Into Focus</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense plan as interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS re-emerges from behind the Sun, with perihelion expected around October 29-30, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The re-emergence of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks the first clean observation of the comet since it was discovered on July 1, 2025. NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office is implementing its broader Strategy for Planetary Defense, which includes detection, characterization, and potential mitigation of celestial objects. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) is coordinating a community astrometry campaign focused on 3I/ATLAS, highlighting the importance of this observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is expected around October 29-30, 2025, at approximately 1.4 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The IAWN has initiated a community astrometry campaign targeting 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Nasa's NEO Surveyor is slated to launch no earlier than 2027.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered as the third confirmed interstellar visitor. Following this, the comet began its journey through the inner solar system. As the comet approaches perihelion, NASA has activated its planetary defense strategy to monitor and analyze the comet's behavior.</p>

<p>As of October 29-30, 2025, the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun, allowing astronomers to gather critical data about its trajectory and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What you’re seeing is that plan operating in real-time: targeted observing campaigns, and cross-agency coordination,” said a spokesperson from NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS behaves like a normal comet, that’s a win for understanding the stuff between the stars,” added the spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The activation of NASA's planetary defense plan is part of a broader national strategy to prepare for near-Earth object hazards. The plan includes detection systems and potential mitigation strategies, as demonstrated by the recent DART mission. Previous incidents have underscored the necessity of such preparedness in the event of a threatening celestial object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the re-emergence of 3I/ATLAS, analysts will compare observed velocities with model predictions. The IAWN will conduct a comet astrometry campaign from November 2025 to January 2026 to refine the comet's orbit and behavior.</p>
