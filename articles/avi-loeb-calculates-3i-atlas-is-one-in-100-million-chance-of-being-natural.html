      <h2>Avi Loeb Calculates 3I/ATLAS is One in 100 Million Chance of Being Natural</h2>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has determined that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a probability of just one in 100 million of being a natural object, based on his recent analysis of its characteristics. His findings were discussed in a piece published on Medium, following the release of a detailed photograph of the comet taken on 9 November 2025.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it challenges existing models of comet behaviour and raises questions about the nature of interstellar objects. The British Astronomical Association (BAA) shared an image of 3I/ATLAS, taken by Frank Niebling and Michael Buchner, which prompted Loeb's scrutiny of its unusual features.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was photographed on 9 November 2025 between 5:08 and 5:22 UT.</li>
    <li>The object is currently 326 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, at a distance of 269 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Loeb estimates the mass of 3I/ATLAS at 33 billion tonnes.</li>
    <li>The diameter of 3I/ATLAS is calculated to be greater than five kilometres.</li>
    <li>The mass loss rate from the comet's outflows is estimated at 50 billion tonnes per month.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 9 November 2025, Frank Niebling and Michael Buchner captured a wide-field image of 3I/ATLAS using two telescopes. The image revealed two anti-tail streaks and a longer outflow, prompting further analysis by Avi Loeb. Loeb's calculations suggest that the probability of 3I/ATLAS being a natural comet is exceedingly low, raising questions about its origins.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is anticipated to reach its closest point to Earth on 19 December 2025, followed by observations from NASA's Juno spacecraft on 16 March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Assuming a solid density of 0.5 grams per cubic centimetre, this mass estimate implies that the diameter of 3I/ATLAS has to be greater than five kilometres.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We would expect an object with a diameter above 10 kilometres to be delivered to our vicinity once per ten thousand years or longer,” Loeb noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's analysis of 3I/ATLAS follows his previous work on other interstellar objects, such as 1I/'Oumuamua. His findings indicate that 3I/ATLAS's mass and size are significantly greater than what is typically observed in interstellar objects, leading to questions about the nature and frequency of such occurrences.</p>

<p>The implications of this research could reshape our understanding of interstellar objects and their behaviours as they interact with our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations of 3I/ATLAS are planned using the Hubble and Webb telescopes. These observations will further investigate the comet's unusual characteristics and assess its trajectory as it approaches Earth.</p>
