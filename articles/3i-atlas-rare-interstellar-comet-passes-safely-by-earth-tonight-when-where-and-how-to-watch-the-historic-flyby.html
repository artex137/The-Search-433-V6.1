      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Rare interstellar comet passes safely by Earth tonight</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is making its closest approach to Earth tonight, 19 December, drawing attention from astronomers worldwide. The comet, discovered on 1 July by NASA-funded ATLAS telescopes in Chile, is only the third interstellar visitor ever seen by scientists. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to the event.</p>

<p>This flyby is significant for scientists, as it provides a rare opportunity to study the dust and gas released from the comet as it heats up near the Sun. According to the European Space Agency, 3I/ATLAS will not come closer than about 1.8 astronomical units from Earth, which is nearly twice the average distance between Earth and the Sun, or about 168 million miles (270 million kilometres). Scientists have confirmed that the comet poses no danger to Earth or any other planets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Closest Approach:</strong> 19 December 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 1.8 astronomical units (168 million miles / 270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Visitors:</strong> 1I/‘Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream Start Time:</strong> 4 am UTC on 20 December 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2023 by ATLAS telescopes in Chile. Shortly after its discovery, scientists confirmed that the comet's unusual speed and trajectory indicated it originated from outside the solar system. Tonight, it makes its closest approach to Earth, which offers astronomers a unique opportunity to study its composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS are like space messengers. They bring clues from faraway parts of the universe into our cosmic neighborhood,” a representative from Space.com stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The occurrence of interstellar comets is rare, with only two others identified before 3I/ATLAS. These comets provide valuable insights into the formation of celestial bodies and the processes that shape solar systems. The study of such objects is crucial for understanding the broader universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After tonight’s flyby, 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey around the Sun and eventually exit the solar system. Astronomers will analyze data collected during the close approach to gain insights into its composition and behavior.</p>
