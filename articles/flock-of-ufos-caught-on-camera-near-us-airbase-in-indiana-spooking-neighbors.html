      <h2>Flock of UFOs caught on camera near US airbase in Indiana, spooking neighbors</h2>

<p>A flock of glowing UFOs has been spotted near the Grissom Joint Air Reserve Base in Indiana, causing alarm among local residents on October 7. At least six yellowish-orange orbs were captured on video flickering and hovering in the sky near Kokomo before disappearing, according to reports and eyewitness accounts.</p>

<p>This sighting has drawn attention to the phenomenon of unidentified flying objects, particularly near military installations. Authorities have not provided an explanation for the lights, which have sparked both fascination and concern among witnesses. The US Air Force has not responded to inquiries about the incident as of Friday.</p>
