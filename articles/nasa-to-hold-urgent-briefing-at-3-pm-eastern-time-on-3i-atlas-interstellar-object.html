      <h2>NASA To Hold Urgent Briefing At 3 PM Eastern Time On 3I/Atlas Interstellar Object</h2>

<p>NASA has scheduled an urgent briefing for November 19 at 3 PM Eastern Time to provide updates on the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS. The event will occur at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This briefing is significant as the comet, currently approaching Earth after passing the Sun, has sparked debate regarding its origins. NASA plans to share new images of 3I/ATLAS, which is only the third object recorded to travel through our solar system from outside our galaxy. The comet's characteristics have raised questions among astronomers and officials, particularly regarding potential alien origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date and Time:</strong> November 19, at 3 PM Eastern Time</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> 170 million miles from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Participants:</strong> NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, Nicky Fox, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, Tom Statler</li>
    <li><strong>Broadcast:</strong> NASA+, NASA app, agency website, YouTube channel, Amazon Prime</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been traveling through our solar system after rounding the Sun. Recent findings by astronomers David Jewitt and Jane Luu confirm that the comet's body is intact and surrounded by a glowing coma of gas. The comet's unique characteristics have led to various speculations about its nature.</p>
<p>On November 19, NASA will host a live event to present new imagery of the comet. Officials have stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Technological thrusters which point their exhaust towards the sun would accelerate away from the Sun,” said Professor Avi Loeb, referencing the unique gas plume of 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I do believe it’s a passing through comet, and so I don’t think we are going to have any contact with any non-human intelligence yet,” said US Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, expressing concerns about withheld information.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS highlights ongoing discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial life and the transparency of information from government agencies. The comet’s unique characteristics have drawn attention not only from the scientific community but also from politicians and the public alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the solar system. The agency will provide further updates following the briefing on November 19.</p>
