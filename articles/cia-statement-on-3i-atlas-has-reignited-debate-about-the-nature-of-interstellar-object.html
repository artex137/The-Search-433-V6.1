      <p class="byline">Published 2026-01-07 03:48 UTC</p>

      <h2>CIA statement on 3I/ATLAS has reignited debate about the nature of interstellar object</h2>

<p>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has responded to a November 2025 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, stating it can "neither deny nor confirm the existence or nonexistence of such records." This response has raised new questions regarding the nature of the object, which NASA has described as a comet from another world.</p>

<p>The CIA's classification of information related to 3I/ATLAS has sparked renewed debate among scientists and the public. NASA has consistently maintained that the object shows no signs of alien life and is not an artificially constructed spacecraft. However, the CIA’s response suggests there may be undisclosed information that could be sensitive, prompting discussions about the implications of such secrecy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The CIA has classified information regarding 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The agency responded to a FOIA request made in November 2025.</li>
    <li>Nasa has stated that 3I/ATLAS is a comet of natural origin.</li>
    <li>No evidence has been presented to support claims of 3I/ATLAS being an alien spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has questioned the CIA's classification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2025, a FOIA request was submitted to the CIA regarding 3I/ATLAS. The CIA's response indicated that information about the object is classified, leading to renewed public interest and debate over its nature.</p>

<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA officials held a press conference asserting that 3I/ATLAS is definitively a comet of natural origin, contradicting other claims about its potential alien origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself currently and properly classified and is intelligence sources and methods information protected from disclosure,” the CIA stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That this information is treated as sensitive enough to be classified by the CIA is surprising, given that NASA officials stated decisively at a press conference on November 19, 2025, that 3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS is not new. Previous discussions about interstellar objects have often included speculation about their origins and potential threats. NASA has consistently provided reassurances about the nature of such objects, while the CIA's classification of information raises concerns about transparency.</p>

<p>Loeb's comments reflect a broader skepticism about the implications of government secrecy in scientific matters, particularly when it involves potential threats to society.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no announced investigations or further actions planned regarding 3I/ATLAS. The CIA's classification may prevent further disclosures, leaving the public and scientific community awaiting more definitive information.</p>
