      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS accelerates at 57 km/s on a hyperbolic path and reveals interstellar origins</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025, has reached a speed of 57 km/s during its perihelion on October 30. The comet is now on a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it will exit the Solar System permanently. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object identified in the Solar System, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Teams from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have been monitoring the comet since its detection by the ATLAS program in Hawaii. The comet’s origins from outside the Solar System highlight the rarity of such events.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Reached a speed of 57 km/s during perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Monitored by NASA and ESA since detection.</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of a few kilometers.</li>
    <li>Passed Mars at a distance of 19 million miles in September 2025.</li>
    <li>Identified compounds include water, carbon dioxide, and methane.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered by the ATLAS program in Hawaii.</p>
<p>September 2025: The comet passes Mars at a distance of 19 million miles.</p>
<p>October 30, 2025: 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion, accelerating to 57 km/s.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The hyperbolic trajectory means that 3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System due to the gravitational influence of neighboring stars,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Observations indicate an estimated diameter of a few kilometers, with gas ejections driven by solar heating,” noted an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects had been confirmed: Oumuamua and Borisov. These discoveries have prompted increased interest in the study of interstellar visitors and their potential implications for understanding the formation of planetary systems.</p>
<p>The analysis of 3I/ATLAS may offer insights into the diversity of elements found on exoplanets, as comparisons with Borisov highlight differences in elemental abundance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>International teams plan additional observations of 3I/ATLAS until it exits telescopic range. Future missions may incorporate insights gained from studying this comet to enhance detection capabilities for interstellar visitors.</p>
