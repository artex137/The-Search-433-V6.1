      <h2>No, it wasn’t UFOs: Here’s what you saw in the sky this morning</h2>

<p>Residents across Southwest Florida observed a SpaceX launch from Cape Canaveral on Sunday morning, September 21, 2025, just before 7 a.m. The launch sent 28 Starlink satellites into orbit, with no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it contributes to SpaceX's ongoing efforts to expand internet access through its satellite network. Authorities have confirmed that the launch was visible from various locations in Southwest Florida, prompting residents to share images and videos of the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Launch occurred at approximately 7 a.m. on September 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>28 Starlink satellites were deployed into Earth's lower orbit.</li>
    <li>Launch site: Cape Canaveral, located 246 miles from Fort Myers.</li>
    <li>Clear skies provided optimal viewing conditions across Southwest Florida.</li>
    <li>Over 6,000 satellites are now in orbit as part of the Starlink program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At around 7 a.m., SpaceX launched a batch of 28 Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral. The launch was clearly visible from Southwest Florida due to favorable weather conditions, including minimal cloud cover and dry air.</p>
<p>Residents began sharing their observations shortly after the launch, with many describing the sight as resembling a “jellyfish” in the sky as the rocket’s exhaust interacted with the rising sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “WINK News viewers and Weather Watchers sent their pictures and videos to Weather Authority Meteorologist Lauren Kreidler, wondering what they saw in the sky,” said Kreidler.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This launch is part of SpaceX's ongoing efforts to enhance global internet coverage through its Starlink satellite network. With over 6,000 satellites already in orbit, the program aims to provide high-speed internet access to areas lacking traditional broadband services.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>SpaceX plans to continue its satellite launches, with future missions scheduled to expand its network and improve service availability. Local weather conditions will be monitored as moisture returns to the region, potentially impacting visibility for subsequent launches.</p>
