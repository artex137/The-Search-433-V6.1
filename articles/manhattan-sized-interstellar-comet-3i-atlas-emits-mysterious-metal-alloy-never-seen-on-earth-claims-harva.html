      <h2>Manhattan-sized interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS emits mysterious metal alloy never seen on Earth, claims Harvard</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, approximately the size of Manhattan at 5.6 kilometres in diameter, has been emitting a metal alloy never before observed in nature, according to Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb. First detected in July 2023, the comet weighs about 33 billion tons and was photographed by the Hubble Telescope on July 21.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about comet composition. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat and will pass safely. Recent images from the Keck II telescope in Hawaii have revealed that the comet is emitting a plume containing four grams of nickel per second, with no evidence of iron, which is unusual for comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 5.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet weighs about 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>First detected in July 2023 and photographed by Hubble on July 21.</li>
    <li>Recent images from Keck II telescope show a plume emitting four grams of nickel per second.</li>
    <li>No evidence of iron has been found in the comet's emissions.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023. It was photographed by the Hubble Telescope on July 21. In August, new images captured by the Keck II telescope revealed the comet's unusual emissions. The American Astronomical Society reported the presence of a gas jet directed toward the Sun, which is atypical for comets.</p>

<p>Between October 4 and 7, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS as it passed within 12 million miles of Mars. However, these images are currently not available to the public due to a government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is only one place where that is known to exist and that is in industrially produced nickel alloys,” Dr. Avi Loeb said. “This was never observed for any other object.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Why are we seeing a jet pointed at the Sun? A stream of material in the direction of the Sun?” Loeb questioned regarding the comet's unusual behavior.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In previous studies of comets, including the two previous interstellar comets, nickel and iron have appeared in comparable amounts. The refined compound observed in 3I/ATLAS is typically used in metal coatings in manufacturing, particularly in the aerospace industry. The lack of iron and the presence of nickel tetracarbonyl have raised questions about the comet's origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations continue, scientists are awaiting the release of images from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Dr. Loeb has suggested that the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS may indicate a non-natural origin, prompting further scrutiny and speculation within the scientific community.</p>
