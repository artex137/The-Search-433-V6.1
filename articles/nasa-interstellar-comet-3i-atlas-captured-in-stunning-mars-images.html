      <h2>NASA Interstellar Comet 3I ATLAS Captured in Stunning Mars Images</h2>

<p>NASA has photographed Interstellar Comet 3I ATLAS as it passed near Mars, marking a significant achievement in planetary science. The images were taken by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and provide insight into the comet’s composition and trajectory.</p>

<p>This discovery is crucial for understanding interstellar objects and their origins. NASA scientists view the event as an opportunity to study materials from outside our solar system, which could reshape knowledge about planetary formation and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS was photographed by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at an estimated speed of over 160,900 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>This is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet shows a faint, glowing trail in the captured images.</li>
    <li>Scientists believe it originated from a young star system in the Carina–Sagittarius arm of the Milky Way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The images of Comet 3I ATLAS were taken recently by the MRO using its HiRISE camera. The comet's detection adds to the growing body of knowledge surrounding interstellar objects. Early analysis indicates its composition includes icy materials and organic molecules.</p>

<p>In the past, astronomers have confirmed only two other interstellar visitors, making the study of Comet 3I ATLAS a rare opportunity for scientists. The data collected could influence future space missions aimed at intercepting similar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Studying NASA Interstellar Comet 3I ATLAS gives us the opportunity to understand the materials and chemical compositions of regions far outside our solar neighborhood,” said Dr. Amy Mainzer, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is one of the most pristine samples of interstellar material we’ve ever seen,” stated Dr. Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii. “The data from NASA Interstellar Comet 3I ATLAS could reshape how we think about the formation of planetary systems and the potential for life elsewhere in the universe.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar comets is rare, with only two others confirmed before 3I ATLAS. Each new observation aids in understanding the dynamic processes of the universe and the origins of celestial bodies. Such studies have implications for the search for extraterrestrial life and the evolution of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are exploring the possibility of developing robotic probes to intercept and sample similar interstellar objects in the future. This research could provide further insights into the origins of water and organic molecules in the universe.</p>
