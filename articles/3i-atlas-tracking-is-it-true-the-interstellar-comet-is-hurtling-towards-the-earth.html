      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-03 13:54 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS tracking: Is the interstellar comet hurtling towards Earth?</h2>

<p>Rumors have circulated on social media about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS potentially heading towards Earth, causing widespread panic. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have confirmed that the comet poses no threat, and instead, it offers a unique opportunity for scientific study.</p>

<p>This situation has sparked concern due to the viral nature of misinformation online. Authorities, including NASA and ESA, have been working to clarify the comet's trajectory and its significance to science.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by NASA's ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at approximately 210,000 km/h (130,500 mph), the fastest speed recorded for an object in space.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth occurred on July 21, 2025, at a distance of about 270 million kilometers (167.8 million miles).</li>
    <li>The comet will reach perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 30, 2025, still over 210 million km away from Earth.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Mars orbiters will observe the comet between October 1 and 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Psyche mission will collect data as it travels towards the asteroid 16 Psyche.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The online frenzy began after a story was published by the New York Post on September 29, 2025, claiming the comet could be an alien spacecraft. This was followed by various social media posts that amplified the narrative, including one by user Steven Greenstreet.</p>

<p>NASA confirmed the comet's discovery on July 1, 2025, and reported its closest approach to Earth on July 21, 2025. The ESA and NASA have since clarified that the comet does not threaten Earth and is an opportunity for scientific investigation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is not a doomsday threat; it is a one-of-a-kind opportunity for science,” said T. Marshall Eubanks, Chief Scientist at Space Initiatives Inc.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time misinformation about celestial events has caused public concern. Previous incidents involving comets and asteroids have led to speculation about potential impacts on Earth. The scientific community has stressed the importance of accurate information to mitigate public fear.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. Observations will focus on determining its composition and understanding its origins, contributing to ongoing research about interstellar objects.</p>
