      <h2>UFO 'spotted' in Ireland as three orange lights in 'perfect triangle' reported</h2>

<p>In 2025, police in Northern Ireland received multiple reports of three orange lights forming a "perfect triangle" in the sky. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) confirmed they received three UFO-related reports, but none involved extraterrestrial beings. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The reports have raised interest in UFO sightings in the region. The PSNI stated that all reports were noted for information only, with no ongoing investigations or lines of inquiry identified. Authorities are not collaborating with other organizations regarding these sightings at this time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reports received by PSNI in 2025.</li>
    <li>Three UFO-related reports confirmed.</li>
    <li>Locations include Abbey Park in Armagh, Cypress Park in East Belfast, and Norwood Court in Coleraine.</li>
    <li>No ongoing investigations or lines of inquiry identified by PSNI.</li>
    <li>UFO sightings fluctuated from four in 2019 to none reported from January 1 to November 1, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2025, the PSNI received three reports of UFO sightings. The first report came from Abbey Park in Armagh, where a caller described three orange lights in a triangular formation. The second report originated from Cypress Park, likely referring to Cyprus Park in East Belfast, mentioning a UFO above the airport/docks. The third report was an emergency call from Norwood Court in Coleraine, which abruptly ended.</p>

<p>The PSNI confirmed that these reports were categorized as UFO-related but explicitly stated that there were no indications of extraterrestrial involvement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There was nothing ongoing and no lines of inquiry were identified at the time of the call,” a PSNI spokesperson said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“PSNI works in partnership with others as and when circumstances require,” the spokesperson added when asked about collaboration on UFO reports.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The number of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland has varied over the past five years, with a notable drop in reports in 2023. The Ministry of Defence previously tracked UFO sightings but closed its UFO desk in 2009, concluding that no report had ever revealed evidence of a potential threat. Nick Pope, a former investigator for the MoD, has suggested that the low numbers could be due to public reluctance to report sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for further investigations into these sightings. The PSNI continues to monitor reports but has no ongoing inquiries at this time.</p>
