      <h2>New Image of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Surprises Scientists</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have surprised scientists from the European Space Agency (ESA) as the agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) team observed the comet on November 2, 2023. The images show a clearly visible comet surrounded by signs of activity, including a glowing halo of gas, known as its coma.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever spotted, according to the ESA. The recent images have reignited debate among scientists regarding the comet's characteristics, particularly concerning claims made by Harvard professor Abraham "Avi" Loeb, who suggests the comet exhibits abnormalities that imply it is not a natural object. The ESA maintains that the comet is simply an interstellar object, which is still a noteworthy find.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images captured by ESA's JUICE on November 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the comet occurred on November 4, 2023, at a distance of approximately 66 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2023, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>NASA has determined that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The ESA expects to receive more data from observations on February 18 and 20, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2023, approximately 670 million kilometers from Earth. The comet was officially named 3I/ATLAS shortly after its discovery.</p>
<p>On November 2, 2023, ESA's JUICE captured images of the comet, showing signs of activity, including a glowing halo of gas and hints of two tails. The closest approach to the comet occurred on November 4, 2023, at a distance of around 66 million kilometers.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “These latest images show a glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet,” the ESA stated. “The images also show a hint of two tails—the plasma tail and the dust tail.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The gas plume around the comet has been a key point of contention,” Professor Abraham Loeb said. He has previously mentioned abnormalities in the gas plume, which experts have disputed.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Before 3I/ATLAS, two other interstellar objects were discovered—1I/`Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing interest in interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>
<p>The debate surrounding the nature of 3I/ATLAS highlights ongoing discussions in the scientific community about the classification of such objects and their implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the recent observations, the ESA plans to analyze the data collected and expects to receive more information from instruments activated during the observations on February 18 and 20, 2026. 3I/ATLAS will also reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>
