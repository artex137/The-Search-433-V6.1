      <h2>Nasa releases new images of mysterious Comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>Nasa has released new close-up images of Comet 3I/Atlas, which is currently touring our solar system and is expected to leave permanently. The comet was first spotted over the summer and is only the third known object to have entered the solar system from another star's orbit.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the characteristics of interstellar objects. Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA) have deployed several spacecraft to observe the comet while astronomers use ground telescopes to study it. The comet is currently approximately 190 million miles (307 million kilometers) from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/Atlas is about 190 million miles (307 million kilometers) from Earth.</li>
<li>It will make its closest approach to Earth at 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) in mid-December.</li>
<li>The comet is believed to measure between 1,444 feet (440 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) across.</li>
<li>Observations have been made by Nasa spacecraft and ESA satellites around Mars.</li>
<li>The European Space Agency's Juice spacecraft is monitoring the comet while en route to Jupiter.</li>
<li>Data from Juice will not be available until February.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was first spotted over the summer as it entered the solar system. Nasa and ESA have since focused their observational efforts on the comet, particularly after its closest pass to the sun. Currently, ground telescopes have also been aimed at the comet as it approaches Earth.</p>

<p>As the comet moves closer, it is expected to reach its nearest point to Earth in mid-December, after which it will continue its journey back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All of its characteristics are explained by it being a natural phenomenon,” Nasa officials stated regarding speculation about the comet being an alien spacecraft.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is notable as it is only the third object recorded entering our solar system from another star. Observations of such interstellar comets can enhance our understanding of the materials and conditions present outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor Comet 3I/Atlas until its closest approach in December. Observational data from the ESA's Juice spacecraft will be analyzed once available in February, providing further insights into this interstellar visitor.</p>
