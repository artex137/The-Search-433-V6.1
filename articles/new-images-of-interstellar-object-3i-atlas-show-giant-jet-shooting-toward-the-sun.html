      <h2>New images of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS show giant 'jet' shooting toward the sun</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS show it emitting a large jet of gas and dust toward the sun. The images were captured on August 2, 2023, by the Two-meter Twin Telescope at the Teide Observatory in Spain's Canary Islands. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides further evidence of the comet's natural behavior. According to Miquel Serra-Ricart, an astrophysicist at the Teide Observatory, the jet is a common characteristic of comets. Researchers have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a high-speed comet, not an alien spacecraft as some have speculated.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS measures between 3 and 7 miles (5 to 11 kilometers) wide.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the largest interstellar object ever detected.</li>
    <li>It is estimated to be billions of years old, potentially predating the sun.</li>
    <li>The comet passed Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to the sun (perihelion) on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Visible from Earth again in mid-November 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in late June 2023 and confirmed by NASA in early July. The comet approached Mars on October 3, 2023, and is currently moving towards perihelion, which it will reach on October 29, 2023.</p>

<p>The new images were shared on October 15, 2023, on The Astronomer's Telegram, though they have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Miquel Serra-Ricart, chief science officer at the Teide Observatory's Light Bridges research institution, stated, "This is the usual. Jets are pointing to [the] sunward direction and [the] comet's tail in the anti-solar direction."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever detected, following the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet's behavior aligns with typical comet activity, which includes the emission of jets as they approach the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, astronomers will monitor its changes and the growth of its jet and tail. The comet is expected to be visible from Earth again in mid-November 2023, providing an opportunity for further observation. </p>
