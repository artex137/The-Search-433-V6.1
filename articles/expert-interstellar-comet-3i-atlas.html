      <h2>Expert: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Four major space telescopes have confirmed unusual findings about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Astronomers have reported that the Hubble, SPHEREx, James Webb, and TESS telescopes have observed the comet's early activity and surprising chemical makeup, indicating it may have formed in a planetary system very different from our own.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS could play a role in planet formation when captured by young star systems. The comet is noted as the oldest ever recorded, and it is one of only three known to have originated beyond our solar system. Richard Léveillé, an adjunct professor at McGill University and a NASA Participating Scientist with the Mars Curiosity Rover project, is available to provide insights on this topic.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the oldest ever recorded.</li>
    <li>It is one of only three comets known to have originated beyond our solar system.</li>
    <li>Four telescopes involved: Hubble, SPHEREx, James Webb, and TESS.</li>
    <li>Richard Léveillé is an expert commenting on the findings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed by multiple space telescopes, with findings reported recently. These observations have revealed its unique chemical composition and activity levels, leading to discussions about its origins and implications for planetary system formation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unusual findings about comet 3I/ATLAS could reshape our understanding of interstellar objects and their role in the universe,” said Richard Léveillé.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, with 3I/ATLAS being one of only three recorded. Previous studies of such objects have provided insights into the formation of planetary systems, but the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS may offer new perspectives.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and studies are expected to continue as researchers analyze the implications of 3I/ATLAS's findings for our understanding of planetary formation and interstellar objects.</p>
