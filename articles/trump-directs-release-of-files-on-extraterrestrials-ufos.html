      <h2>Trump directs release of files on extraterrestrials, UFOs</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he will declassify government files related to extraterrestrial life and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Trump made this announcement during a public address, stating that he will direct defense and intelligence officials to identify and release pertinent documents. He specifically tasked Secretary of War Pete Hegseth with leading the effort.</p>

<p>This move is significant as it responds to increasing calls for transparency regarding UAPs. Lawmakers, including Republican Missouri Rep. Eric Burlison, have been advocating for UFO disclosures and stronger whistleblower protections. This announcement comes amidst a broader conversation in Congress about declassifying UFO-related information and the potential implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, February 20, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Key Official:</strong> Secretary of War Pete Hegseth</li>
    <li><strong>Legislative Context:</strong> Calls from Congress for UFO disclosures and transparency</li>
    <li><strong>Prior Incidents:</strong> Navy footage of unidentified aerial phenomena from December 2020</li>
    <li><strong>Public Interest:</strong> Bipartisan interest in releasing UFO-related documents</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2020, Navy personnel captured footage of a triangular object emerging from the ocean near a U.S. warship. Defense officials acknowledged they could not identify the craft. In November 2023, former military and intelligence figures warned of a potential “catastrophic leak” if the government failed to declassify UFO-related information. Lawmakers began pushing for UAP disclosure provisions as they debated the National Defense Authorization Act.</p>

<p>On February 20, 2026, Trump announced his intention to direct top officials to release government files on extraterrestrial life and UAPs, emphasizing the importance of transparency in these matters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs),” Trump said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rep. Eric Burlison stated, “I’m looking forward to actually getting my hands on any kind of real physical evidence — whether that’s material evidence or biological samples, maybe from the corpse … at the end of the day, I remain skeptical until I get my hands on physical evidence.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This announcement reflects a growing trend among lawmakers to seek greater transparency regarding UAPs. Since at least late 2023, Congress has shown bipartisan interest in UFO disclosures, particularly following the acknowledgment of unexplained military encounters with aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Trump's directive aligns with previous concerns raised by military and intelligence officials regarding the risks of withholding information on UAPs from the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following Trump’s announcement, Secretary Hegseth will coordinate with relevant departments to begin the identification and release of the files. Lawmakers are expected to continue pressing for transparency and accountability regarding UAP investigations.</p>
