      <h2>Ancient Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Erupts as It Races Through Our Solar System</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is currently making its way through our solar system, putting on a dramatic display with vivid jets and a gas cloud. The comet, which originates from another star, has prompted astronomers to direct every available telescope towards it as it approaches Earth. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study matter from a distant part of the galaxy. The unusual chemical signature of 3I/ATLAS challenges existing theories about comet formation and the early solar system. Major space agencies are now focusing their efforts on gathering data from this ancient celestial body.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS originates from another star.</li>
    <li>Size of the comet's nucleus is between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Comet's closest approach to Earth is on 19 December 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is the predominant gas in the comet's coma, with an 8:1 CO<sub>2</sub>-to-water ratio.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA spacecraft involved include Lucy, MAVEN, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and others.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars occurred in October 2025, at roughly 30 million kilometres.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 21 July 2025, images from the Hubble Space Telescope revealed a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust around the comet's nucleus. This confirmed its identity as a comet rather than an asteroid.</p>
<p>In August 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope provided unexpected findings, indicating a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the gas cloud surrounding the comet.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars in October 2025, allowing for significant imaging opportunities. NASA announced a livestream event for data release on 19 November 2025, following a delay due to a government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks and behaves like a comet ... but this one came from outside our solar system, which makes it fascinating, exciting, and scientifically very important,” said NASA scientist Amit Kshatriya.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets from within our solar system typically carry the chemical signatures of the early Sun's environment. In contrast, 3I/ATLAS offers a direct glimpse into the composition of another star system, potentially reflecting formative conditions that differ from our own.</p>
<p>Current observations have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is indeed a comet and not an alien spacecraft. Its unique features contribute to its scientific value.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, ground- and space-based telescopes will continue to gather data until its closest approach on 19 December 2025. Further analysis may provide insights into the comet's origins and chemical makeup.</p>
