      <h2>NASA’s 3I/ATLAS “Training Drill” Fuels Theories—But Experts Say It’s Just Science</h2>

<p>A worldwide observing campaign for comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked speculation and conspiracy theories since its announcement on October 23, 2025. NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) have initiated a “planetary defence training exercise” designed to improve comet-tracking accuracy. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this initiative.</p>

<p>The campaign aims to enhance data collection on comets, which are difficult to measure due to their unpredictable nature. Authorities have emphasized that this effort is a scientific drill rather than a response to an imminent threat.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The observing campaign begins on November 27, 2025, and ends on January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>A mandatory workshop for participants is scheduled for November 10, 2025.</li>
    <li>A global coordination teleconference will take place later in November.</li>
    <li>Registration for participants closes on November 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>Only trained participants are allowed to contribute data to ensure quality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The IAWN has launched the training exercise to improve measurements of comet 3I/ATLAS, which is the first interstellar object ever included in such a campaign. The initiative has drawn interest due to the comet's unusual features, including a faint “anti-tail.”</p>
<p>Despite social media speculation suggesting a hidden threat, NASA and IAWN officials have reiterated that the campaign is focused solely on scientific accuracy and does not indicate any impending danger.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The initiative has one simple goal: better data,” said an IAWN official in a recent bulletin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is no hidden threat, no cover-up, and certainly no alien mothership lurking behind the glowing haze of 3I/ATLAS,” stated a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets like 3I/ATLAS present unique challenges for astronomers due to their unpredictable trajectories and the effects of their comas on measurements. The Minor Planet Center has described comets as “extended bodies,” which complicates orbit predictions and impacts planetary defence systems.</p>
<p>This campaign follows a series of prior initiatives aimed at improving tracking and response capabilities for potentially hazardous celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will conduct the training exercise with a focus on testing new techniques for tracking comets. Participants will contribute data collected during the campaign, which will be analyzed to refine current methodologies for planetary defence.</p>
