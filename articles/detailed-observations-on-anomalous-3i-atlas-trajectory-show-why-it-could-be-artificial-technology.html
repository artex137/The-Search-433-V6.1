      <h2>Detailed observations on anomalous 3I/Atlas trajectory show why it could be artificial technology</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has flagged the trajectory of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as anomalous, raising questions about its origins. The object, weighing approximately <strong>33 billion tonnes</strong>, is on a straight path that brings it close to several planets in the solar system. It passed within <strong>29 million kilometres</strong> of Mars on October 3, 2023, and is set to encounter Jupiter on March 16, 2026, at a distance of <strong>54 million kilometres</strong>.</p>

<p>This analysis matters because it suggests that the object may not be a natural space rock. Loeb has indicated that the chances of 3I/ATLAS following such a specific trajectory are extremely low, prompting discussions about the possibility of it being sent by an intelligent alien civilization.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed <strong>29 million kilometres</strong> from Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object will encounter Jupiter on March 16, 2026, at a distance of <strong>54 million kilometres</strong>.</li>
    <li>The chances of 3I/ATLAS aligning with the ecliptic plane is <strong>0.002</strong>.</li>
    <li>The probability of it arriving at the planets’ orbital radii is only <strong>0.0002</strong>.</li>
    <li>Loeb has compared the mass of 3I/ATLAS to the Starship, stating it is <strong>6 million times heavier</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, 3I/ATLAS passed within <strong>29 million kilometres</strong> of Mars. This event prompted further examination of its trajectory by scientists, including Avi Loeb. The object is scheduled to encounter Jupiter on March 16, 2026, when it will be <strong>54 million kilometres</strong> from the gas giant.</p>
<p>Loeb has published a blog post detailing the anomalies associated with the object’s trajectory, including its speed, light, and size. He has called for further observations from Mars orbiters and other missions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "For a natural object to take such a perfect path through our solar system seems unfathomable," said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The telescopes used by the senders of 3I/ATLAS are capable of noticing transits by rocky objects that are smaller than Earth," Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions around 3I/ATLAS have focused on its potential as a first contact scenario or an existential threat. The ongoing discourse is fueled by its unusual trajectory and the implications of extraterrestrial technology.</p>
<p>Loeb's findings challenge traditional understandings of interstellar objects and suggest a need for advanced observational capabilities to determine the true nature of such anomalies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations from Mars orbiters, including Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Express, TGO, MAVEN, Tianwen-1, and Hope, are expected to provide more data on 3I/ATLAS. Additional missions, including Juice and Juno, will also conduct observations in March 2026.</p>
