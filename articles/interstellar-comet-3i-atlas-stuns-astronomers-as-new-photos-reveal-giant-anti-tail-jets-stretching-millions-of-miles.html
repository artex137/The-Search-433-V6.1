      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Stuns Astronomers as New Photos Reveal Giant Anti-Tail Jets Stretching Millions of Miles</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has surprised astronomers with new images captured by Japanese astrophotographer Satoru Murata. His photographs, taken from New Mexico on the morning of [exact date not disclosed], show three distinct ionic jets and a sunward-pointing anti-tail as the comet passed by the galaxy NGC4691 under a thin crescent Moon. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about cometary physics. Authorities and scientists are now analyzing the images and the comet's unusual behavior, which confirms that 3I/ATLAS is following a hyperbolic trajectory and will permanently leave the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Photographer: Satoru Murata</li>
    <li>Location: New Mexico</li>
    <li>Date of images: [exact date not disclosed]</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 326 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Main tail length: 2.85 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Anti-tail jet length: 0.95 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Outflow speed: 0.4 km/s</li>
    <li>Estimated mass loss: 50 billion tonnes per month</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the morning of [exact date not disclosed], Satoru Murata captured images of 3I/ATLAS as it approached NGC4691. The images revealed three ionic jets and a prominent anti-tail. Scientists have since begun to analyze these findings, which defy many long-held assumptions about comets.</p>
<p>As the comet continues its journey, NASA's Juno mission is scheduled to pass 53 million kilometres from the comet in March 2026, while the ESA's Juice probe will be approximately 64 million kilometres away. Neither mission will be able to collect samples from the anti-tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I captured the interstellar comet early this morning as a thin crescent moon passed immediately next to it. Still was able to capture three separate jets of ionic tail, and an anti tail? Or the dust tail?” - Satoru Murata</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet presents a unique opportunity to study interstellar objects entering the Solar System. Its multi-jet structure and anti-tail could reshape theories regarding interstellar dust and comet formation. This comet's behavior has drawn comparisons to the interstellar object 'Oumuamua, which was observed in 2017.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from Murata's images and observe 3I/ATLAS with space telescopes such as Hubble and James Webb. The comet's behavior will be closely monitored as it moves further from the Solar System.</p>
