      <h2>Congress holds hearing on UAPs</h2>

<p>Four witnesses testified about their encounters with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) during a House Oversight Subcommittee hearing on September 9, 2023. The hearing focused on a purportedly secret UFO retrieval program managed by the Pentagon. No injuries or fatalities were reported.</p>

<p>This hearing marks the third such session in three years, following a July 2023 hearing that renewed public interest in UAPs. The government has shifted from using the term UFO to UAP, reflecting a formal rebranding. The testimonies included details about unidentified objects in U.S. airspace and a government initiative to capture and study these phenomena, contributing to public speculation about government transparency regarding UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2023</li>
    <li>Number of witnesses: 4</li>
    <li>Timeframe of UAP sightings reported: May 1, 2023 – June 1, 2024</li>
    <li>Total UAPs reported: 757</li>
    <li>Percentage of closed cases attributed to balloons: 70%</li>
    <li>Percentage of closed cases attributed to drones: 16%</li>
    <li>Regions with reported UAP sightings include the southeastern U.S., Gulf Coast, West Coast, Pacific Northwest, Middle East, and northeastern Asia.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 1, 2023, the reporting period for UAP sightings began, culminating in a total of 757 reported incidents by June 1, 2024. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office documented a range of sightings, noting that while many could be identified as conventional objects, a significant number remained unexplained.</p>
<p>The House Oversight Subcommittee conducted its hearing on September 9, 2023, as part of an ongoing investigation into the Pentagon's UFO retrieval program. This hearing follows a previous session in July 2023 that captured national attention.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The government has a concerted effort to capture and study those craft,” a witness stated during the hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Nearly half of Americans believe the U.S. government is concealing information about UFOs,” another witness noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The increase in reported UAP sightings has been attributed to a growing awareness and acceptance of the phenomena. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office reported that the geographical distribution of sightings aligns with areas near U.S. military assets, suggesting a potential bias in reporting.</p>
<p>In 2023-2024, a broad spectrum of UAP sightings was documented, with lights being the most commonly reported type. Despite many sightings being attributed to identifiable objects such as balloons and drones, the call for more scientific research continues.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP sightings are expected to continue, with authorities emphasizing the need for further research and efforts to destigmatize reporting. No specific deadlines or additional hearings have been announced at this time.</p>
