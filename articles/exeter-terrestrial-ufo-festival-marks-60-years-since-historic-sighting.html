      <h2>Exeter-terrestrial: UFO Festival marks 60 years since historic sighting</h2>

<p>The Exeter UFO Festival has commenced this weekend, celebrating 60 years since a notable UFO sighting that captured national attention. The two-day event runs Saturday and Sunday in downtown Exeter, New Hampshire, drawing enthusiasts and curious visitors alike.</p>

<p>The festival highlights the town’s connection to UFO lore and aims to engage the community. Organizers from the Exeter Area Kiwanis Club, which has hosted the event since 2009, have designed activities for families while raising funds for local charities. “Our goal is to provide two fun-filled days for the community,” said Bob Cox, vice president of the club.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>Location: Downtown Exeter, New Hampshire</li>
    <li>Cost for trolley tours: $5 per seat</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 3, 1965, 18-year-old Norman Muscarello reported seeing an unidentified flying object in Kensington, New Hampshire. He later convinced two Exeter police officers to investigate the sighting. The officers allegedly witnessed the object reappear, leading to widespread media coverage.</p>
<p>Since then, the Exeter UFO Festival has evolved, with the Kiwanis Club taking charge of its organization in 2009. The festival has grown to include various activities and expert panels, catering to a wide audience interested in the paranormal.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every year, we try to rotate or get new speakers, so that people don’t feel like they are coming year after year and listening to the same information,” said Cox. “We’ve been pretty successful with that.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I don’t know if that makes us famous or infamous, but it just floored me that we had made it all the way out there,” said festival coordinator Connie Cox, referring to visitors from Easter Island who recognized the Incident at Exeter.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Exeter UFO sighting has remained a significant event in UFO history, with continued interest from researchers and enthusiasts. The festival serves as a platform for discussions on historical ufology and government disclosures related to unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
<p>In recent years, the festival has attracted thousands of attendees from across New England and beyond, highlighting the enduring fascination with UFOs and related topics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The festival will continue through Sunday, featuring additional panels and community activities. Organizers plan to evaluate this year’s event to further enhance future festivals.</p>
