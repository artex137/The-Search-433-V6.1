      <h2>Scientist Puzzled by "Symmetric Jet Structure" on 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which recently made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2022. The observations have intrigued astronomers, particularly Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, who has noted an unusual configuration of jets emanating from the comet.</p>

<p>The significance of these findings lies in the ongoing debate about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. While some experts assert it is a natural comet, Loeb raises questions about its structure that could suggest it is of artificial origin. NASA scientists and other researchers continue to analyze the data to better understand the comet and its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: December 19, 2022</li>
    <li>Observation tool: NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope</li>
    <li>Key figure: Avi Loeb, Harvard astronomer</li>
    <li>Notable features: Three symmetrical jets, a prominent anti-tail</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar object: 1I/’Oumuamua detected in 2017</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2022. It made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2022. Images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in November and December have revealed a unique jet structure.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has speculated that the symmetrical jets could be linked to pockets of ice on the comet's surface, possibly influenced by heat from the Sun. This observation has led to renewed discussions about the potential for the comet to be an alien remnant, a theory Loeb has advocated since its discovery.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Are the symmetric triple-jet inner structure or the unlikely alignment of the rotation axis with the direction of the Sun, technological signatures? Or can they be a natural outcome of gas dynamics?” - Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Unlike 1I/’Oumuamua, 3I/ATLAS exhibits mostly typical cometary characteristics, including a coma and an unelongated nucleus.” - Breakthrough Listen researchers</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the detection of 1I/’Oumuamua, the first confirmed interstellar object observed in 2017, which also sparked discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial technology. However, the scientific community has largely supported the notion that interstellar objects are natural phenomena.</p>

<p>As of now, only three interstellar objects have been confirmed, highlighting the rarity of such events and the importance of studying them for a better understanding of our universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from Hubble and other telescopes to study 3I/ATLAS. Ongoing research aims to clarify the comet's characteristics and address the questions raised by Avi Loeb regarding its structure and potential origins.</p>
