      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Revisited Photo Shows Nucleus with Industrial Metallic Traces</h2>

<p>Astronomers have revisited an image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, captured on October 21, 2025, in Chile. The new analysis has revealed unexpected features in the comet's nucleus, including a dark depression and a coherent jet, which diverge from typical comet characteristics.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it raises questions about the comet's chemical composition and origin. Authorities have called for additional studies before the comet's upcoming close approach to the Solar System in December 2025. The analysis highlights the need for further investigations to understand these anomalies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>The October 21, 2025 image was taken with a 14-inch Dobsoniano telescope.</li>
    <li>The nucleus features a 3.2 km diameter dark depression and a 50,000 km long purple arc.</li>
    <li>The comet's dust-to-gas ratio is 0.05, significantly lower than expected.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of 57 km/s and is expected to pass near Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet's metallic signature resembles industrial alloys, confirmed by ESO’s Very Large Telescope in July 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2025, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS from 30 million km away, showing a symmetric nucleus. Observations continued through September and November, revealing unusual activity patterns and a significant lack of iron in the comet's composition.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT network detected radio signals suggesting outgassing typical of comets. The comet's structure remained stable across multiple measurements, contrasting with the behavior of typical solar comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The findings regarding the nucleus's geometry and chemical composition challenge our understanding of cometary bodies,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist. “This is the strongest evidence of non-gravitational propulsion ever recorded in interstellar visitors.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies of interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, have shown different compositional characteristics. The unusual features of 3I/ATLAS, particularly the nickel vapor and absence of iron, suggest a unique formation environment, potentially related to supernova events or extreme planetary formations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations are planned to analyze the comet's structure and composition as it approaches the Solar System. Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for additional data and insights leading up to its close pass to Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
