      <h2>3I/ATLAS alien spaceship theory 'confirmed' as latest image of 'thrusters' shared</h2>

<p>The theory that Comet 3I/ATLAS is an alien spaceship has gained further support, according to Harvard Professor Avi Loeb, who has championed the idea. A new image of the comet, taken by Satoru Murata in New Mexico, USA, on November 11, 2023, shows multiple jets trailing from the object.</p>

<p>This development is significant as 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Experts anticipate that this event will provide crucial data to determine the true nature of the comet, which Loeb has repeatedly suggested could be a spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was photographed on November 11, 2023, from New Mexico, USA.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The image shows multiple jets, including an anti-tail, according to Professor Loeb.</li>
    <li>Loeb has suggested that the anti-tail may be caused by technological thrusters.</li>
    <li>Murata captured the comet alongside the galaxy NGC4691.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 11, 2023, Satoru Murata shared an image of Comet 3I/ATLAS taken in New Mexico. The photograph shows the comet with multiple jets, which has led to renewed speculation about its origins. Professor Loeb has pointed to these features as potential evidence of advanced technology.</p>
<p>Loeb has stated that as more data is collected leading up to the comet's closest approach in December 2025, scientists will have a better understanding of what 3I/ATLAS truly is.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "There is the more speculative possibility that the anti-tail is a result of technological thrusters, which accelerate 3I/ATLAS away from the Sun through tightly collimated jets that penetrate a million kilometers through the Solar wind because of their high speed."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "With the flood of data on 3I/ATLAS in the coming weeks... we should be able to figure out its nature."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet has been a subject of interest since its discovery, with various theories about its origins and composition. Previous observations have shown unusual characteristics that have led some scientists to consider the possibility of artificial origins.</p>
<p>Loeb's assertions about the comet being a spacecraft have sparked debate within the scientific community, with many experts calling for further investigation and data collection.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, researchers will continue to analyze new data and images. The scientific community is focused on gathering evidence that may confirm or refute the theories surrounding the comet’s origins.</p>
