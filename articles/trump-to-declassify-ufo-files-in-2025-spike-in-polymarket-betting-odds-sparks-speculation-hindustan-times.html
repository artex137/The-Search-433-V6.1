      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-07 20:45 UTC</p>

      <h2>Trump administration may release UFO files in 2025</h2>

<p>The demand for the release of files related to Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) has surged following a spike in betting odds on Polymarket, a platform that allows users to wager on future events. Although the Trump administration has not made any formal announcements regarding UFO files, speculation has intensified that a decision could be forthcoming.</p>

<p>The potential release of these files matters as it aligns with the Trump administration's previous support for increased transparency concerning UFO sightings. The Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office has stated it has the administration’s backing to release more unclassified reports while safeguarding sensitive information.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Polymarket betting odds for Trump declassifying UFO files have risen from nearly 0% to 87% within a day.</li>
    <li>A trader, identified as @ster, has been purchasing "Yes" bets on the platform.</li>
    <li>No formal White House order has been issued regarding the declassification of UFO files as of late 2025.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office supports the release of more evidence and reports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, the demand for UFO file releases has not been prominent in the news. However, on a recent Sunday, a notable change occurred when betting activity on Polymarket indicated a strong belief in the potential declassification of these files by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Prior to this, the Trump administration had shown support for transparency regarding UFO sightings, but no specific directives had been made regarding the release of UFO-related documents.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office has the full support of the administration in releasing more raw evidence and unclassified reports while protecting sensitive equities,” a Pentagon spokesperson said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions around UFO files have been sporadic, with interest often peaking during significant announcements or events. The current speculation appears to be driven by a combination of increased public interest and recent betting activity, which has raised questions about the administration's intentions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, the Trump administration has not set a timeline for any formal announcement regarding the declassification of UFO files. The situation remains fluid, with ongoing interest from both the public and betting platforms.</p>
