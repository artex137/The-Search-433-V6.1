      <h2>Europa Clipper spends seven hours watching 3I/ATLAS as NASA studies elements in its surrounding plume</h2>

<p>The NASA spacecraft Europa Clipper has observed the comet 3I/ATLAS for seven hours on November 6, 2025, while positioned 164 million kilometers away. This observation marks a rare opportunity to study an object originating from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant as it provides insights into the behavior of interstellar objects as they approach the Sun. NASA scientists utilized the data collected to analyze the gas and dust surrounding 3I/ATLAS, which is crucial for understanding the composition and dynamics of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 6, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Europa Clipper to 3I/ATLAS: 164 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Duration of observation: 7 hours</li>
    <li>Comet origin: Outside our solar system</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Jupiter: March 2026</li>
    <li>Launch of Europa Clipper: October 2024</li>
    <li>Expected arrival at Jupiter: 2030</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 6, 2025, the Europa Clipper spacecraft conducted a seven-hour observation of 3I/ATLAS. The spacecraft was able to gather data from a unique vantage point, as Earth-based telescopes were hindered by sunlight obstructing the view.</p>
<p>During this observation, the Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) onboard Europa Clipper detected hydrogen, oxygen, and dust particles in the cloud surrounding 3I/ATLAS. This data was essential for analyzing the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This short observation gave scientists information they could not get from Earth. It helped them learn how objects from outside our solar system behave when they come close to the Sun,” a NASA spokesperson stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS is only the third instance of an object from outside the solar system being discovered. Previous observations have provided limited data, making this encounter particularly valuable for scientific research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following this observation, scientists will analyze the data collected to further understand the dynamics of 3I/ATLAS as it continues its trajectory toward Jupiter in March 2026. The findings may inform future studies of similar celestial objects.</p>
