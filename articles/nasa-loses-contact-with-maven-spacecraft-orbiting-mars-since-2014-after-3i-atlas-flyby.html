      <h2>NASA loses contact with MAVEN spacecraft orbiting Mars after 3I/ATLAS flyby</h2>

<p>NASA has lost contact with its MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) spacecraft on December 6, 2025, after the probe vanished behind Mars during its regular orbit. MAVEN had been gathering data from Mars for over a decade, and there are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the loss of communication.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as MAVEN has provided critical scientific data about Mars’ atmosphere and its interactions with solar activity. NASA teams are currently investigating the cause of the communication failure and assessing whether MAVEN can be reactivated. The agency stated, “More information will be shared once it becomes available.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of contact loss:</strong> December 6, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Mission duration:</strong> Over 10 years</li>
    <li><strong>MAVEN launch date:</strong> 2013</li>
    <li><strong>Martian orbit entry:</strong> September 21, 2014</li>
    <li><strong>Recent event:</strong> 3I/ATLAS flyby in October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Other NASA spacecraft:</strong> Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (2005), Mars Odyssey (2001)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>MAVEN was launched from Earth in 2013 and entered Martian orbit on September 21, 2014. The spacecraft has been conducting scientific research on Mars for over a decade. On September 27, 2025, MAVEN was tasked with capturing images of the comet 3I/ATLAS, which passed by Mars in October 2025. However, communication with the spacecraft ceased on December 6, 2025, as it moved behind the planet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“More information will be shared once it becomes available,” NASA said regarding the lost contact with MAVEN.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The MAVEN mission has been essential in understanding the Martian atmosphere and its evolution over time. The loss of contact comes at a critical juncture, just after the spacecraft provided valuable data on the comet 3I/ATLAS. NASA has previously experienced communication issues with spacecraft, but MAVEN has been one of its most successful missions in recent years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is investigating the cause of the communication failure and will assess potential measures to bring MAVEN back online. Further updates will be provided as the situation develops.</p>
