      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas breaks speed records with 38-mile-per-second solar pass</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, the third confirmed interstellar object entering the Solar System, has reached perihelion last week at a distance of 127 million miles (204 million kilometers) from the Sun, according to <em>Agora CNN</em>. The comet has not caused any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This event is significant because Comet 3I/Atlas has achieved a velocity of 38 miles per second (61 kilometers per second), marking the highest speed ever documented for a comet. Scientists are particularly interested in studying its unique characteristics, which differ from comets formed within the Solar System. Authorities are preparing for further observations and research as the comet approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas reached perihelion on October 27, 2023.</li>
    <li>It is located 127 million miles (204 million kilometers) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet's speed is recorded at 38 miles per second (61 kilometers per second).</li>
    <li>Its estimated age is between 5 to 7 billion years.</li>
    <li>The nearest point to Earth will occur on December 19, 2023, at 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 168 million miles or 270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Nasa's Clipper probe will pass through the comet's tail in December 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 27, 2023, Comet 3I/Atlas reached perihelion, drawing attention for its exceptional speed and unique composition. Scientists have noted its origins in the central region of the Milky Way, which differs from other comets in the Solar System. As December approaches, the comet will come closer to Earth, allowing for further study.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2023, the comet will be at its nearest point to Earth, providing a rare opportunity for observation, although it will require professional equipment to view.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Its dense structure and distant origin offer a unique opportunity to study the formation of other planetary systems," said Emerson Roberto Perez, an astronomer at the Urânia Planetarium, according to <em>Agora CNN</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is notable for being the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the Solar System. Its unique characteristics, including its age and speed, have generated significant interest among astronomers and researchers. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also provided insight into the formation of celestial bodies beyond our system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/Atlas approaches its closest point to Earth, NASA's Clipper probe will collect and analyze interstellar material from the comet's tail, marking a historic moment in space exploration.</p>
