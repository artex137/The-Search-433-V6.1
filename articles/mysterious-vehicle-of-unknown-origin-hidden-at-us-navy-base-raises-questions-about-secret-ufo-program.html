      <h2>Mysterious 'vehicle of unknown origin' hidden at US Navy Base raises questions about secret UFO program</h2>

<p>A report has revealed that a mysterious UFO has been allegedly stored at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, possibly since the 1950s. The claims, attributed to anonymous sources linked to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), suggest that the military has been reverse-engineering technology from non-human craft at the base for decades.</p>

<p>This matter has raised significant questions about the US military's involvement with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), as authorities are now examining the extent of potential espionage activities and the implications of possessing advanced extraterrestrial technology. UFO whistleblower Luis Elizondo has provided testimony regarding a specially built hangar at Pax River intended for the transfer of such technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Timeframe:</strong> Allegedly since the 1950s</li>
    <li><strong>Involved Agency:</strong> Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR)</li>
    <li><strong>Whistleblower:</strong> Luis Elizondo</li>
    <li><strong>Company Mentioned:</strong> Lockheed Martin</li>
    <li><strong>Company Status:</strong> Bigelow Aerospace went dormant in 2020</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since the 1950s, Naval Air Station Patuxent River has reportedly housed an 'exotic vehicle of unknown origin.' Recent claims have emerged from anonymous sources associated with NAVAIR, indicating that the site has been involved in analyzing technology from non-human craft.</p>
<p>In 2024, Luis Elizondo testified to Congress about the existence of a hangar at Pax River dedicated to transferring extraterrestrial technology. He mentioned that this facility was designed to facilitate the movement of advanced materials.</p>
<p>In 2025, reports surfaced about increased spying activities near the base, allegedly involving drones from China and unidentified aerial vehicles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These facilities included locations in the Las Vegas area and a newly built hangar at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station (‘PAX’),” said Elizondo during his testimony.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The US government allegedly has a secret contingency plan for moving the unidentified craft if its specific location at Pax River becomes publicly known or is threatened by further spying,” according to anonymous sources who spoke to Liberation Times.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This report comes on the heels of numerous sightings of unidentified drones along the East Coast, which began in late 2024. These drone swarms, reported to be large and silent, have drawn significant public and military attention. An unnamed private firm later claimed responsibility for the drone activity, stating they were conducting tests of advanced aerial craft.</p>
<p>Despite the US military denying the recovery of physical evidence of UFOs, multiple whistleblowers and scientists have claimed that various vehicles have been recovered since the 1940s, adding to the growing interest in the military's handling of UAP.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims about the hidden vehicle at Pax River and increased drone activity are ongoing, as authorities seek to determine the validity of these assertions and their implications for national security.</p>
