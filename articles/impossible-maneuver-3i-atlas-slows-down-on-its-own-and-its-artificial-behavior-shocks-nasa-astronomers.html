      <h2>Impossible maneuver? 3I/ATLAS slows down on its own and its artificial behavior shocks NASA astronomers</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual behavior by slowing down unexpectedly, raising concerns among NASA astronomers since early November 2025. This anomaly was detected after the comet emerged from behind the Sun, defying expectations of a typical trajectory for an interstellar object.</p>

<p>This behavior is significant as it challenges existing theories about celestial bodies and has prompted immediate attention from global space agencies. Scientists are investigating the implications of non-gravitational acceleration, which may suggest the presence of an external force acting on 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025, by the Atlas telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Slowed down on November 2025, approximately 203 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Exhibited a transverse variation of about 60 km per day.</li>
    <li>Passed Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Core estimated to be between 3.5 and 5.6 km in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Following its emergence from behind the Sun, scientists anticipated observing a comet tail. However, they were met with an absence of visual data that revived theories about the comet's artificial nature.</p>
<p>In early November 2025, the comet was observed to have decreased its speed, prompting further investigation by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Measurements indicated non-gravitational acceleration, suggesting the influence of an external force.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The measured deceleration is too precise to be coincidental,” said a NASA representative. “This behavior challenges our traditional understanding of interstellar comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS has led some scientists, including Avi Loeb, to propose that the comet may be a technological artifact. Previous interstellar objects have not exhibited such distinctive patterns of movement.</p>
<p>The comet's trajectory, which brings it close to planets like Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, raises questions about its origin and purpose. The fluctuations in its brightness further suggest deliberate adjustments in orientation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are aligning telescopes and computational models to analyze the comet's light curve, tail morphology, and acceleration vectors. This investigation aims to unravel the mysteries surrounding 3I/ATLAS and its potential implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
