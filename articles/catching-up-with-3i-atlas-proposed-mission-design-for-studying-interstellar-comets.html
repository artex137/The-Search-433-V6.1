      <h2>Catching up with 3I/ATLAS: Proposed mission design for studying interstellar comets</h2>

<p>The Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has completed a study detailing a proposed mission to explore interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has made headlines in 2023 as the third officially recognized interstellar object to enter the Solar System. The study outlines how a spacecraft could conduct a reconnaissance flyby of 3I/ATLAS to gather significant scientific data.</p>

<p>This mission design is important as it could enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. SwRI researchers assert that studying 3I/ATLAS and similar comets will provide insights into the formation and evolution of other star systems. The study comes at a time when next-generation telescopes, such as the Vera Rubin Observatory, are expected to discover many more interstellar objects in the upcoming decade.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to cross the Solar System.</li>
    <li>The first interstellar comet, Oumuamua, was discovered in 2017.</li>
    <li>The second interstellar comet, 2I/Borisov, was discovered in 2019.</li>
    <li>SwRI has developed a mission design to study interstellar comets.</li>
    <li>The proposed mission would involve a high-speed, head-on flyby.</li>
    <li>Estimates suggest up to 10,000 interstellar objects may be found within Neptune’s orbit each year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, astronomers discovered Oumuamua, the first interstellar comet. This was followed by the discovery of 2I/Borisov in 2019. In 2023, 3I/ATLAS was recognized as the third interstellar object to enter the Solar System. Following these discoveries, SwRI has conducted a study and developed a mission design to explore interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>SwRI researchers have calculated that a reconnaissance flight to 3I/ATLAS is feasible, utilizing a low-energy trajectory that requires fewer resources compared to other missions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is within the interceptable range of the mission we designed, and the scientific observations made during such a flyby would be groundbreaking,” said Matthew Freeman, principal investigator at SwRI.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar comets has opened new avenues for astronomical research. Prior to 3I/ATLAS, Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov provided initial insights into these exotic objects. As technology advances, researchers anticipate that the number of detected interstellar objects will increase significantly, offering a deeper understanding of their characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>SwRI continues to refine its mission design and trajectory calculations. Future steps include further testing of the proposed mission parameters and potential collaborations with other research institutions to enhance the scientific objectives of the study.</p>
