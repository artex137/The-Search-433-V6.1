      <h2>Researchers update the route of 3I/ATLAS with support from ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter</h2>

<p>Researchers have updated the route of comet 3I/ATLAS, utilizing data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). This update has improved predictions of the comet’s trajectory by a factor of ten compared to previous estimates. The data integration occurred as 3I/ATLAS approached Mars in October 2025, according to reports from Universe Today.</p>

<p>This development is significant for future observations and monitoring of the comet, which is the third interstellar object ever observed in the Solar System. The refined trajectory enables astronomers to plan more precise observations and enhances understanding of the comet's activity as it travels through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will safely pass by Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The updated trajectory is the result of combining Earth-based telescope measurements with observations from TGO.</li>
    <li>The trajectory predictions have improved by a factor of ten.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers at the Gemini South Observatory first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet was tracked by Earth-facing telescopes until October of the same year. As the comet neared Mars, both the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express orbiter captured images, refining its trajectory.</p>
<p>The updated trajectory was made possible by triangulating data from spacecraft orbiting Mars and ground-based observations, allowing for more accurate tracking as the comet continues its journey through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is the very first time ESA used the information of a Mars-orbiting spacecraft to pinpoint the location and the path of an object in space,” ESA teams noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The update to the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS illustrates the effectiveness of integrating data from various sources for planetary defense. The techniques employed may be applied in future surveillance of potentially hazardous objects, including asteroids or comets that could pose a threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves toward interstellar space, utilizing the updated trajectory for ongoing observations and studies. This work supports missions such as ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, which will benefit from the improved data for calibration and comparative studies of interstellar objects.</p>
