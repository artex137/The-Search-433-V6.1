      <h2>New Studies Can Explain Why Comet 3I/Atlas Isn't An Alien (Probably)</h2>

<p>New research has clarified the origins of Comet 3I/ATLAS, which was initially speculated to be of extraterrestrial design. The comet was discovered in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. This study, submitted to the Research Notes of the AAS, indicates that its unusual trajectory and behavior are typical of comets due to a phenomenon called outgassing.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it addresses months of speculation regarding the comet's nature. Some scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, had suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be alien technology. The new findings suggest that the comet's behavior aligns with known cometary characteristics and provide insights into the composition of distant solar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025 in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Comet's core estimated to be between 427 meters and 1,066 meters in diameter.</li>
    <li>Hit a top speed of 246,000 km/h as it passed outside Mars' orbit in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Study conducted by T. Marshall Eubanks and an international team of astronomers.</li>
    <li>Next major event: approach of Jupiter on March 15, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. By October 2025, it reaches a speed of 246,000 km/h while passing outside Mars' orbit. In December 2025, astronomers detect a strange radio signal from the comet, raising further speculation about its origins. In early 2026, a study submitted to the Research Notes of the AAS analyzes the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The results are pretty typical of ordinary comets, and certainly not record-breaking,” said T. Marshall Eubanks, author of the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time claims of extraterrestrial origins have emerged in connection with unusual celestial objects. In 2017, the interstellar object Oumuamua exhibited similar characteristics, prompting speculation about alien technology. The current study emphasizes the importance of rigorous scientific investigation over speculation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the study, astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter on March 15, 2026. Researchers will also focus on further analyzing the comet to gain insights into the composition of interstellar objects.</p>
