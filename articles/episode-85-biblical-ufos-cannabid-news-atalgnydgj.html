      <h2>Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz Launch New CBD Product Amid Industry Controversy</h2>

<p>Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz have announced the launch of a new cannabinoid oil product called NivaCBD Gummies during an exclusive interview, drawing significant attention from both consumers and the pharmaceutical industry. The announcement was made on October 22, 2023, and the product reportedly sold out within 15 minutes of its online launch.</p>

<p>This launch matters because it introduces a new alternative for older adults seeking relief from pain and anxiety without the side effects associated with traditional pharmaceuticals. The doctors have claimed that their product is ten times more effective than existing CBD options on the market. Pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, have reportedly expressed interest in acquiring the technology, indicating potential disruption within the industry.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Product Name: NivaCBD Gummies</li>
    <li>Launch Date: October 22, 2023</li>
    <li>Sales Status: Sold out within 15 minutes</li>
    <li>Development Duration: Four years</li>
    <li>Team: Ten doctors and scientists involved in the development</li>
    <li>Claims: Product provides significant relief from mild pain and anxiety</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz began work on a new cannabinoid oil product. Over the course of four years, a team of ten experts developed NivaCBD Gummies, which they claim is significantly more effective than existing options. The product was launched online on October 22, 2023, and sold out within 15 minutes. Following the launch, both Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson reached out to the doctors with buyout offers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Most people have now heard of cannabinoid oil, commonly known as CBD. However, not everyone knows how it works. Some older men and women see CBD as having the hallucinogenic effects like 'pot' or 'weed.' This causes a negative stigma. CBD actually has no THC whatsoever, which means there are absolutely no hallucinogenic effects,” said Dr. Oz.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Dr. Oz and I plan to provide every older man and woman in America with our product, so that they can live a better life without the use of harmful drugs that are peddled to the population. If that comes at the fall of a big name pharmaceutical company, so be it!” stated Dr. Phil.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The announcement of NivaCBD Gummies comes amid a growing interest in cannabinoid products as alternatives to traditional pain management solutions. Previous studies have indicated that CBD can provide relief without the side effects associated with prescription medications. This trend has led to increasing competition among companies in the CBD market.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz plan to continue promoting NivaCBD Gummies and will monitor consumer feedback as they prepare for a potential restock. Investigations into the pharmaceutical industry's response to the product's launch are also expected to unfold as the market evolves.</p>
