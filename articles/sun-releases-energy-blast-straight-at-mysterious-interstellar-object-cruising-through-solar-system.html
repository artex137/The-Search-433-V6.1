      <h2>Sun Releases Energy Blast Straight at Mysterious Interstellar Object Cruising Through Solar System</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has encountered a coronal mass ejection from the Sun earlier this week as it travels through the solar system at approximately 220,000 km/h. The comet is expected to make a close approach to Mars next week, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks a rare interaction between a comet and solar plasma. Astronomers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to understand how it has responded to this solar event. The object has already surprised researchers with its unusual characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at about 137,000 mph (220,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>The object is expected to pass within 1.67 million miles (2.7 million km) of Mars next week.</li>
    <li>The coronal mass ejection occurred earlier this week, exact time not disclosed.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS features a higher ratio of carbon dioxide to water than expected.</li>
    <li>Its estimated mass is greater than 33 billion tons and it measures at least 3.1 miles (5 km) across.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects, ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, were smaller than 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July and has since captivated astronomers. Earlier this month, the object became notably bright as it approached its perihelion, indicating an increase in gas production due to solar radiation exposure. This week, the Sun released a coronal mass ejection directed at 3I/ATLAS, marking a rare event in the study of comets.</p>

<p>Next week, 3I/ATLAS is anticipated to make its closest approach to Mars, providing an opportunity for scientists to observe the object further.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The effect, however, was only temporary — within minutes a new tail formed,” NASA explained in a 2015 blog post regarding similar events.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It’s a remarkable fine-tuning of its path,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, discussing the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interaction of comets with solar plasma is not unprecedented. In April 2007, NASA’s STEREO A spacecraft observed a comet, Encke, losing its tail after being struck by solar material. This phenomenon illustrates the dynamic nature of the solar system and the complex interactions between celestial bodies.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS has raised questions among scientists, particularly due to its unusual composition and trajectory, prompting discussions about its potential origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars next week. Observations during this close pass may provide valuable insights into the object's characteristics and its response to solar events.</p>
