      <h2>NASA's Mars orbiters and rover capture images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has successfully captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using its Mars orbiters and rover, despite the comet not being intended for their sensors. The images were released on November 27, 2025, after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history delayed previous disclosures. The comet passed by Mars at a distance of 19 million miles.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides valuable research opportunities about space. NASA's ability to capture these images demonstrates the versatility of its Mars missions and the advanced technology of its rovers and orbiters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet passed Mars at a distance of 19 million miles.</li>
    <li>Images were captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN orbiter (MAVEN), and Perseverance Rover.</li>
    <li>MRO captured its image in early October 2025.</li>
    <li>Perseverance captured its image from 18.6 million miles away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered. However, due to the government shutdown, NASA could not release information about the comet or its images. The shutdown ended, and on November 27, 2025, NASA shared the images captured by its Mars missions.</p>

<p>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured a monochrome image of the comet in early October, while MAVEN provided a composite image showing hydrogen surrounding the comet. Perseverance also captured a grainy image of 3I/ATLAS during its pass.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “These are some of the most fascinating images of outer space we have ever seen,” NASA stated in its release about the comet.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>NASA's Mars missions have provided significant insights into the Martian environment and beyond. The successful imaging of 3I/ATLAS reflects the advanced capabilities of the agency's technology, which has been developed over years of exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the images of 3I/ATLAS for further research opportunities regarding interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>
