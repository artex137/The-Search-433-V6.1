      <h2>Stunning Images Reveal Interstellar Comet Approaching Closest to Earth</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope and the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) have captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023. The comet, which originated from outside our solar system, has attracted significant attention since its discovery in July 2023. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This event is important for astronomers as it allows for unprecedented observations of an interstellar object. Authorities, including NASA and other space agencies, have coordinated efforts to study the comet's trajectory and composition, revealing critical information about its characteristics and behaviors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Close Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> 167 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Hubble’s Observations:</strong> First observed in July 2023 and again on November 30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Juice Mission Launch:</strong> April 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Juice Arrival at Jupiter:</strong> July 2031</li>
    <li><strong>Significant Distance During Observation:</strong> 41 million miles (66 million kilometers) away from the comet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. The Hubble Space Telescope first observed the comet shortly after its discovery. On November 30, 2023, it was 178 million miles (286 million kilometers) from Earth. Juice, which launched in April 2023, has also been capturing images of the comet as it travels toward Jupiter, where it will arrive in July 2031.</p>

<p>As the comet nears its closest approach, astronomers have coordinated multiple missions to study its trajectory and gases released during its solar pass in October 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The combination of discoveries from Hubble and Juice will significantly enhance our understanding of interstellar comets and the conditions of the early solar system,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object observed within our solar system. Previous observations of interstellar comets have provided insights into their origins and the early solar system's conditions. The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS is expected to contribute valuable data to this field.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will safely pass on the far side of the sun, posing no threat to Earth. More detailed data from Juice’s flyby is anticipated to arrive on Earth between February 18 and 20, 2024, promising new insights into the comet’s origins and evolution.</p>
