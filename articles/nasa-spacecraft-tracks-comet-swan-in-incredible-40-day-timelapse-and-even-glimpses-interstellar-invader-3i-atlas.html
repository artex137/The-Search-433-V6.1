      <h2>Nasa spacecraft tracks comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) in unprecedented detail</h2>

<p>Nasa's PUNCH mission has tracked Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) for nearly 40 days, capturing images every four minutes as it moved through the inner solar system. The spacecraft began its observations on August 25 and continued until October 2, 2023, marking a significant achievement in comet tracking.</p>

<p>This tracking effort is notable because it provides a continuous view of the comet, which is rarely observed in such detail. Craig DeForest, principal investigator for the PUNCH mission at the Southwest Research Institute, stated that this frequency of observation is unprecedented. The data collected may enhance understanding of comet behavior and the solar environment.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Nasa's PUNCH mission tracked Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) from August 25 to October 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was first discovered by Ukrainian amateur astronomer Vladimir Bezugly in September 2023.</li>
    <li>SWAN reached perihelion, its closest point to the sun, at a distance of 46.74 million miles (75.20 million km).</li>
    <li>The comet made its closest approach to Earth at 25.10 million miles (40.38 million km) in late October 2023.</li>
    <li>Images captured by PUNCH show the comet's bluish-green coma and its "hammerhead" shape.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was also visible in the PUNCH time-lapse, appearing near the end of the sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was first detected on September 1, 2023, by Vladimir Bezugly. The comet reached perihelion shortly after its discovery. Nasa's PUNCH mission began capturing images on August 25, leading to a nearly continuous observation period until October 2, 2023. In late October, the comet made its closest approach to Earth, increasing its visibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Other comets have been tracked at once-per-day cadence for years. What's new here is the few-minute cadence of observation,” said Craig DeForest.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Watching the sun's effects from multiple vantage points — and with different types of instruments — is what gives us a complete picture of the space environment,” said Gina DiBraccio.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are typically observed infrequently and for limited durations. The PUNCH mission's continuous tracking of C/2025 R2 (SWAN) offers a unique opportunity to study the effects of solar wind on cometary tails and their overall behavior in the solar system. Previous missions have not achieved this level of detailed observation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa plans to analyze the data collected from the PUNCH mission to enhance understanding of comet dynamics and the solar environment. Future observations may also focus on other comets as they approach the inner solar system.</p>
