      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shock: Scientists Reveal Comet Is 'True Outsider' With Alien Chemistry</h2>

<p>Scientists have confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, has displayed unique characteristics during its passage through our solar system. The comet, first observed by the ATLAS survey in Chile on July 1, 2025, has astounded researchers with its ancient age and alien chemistry. No injuries or fatalities have been reported during its transit.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to provide insights into the early universe and the formation of star systems. Researchers are currently analyzing data gathered from various telescopes to understand the comet's origins and its unusual chemical profile.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
  <li>It moves at a speed of 58 kilometers per second, reaching a maximum of 68 kilometers per second during its perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
  <li>The comet's eccentricity is 6.139, the highest ever recorded for an interstellar object.</li>
  <li>Its estimated age ranges between 8 and 14 billion years.</li>
  <li>Observations revealed high levels of carbon dioxide and traces of carbon monoxide and carbonyl sulfide.</li>
  <li>The comet passed Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometers on December 19, 2025.</li>
  <li>It is projected to reach the inner Oort cloud by the year 2189.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey in Chile first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Researchers noted its hyperbolic trajectory and high speed, distinguishing it from typical solar system comets.</p>
<p>During its perihelion on October 29, 2025, astronomers at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife observed unusual jets in the comet's anti-tail, suggesting a rotation period of approximately 15.5 hours.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2025, the Breakthrough Listen project used the Green Bank Telescope to search for radio signals from the comet. However, the results showed no credible signs of 'technosignatures'. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, before continuing its journey into the Leo constellation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The chemistry of 3I/ATLAS is distinctive relative to our solar system comets,” said Associate Professor Michele Bannister of the University of Canterbury. “Its makeup acts as a chemical fingerprint of a distant, alien environment.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Lead researcher Ben Jacobson-Bell stated, “We found no credible signs of technosignatures, effectively silencing theories of alien origin for the time being.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar comets have been recorded. The study of such objects helps enhance our understanding of cosmic history and the evolution of galaxies. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have reignited debates regarding the nature of interstellar objects and their potential for hosting life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS to gain further insights into its composition and origins. The scientific community anticipates that this comet will provide valuable information about the early universe and the formation of celestial bodies.</p>
