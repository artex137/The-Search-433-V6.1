      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Fires Eerie Radio Signals into Space: NASA Reinforces Surveillance in Panic Mode</h2>

<p>NASA has increased surveillance of comet 3I/ATLAS following the detection of unusual radio emissions, which were first intercepted by South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope on 24 October 2025. The comet, discovered in July, is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system, and it is currently moving at speeds exceeding 100,000 kilometres per hour.</p>

<p>The unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has prompted the Planetary Defence Coordination Office to enhance monitoring efforts. While officials assert there is no immediate risk of collision, the comet’s high speed and the distinct radio signals have raised concerns within the global astronomical community, leading to an urgent response from NASA and international observatories.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on 24 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Radio emissions measured at 1.6 GHz.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, at a distance of approximately 27 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Current speed of the comet exceeds 100,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>NASA has increased staffing in its Planetary Defence Coordination Office.</li>
    <li>Scheduled press conference in August 2025 to present findings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 24 October 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa intercepted strong radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS. Researchers identified these emissions as hydroxyl (OH) maser emissions, which occur when the comet approaches the Sun, heating its nucleus.</p>

<p>On 19 December 2025, the comet made its closest approach to Earth, providing an opportunity for detailed observations while remaining at a safe distance. NASA and the European Space Agency confirmed there was no risk of collision during this flyby.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no immediate risk of impact,” said a spokesperson from NASA’s Planetary Defence Coordination Office. “However, the nature of the emissions requires close monitoring.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The orbital calculations have proven robust,” said an ESA representative. “We are committed to extracting as much data as possible from this fleeting visitor.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is classified as a rocky fragment ejected from a foreign star system millions of years ago. Its size ranges between 320 metres and 5.6 kilometres in diameter, differing significantly from typical comets found in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud. Previous interstellar objects, like 2I/Borisov, have exhibited similar behaviours, prompting extensive study by major observatories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS closely, with a focus on analyzing the data collected during its passage. The upcoming press conference in August 2025 will provide preliminary findings and further insights into the comet's composition and behaviour.</p>
