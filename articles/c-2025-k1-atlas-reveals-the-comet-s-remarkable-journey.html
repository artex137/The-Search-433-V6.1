      <h2>C/2025 K1: ATLAS Reveals the Comet's Remarkable Journey</h2>

<p>Discovered in May 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), the comet C/2025 K1, also known as 'the golden comet', has surprised scientists by surviving its closest approach to the Sun on 8 October 2025. Initially expected to disintegrate, the comet instead emerged intact, trailing a dazzling golden plume.</p>

<p>This unexpected resilience has captured the attention of astronomers and the public alike. The comet's unique appearance challenges existing assumptions about cometary endurance and chemical composition, prompting further investigation into its origins and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> May 2025 by ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> 8 October 2025, within 50 million kilometres of the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> 25 November 2025, approximately 60 million kilometres (0.40 AU)</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere before dawn, direction east-northeast</li>
    <li><strong>Expected fade:</strong> Early December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>C/2025 K1 was discovered in May 2025. On 8 October 2025, it reached its perihelion, flying within 50 million kilometres of the Sun. Contrary to predictions, the comet survived this close encounter, emerging with a distinctive golden hue. It will reach its closest approach to Earth on 25 November 2025, providing a unique opportunity for observation.</p>

<p>Images from NASA's Centre for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) confirm that the comet retained its structure despite extreme solar radiation. Observers have noted its golden plume, a rare sight in cometary bodies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The survival of C/2025 K1 and its colour change have surprised astronomers, making it one of the most visually unique comets in recent history,” said a spokesperson from NASA's CNEOS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>C/2025 K1 originates from the Oort Cloud, carrying primordial material from the early solar system. Its unexpected resilience and colour transformation provide valuable insights into the diversity of cometary chemistry and the effects of solar radiation on icy bodies. Continuous sky surveys, like those conducted by ATLAS, are essential for monitoring such objects and potential hazards.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>C/2025 K1 will remain visible until early December 2025, gradually fading as it moves away from Earth. Observers are encouraged to capture this rare celestial event before it diminishes in brightness.</p>
