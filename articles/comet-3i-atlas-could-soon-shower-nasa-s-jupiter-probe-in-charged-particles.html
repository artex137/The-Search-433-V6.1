      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS could soon shower NASA's Jupiter probe in charged particles</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft may soon encounter charged particles from the ion tail of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS between October 30 and November 6, according to researchers at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The prediction indicates a rare opportunity to sample material from a comet that has traveled from beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it may provide valuable insights into the composition of interstellar comets. Samuel Grant, the lead researcher, emphasized the importance of such samples, noting that they could help scientists understand the conditions of the early galaxy. However, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown could hinder the spacecraft's ability to collect data, as it remains in cruise mode with not all instruments activated.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event window: October 30 to November 6, 2023</li>
    <li>Comet perihelion date: October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance of comet from the sun at perihelion: 126 million miles (200 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Distance of Europa Clipper from the sun: 186 million miles (300 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Research led by: Samuel Grant, Finnish Meteorological Institute</li>
    <li>Other researcher: Geraint Jones, European Space Agency</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2023, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the sun. This event coincides with the predicted alignment of the comet, the sun, and the Europa Clipper spacecraft. Between October 30 and November 6, the spacecraft may be able to detect charged particles from the comet's ion tail, depending on the status of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.</p>

<p>Researchers have used a computer program called Tailcatcher to predict the movement of solar wind packets, which may carry ions from the comet. This program has successfully identified past ion tail crossings, including that of comet C/2019 Y4 in 2020.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We study cometary bodies because they act as time capsules, sealing in material from their formation billions of years ago,” said Samuel Grant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This material is ejected on approach to the sun, a portion of which is transported away from the sun by the solar wind to form the ion tail,” added Grant.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are often described as time capsules of the early solar system, containing material that can provide insights into planetary formation. The study of interstellar comets is relatively new, with limited data available on their composition and origins. The ongoing government shutdown has raised concerns about the ability of NASA to execute planned observations and measurements during this critical period.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will monitor the situation closely as the event approaches. If the government shutdown is resolved, scientists may activate the necessary instruments on Europa Clipper to collect data on the charged particles from 3I/ATLAS. This opportunity could enhance our understanding of interstellar materials and their implications for the solar system.</p>
