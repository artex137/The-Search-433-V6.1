      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Baffles Astronomers with Sudden Speed, Blue Glow and Missing Tail</h2>

<p>Astronomers worldwide are closely monitoring a mysterious cosmic object named 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited an unexpected increase in speed and a notable change in colour as it approaches the Sun. First observed in July by a telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar visitor after ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth, as it will pass approximately 269 million kilometres away in December.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it raises questions about the behaviours of interstellar comets. Experts are currently investigating the reasons behind 3I/ATLAS's unusual acceleration and colour changes, as its behaviours challenge existing models of cometary activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First Detected: July 1, 2023, in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Current Speed: Approximately 244,600 kilometres per hour</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at Closest Approach: 269 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Next Close Approach to Jupiter: March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS survey team in Chile. On October 29, 2023, the comet exhibited a sudden increase in speed and began to display a blue glow as it neared the Sun. NASA scientists noted a small but unexplained acceleration not solely attributed to the Sun's gravity.</p>
<p>During this time, astronomers reported a loss of the comet's tail, which is unusual as solar heat typically causes comets to release gas and dust, forming bright tails. This disappearance has led to further investigations regarding the comet's behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “As it expels this material faster, it gets kicked back,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, discussing the potential causes of the comet's acceleration.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “That’s very significant statistically,” Loeb added, referring to a deviation observed in the comet's path. “The evaporation of about a sixth of its mass could lead to a visible gas plume around the comet in November and December.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object ever recorded, following the discoveries of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. The study of such objects is crucial for understanding the dynamics and composition of materials from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Ongoing observations will aim to clarify the mechanisms behind its unusual acceleration and the absence of a tail.</p>
