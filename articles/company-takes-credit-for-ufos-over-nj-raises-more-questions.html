      <h2>Company Takes Credit for UFOs over NJ, Raises More Questions</h2>

<p>Unidentified flying objects reported over New Jersey in November 2024 have been attributed to classified military tests, according to an anonymous source from a recent tech summit. The Army UAS and Launched Effects Summit revealed that a contractor has claimed responsibility for the mysterious aircraft sightings, which have puzzled residents and authorities alike.</p>

<p>This revelation raises concerns about the scale and transparency of the military's operations in densely populated areas. Local lawmakers and the FBI have expressed confusion about the lack of information regarding these tests. The incident has prompted further scrutiny of military protocols and their communication with the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: New Jersey</li>
    <li>Initial reports of UFO sightings began in November 2024</li>
    <li>Source: Anonymous contractor at the Army UAS and Launched Effects Summit</li>
    <li>Event date of the summit: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Claimed reason for sightings: Classified military tests</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2024, residents of New Jersey began reporting sightings of unidentified flying objects. These reports sparked widespread concern and confusion among the public and state officials. In October 2025, a source at the Army UAS and Launched Effects Summit revealed that the sightings were part of classified military tests conducted by an unnamed contractor.</p>

<p>The contractor demonstrated a new manned aerial craft at the summit, which is designed to be difficult to detect. This may explain why many witnesses reported the objects disappearing suddenly while moving across the sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” said an employee of the contractor, as reported by the New York Post.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The reported UFO sightings in New Jersey are part of a broader trend of increasing drone and unidentified aerial phenomena incidents across the United States. The military's use of advanced technology in populated areas has raised questions about public safety and the need for greater transparency in military operations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to investigate the implications of the contractor's admission and assess the impact of military testing in civilian airspace. Further inquiries may lead to discussions on military transparency and public communication regarding such operations.</p>
