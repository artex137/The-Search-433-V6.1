      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery Deepens: Avi Loeb Spots 13th Anomaly, Says Object May Be Targeting Jupiter</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has identified a 13th anomaly related to the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may be targeting Jupiter. The anomaly was reported on March 16, 2026, following the initial detection of the object by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025. There have been no injuries or fatalities reported in relation to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding has sparked renewed interest in the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which is the third confirmed interstellar object after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Loeb's research raises questions about whether the object is a natural phenomenon or a product of extraterrestrial technology. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, remaining at a safe distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>Initial observations began with pre-discovery data from June 14, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 30, 2025, at 1.35 AU.</li>
    <li>Object's nucleus estimated to be between 440 meters and 5.6 km in diameter.</li>
    <li>Loeb identified 13 anomalies, the most recent suggesting targeting of Jupiter.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter recorded at 53.445 million km on March 16, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2025, pre-discovery observations of 3I/ATLAS were made by ATLAS and Caltech’s Zwicky Transient Facility. The object was officially detected on July 1, 2025. Following its perihelion on October 30, 2025, astronomers continued to observe it, noting various anomalies throughout its trajectory. The 13th anomaly was identified in March 2026, indicating a potential targeting of Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This extraordinary coincidence implies fine-tuning, with jets possibly serving as thrusters,” said Avi Loeb, emphasizing the significance of the 13th anomaly.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has prompted debate in the scientific community regarding its origins. While some researchers assert it is a natural interstellar object, others, led by Loeb, argue that its characteristics suggest engineered origins. Previous interstellar objects like 1I/'Oumuamua have faced similar scrutiny, leading to ongoing discussions about the nature of extraterrestrial life and technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue as it approaches Jupiter. Researchers will analyze data from various NASA missions to further investigate the object's composition and trajectory. Future studies may focus on determining whether the anomalies are the result of natural processes or indicative of artificial origins.</p>
