      <h2>Unidentified Flying Objects Reported Over Bulgaria on December 30, 1978</h2>

<p>Residents of Sofia, Pleven, and Vratsa have reported sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the sky on December 30, 1978, causing confusion among the population. Eyewitnesses describe luminous bodies with unusual shapes and movements but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The sightings have prompted authorities to issue an official explanation attributing the phenomena to the planet Venus, which is particularly bright at this time. However, many researchers and witnesses find this explanation unconvincing due to the dynamic movement of the observed objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> December 30, 1978</li>
    <li><strong>Locations:</strong> Sofia, Pleven, Vratsa</li>
    <li><strong>Eyewitness Reports:</strong> Numerous citizens observed the phenomena</li>
    <li><strong>Official Explanation:</strong> Planet Venus, according to authorities</li>
    <li><strong>Height of Objects:</strong> Approximately 1,000 meters</li>
    <li><strong>Witness Descriptions:</strong> Luminous bodies with red and silver hues</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 29, 1978, at 05:40, an unusually luminous body was observed above the village of Bohot in Pleven district. At 06:10, witnesses reported that the body appeared as large as the Moon and remained motionless at a height of about 1,000 meters. A second similar object appeared at 07:00, moving horizontally before disappearing to the west.</p>

<p>On December 30, 1978, before noon, thousands of people in Sofia crowded the streets to observe a strange body in the sky. A BTA reporter contacted the University Astronomical Observatory, where astronomer Simeon Vladimirov confirmed that the identified object was indeed Venus.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"In my opinion, this is not a serious phenomenon, because I have long said goodbye to flying saucers," said Professor Kiril Serafimov, Chairman of the Bulgarian Committee for the Exploration and Use of Outer Space.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>"From the observatory we could see the Sun, Venus and a few clouds," said Simeon Vladimirov, chief assistant of the University Astronomical Observatory. "Sometimes this luminary can be seen during the day, but only by people with strong eyesight."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a pattern of reported UFO sightings in various regions, raising questions about the natural versus artificial explanations for such phenomena. Authorities have often attributed similar sightings to natural celestial events, such as planets or atmospheric conditions, while researchers continue to investigate the claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor public reactions and investigate the reported phenomena, but further official inquiries or investigations have not been disclosed at this time.</p>
