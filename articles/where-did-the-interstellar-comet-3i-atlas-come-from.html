      <h2>Where Did The Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Come From?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object (ISO) ever detected, was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) station on 1 July 2025. It is travelling through the inner Solar System at approximately 220,000 km/h and will make its closest approach to the Sun in late October 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for researchers as they attempt to understand the origins of interstellar objects. Authorities, including multiple observatories and interplanetary missions, are currently focused on studying 3I/ATLAS to gather more data about its composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 220,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: Late October 2025</li>
    <li>Observatories involved: JWST, Two-meter Twin Telescope</li>
    <li>Research published in: The Astrophysical Journal Letter</li>
    <li>Lead author: Xabier Pérez Couto, Universidade da Coruna, Spain</li>
    <li>Number of stellar encounters identified: 93</li>
    <li>High-confidence encounters: 62 with main sequence stars</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS station. Observations began shortly after, with the Two-meter Twin Telescope capturing images from 2 to 3 July 2025. Research utilizing data from the ESA's Gaia mission has been ongoing, aiming to trace the comet's trajectory and potential encounters with other stars.</p>

<p>The research titled "3I/ATLAS: In Search of the Witnesses to Its Voyage" analyzes the comet's past trajectory over the last 10 million years, revealing important insights about its origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered to date, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unusually high excess velocity and active cometary nature make it a key probe of the Galactic population of icy planetesimals,”</blockquote>
<p>the researchers stated in their paper.</p>

<blockquote>“We conclude that 3I/ATLAS has not experienced any stellar flybys within the past 4 Myr, among the stars contained in Gaia DR3, that could account for its present trajectory nor its origin,”</blockquote>
<p>the authors added.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows in the footsteps of previous interstellar objects, including 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of these ISOs is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems across the galaxy. The increasing detection of interstellar objects is expected, particularly with advancements in observational technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue as it approaches the Sun. Researchers aim to gather more data to clarify its origins and trajectory, while the Vera Rubin Observatory is expected to enhance detection of similar interstellar objects in the coming years.</p>
