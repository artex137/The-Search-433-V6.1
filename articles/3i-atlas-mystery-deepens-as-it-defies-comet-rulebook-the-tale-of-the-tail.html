      <h2>3I/ATLAS mystery deepens as it defies comet rulebook</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, has baffled scientists since its discovery on July 1, 2023, as it exhibits unusual behaviour that challenges conventional comet characteristics. The object, which swung by the Sun at the end of October, has shown unexpected brightening and an absence of a typical cometary tail.</p>

<p>This phenomenon matters because it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and the principles governing comet behaviour. Scientists, including Harvard professor Avi Loeb, are investigating the object's peculiarities, particularly its brightness and lack of a tail, as they seek to understand its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 29-30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Previous close encounters:</strong> Flew by Mars on October 2-3, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness increase:</strong> Became five times brighter than expected in May</li>
    <li><strong>Notable observations:</strong> Captured by NASA's TESS and ESA's ExoMars TGO</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2023. Initial observations showed no tail, with a faint one only noted in September. In May-June, precovery images from NASA's TESS indicated an unexpected brightening. On October 2-3, it passed Mars and was observed by the ESA, which noted a white ball of light without a tail. The object reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 29-30, exhibiting unusual brightness and turning a bright blue.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We can’t see the tail in the CaSSIS images, but it may become more visible in future observations,” said the European Space Agency regarding its October observations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If we do not soon see at least 5 billion tons of cloud of gas and dust around the object, then it would mean there is something off with it,” stated Avi Loeb, raising concerns about the object's characteristics.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following Oumuamua and Borisov. Its behaviour has drawn significant attention from astronomers, especially since it exhibits characteristics that do not align with established comet behaviour. The object's brightening and lack of a tail have sparked debates within the scientific community about its true nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. Investigations into its unusual properties are ongoing, with researchers looking for further data to explain its behaviour. Future observations may provide more insights into the object's composition and trajectory.</p>
