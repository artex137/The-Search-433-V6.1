      <h2>Astronomers intrigued by odd light emitted by interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have identified a peculiar object named 3I/ATLAS, which has raised questions since its discovery this summer. First spotted on July 21, 2025, the interstellar visitor is behaving unusually, leading researchers to explore its origins and characteristics.</p>

<p>The significance of this discovery lies in the object’s potential to reshape our understanding of interstellar bodies. Authorities, including NASA, are preparing to observe 3I/ATLAS closely as it approaches Mars later this year.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First observed: July 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Close approach to Mars: October 3, 2025, within about 29 million kilometers</li>
    <li>NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will observe the object during its flyby</li>
    <li>Brightness requires approximately 10 gigawatts of power</li>
    <li>Estimated size: less than 100 meters across</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 21, 2025, when NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope captured its image. The object exhibited a glowing coma but lacked the typical tail associated with comets. Researchers have debated its nature since its discovery, with some suggesting it might be a fragment of technology rather than just an icy body.</p>

<p>As it approaches Mars, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is scheduled to gather detailed images during its flyby on October 3, 2025. This observation may provide critical insights into the object’s properties and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This cannot be ruled out,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard University astrophysicist, regarding the possibility that 3I/ATLAS might be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy. “But requires better evidence to be viable.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS builds on previous findings of interstellar objects, including ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov. These earlier discoveries have already prompted discussions about the nature of objects entering our solar system and the possibility of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<p>Recent analyses indicate that 3I/ATLAS’s brightness profile diverges from typical expectations for comet behavior, leading to ongoing debates among scientists about its classification.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the Mars flyby approaches, scientists will closely analyze the data collected by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The findings may clarify whether 3I/ATLAS is a conventional comet, a rare radioactive fragment, or a technological artifact, potentially reshaping our understanding of interstellar phenomena.</p>
