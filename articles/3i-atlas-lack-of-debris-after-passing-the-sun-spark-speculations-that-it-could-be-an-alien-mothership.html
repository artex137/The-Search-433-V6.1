      <h2>3I/ATLAS' Lack of Debris After Passing the Sun Sparks Speculations That It Could Be an Alien Mothership</h2>

<p>New evidence surrounding comet 3I/ATLAS has raised questions about its unusual behavior after a close encounter with the Sun on 30 October 2025. Astronomers have reported no debris or clear damage from the interstellar object, which NASA has classified as a comet despite its atypical characteristics.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges existing understandings of comet behavior. Following its perihelion passage, experts are investigating the lack of expected cometary features, which has led to bold claims regarding the possibility of artificial origins for 3I/ATLAS. NASA has stated that the comet will remain distant from Earth, with its closest approach estimated at approximately 1.4 AU (astronomical units).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed closest to the Sun on 30 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest distance to Earth is approximately 1.8 AU.</li>
    <li>Nobody reported debris, fragments, or damage after its solar encounter.</li>
    <li>A bright coma around a compact mass was observed.</li>
    <li>Gas streamed outward in two jets during the passage.</li>
    <li>Experts David Jewitt and Jane Luu conducted observations using Spain's Nordic Optical Telescope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first classified by NASA as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic orbit, which originates outside the solar system. Following its perihelion on 30 October 2025, astronomers conducted observations that revealed no signs of fragmentation or dust production, which are typical for comets.</p>

<p>In the months leading up to its closest approach, NASA expected faint visibility starting in September, followed by renewed viewing opportunities in early December. As data continued to pour in, experts noted anomalies that deviated from standard comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS continues as an active, single body, with no evidence for breakup following the recent perihelion passage,” said astronomers David Jewitt and Jane Luu.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nasa explained that “usually, when a comet's orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets typically shed material as they approach the Sun due to intense heat, leading to fragmentation and the formation of dust trails. The lack of debris from 3I/ATLAS is especially puzzling in light of this behavior. Previous encounters with comets have shown that most break apart under similar conditions.</p>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the object’s origins, suggesting there is a “30 to 40 per cent chance that the comet was not a naturally formed object” and could possess “active intelligence.”</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory away from the Sun, astronomers will gather further data to investigate its characteristics. Ongoing analysis may provide more answers about this unusual interstellar visitor and its potential origins.</p>
