      <h2>Scott Cooper to direct new UFO movie</h2>

<p>Director <strong>Scott Cooper</strong> has announced his next project, a film about the 1947 Roswell incident, in collaboration with <strong>20th Century Studios</strong>. The announcement comes after Cooper's recent work on <strong>Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere</strong>, set to release in 2025. The Roswell incident has long fueled conspiracy theories about extraterrestrial life and alleged military cover-ups.</p>

<p>This new film is significant as it taps into a growing interest in UFOs and alien life in popular culture, particularly within the film industry. As Hollywood explores this theme, Cooper joins a list of notable directors, including <strong>Joseph Kosinski</strong>, <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>, and <strong>Colin Trevorrow</strong>, who are also working on similar projects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Director: Scott Cooper</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, debris found by a rancher in Roswell, New Mexico, sparked claims that the U.S. military recovered a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft. Initially, the U.S. Air Force issued a press release stating they had discovered a “flying disc,” but later retracted this statement, claiming it was a weather balloon.</p>

<p>In the years since, the Roswell incident has become a cornerstone of UFO conspiracy theories, suggesting a government cover-up of extraterrestrial life. More recently, in 2022, the documentary <strong>The Age of Disclosure</strong> presented testimonies from former U.S. government officials addressing these claims.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I suppose if you can make four Beatles movies, you can make a couple of Bruce Springsteen movies,” Cooper said regarding his desire to explore more of Springsteen's life on film.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Cooper also noted, “There are so many chapters in Bruce’s life, in all seriousness, that are quite right for cinematic treatment.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in UFOs and alien life has surged in recent years, with various Hollywood projects exploring these themes. The Roswell incident, in particular, has remained a focal point of speculation and intrigue, contributing to ongoing public fascination with the possibility of extraterrestrial existence. The documentary <strong>The Age of Disclosure</strong> has further fueled discussions about potential government cover-ups regarding non-human intelligent life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Cooper is set to begin writing and directing the UFO film, with further details about production timelines and casting not disclosed. As interest in UFO narratives continues to grow, this project may contribute to the ongoing dialogue surrounding extraterrestrial life and government transparency.</p>
