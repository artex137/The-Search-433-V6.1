      <h2>UN Network Closely Watching Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The United Nations' International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has been monitoring interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS since late November 2025 as it approaches Earth, set to make its closest approach on December 19, 2025. The comet, which poses no risk of impact, is currently about 167 million miles (270 million kilometres) from Earth.</p>

<p>This monitoring effort is significant as it represents a live test case for global planetary defence systems. The IAWN, which coordinates over 80 observatories worldwide, is conducting a dedicated observation campaign to study the comet's composition and behaviour. James Bauer, a principal investigator at IAWN, has stated that this campaign aims to strengthen technical capabilities for tracking near-Earth objects (NEOs).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 167 million miles (270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign Start:</strong> Late November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Participants:</strong> 171 at kickoff, 100 at mid-campaign check-in on December 9, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>First tracked interstellar object:</strong> Since IAWN's campaigns began in 2017</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Late November 2025: The IAWN begins a dedicated observation campaign for comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>October 2025: The campaign kicks off with 171 participants, marking a record for the network.</p>
<p>December 9, 2025: A mid-campaign check-in occurs, attracting 100 participants.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The idea behind these campaigns is really to strengthen the technical capabilities for measuring sky positions, which we call astrometry, for asteroids and comets,” said James Bauer, a small-bodies node principal investigator at IAWN.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The monitoring of 3I/ATLAS is particularly notable as it is the first interstellar object tracked by the IAWN. Previous campaigns have focused on near-Earth objects, such as the potentially hazardous asteroid Apophis, which IAWN observed in 2020 and 2021.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data collected from the observation campaign will be analyzed, with full findings expected to be published in a peer-reviewed journal next year. This effort will enhance global preparedness for future cosmic threats.</p>
