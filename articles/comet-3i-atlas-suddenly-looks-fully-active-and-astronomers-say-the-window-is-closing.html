      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS suddenly looks “fully active” — and astronomers say the window is closing</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is now shedding more gas and dust following its closest approach to the Sun on December 19, 2025. The comet is expected to reach opposition on January 22, 2026, allowing for extended tracking by ground observers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed in the solar system, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Scientists are working to gather as much data as possible, as the comet is on a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it will not be captured by the Sun’s gravity and is already moving away from the Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach opposition on January 22, 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA estimates the comet passed 1.8 astronomical units from Earth.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project will host a live online observing session starting at 23:30 UTC on January 22, 2026.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx has observed the comet from December 8 to December 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>Water-gas emissions were reported to be 20 times stronger than earlier observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first reported on July 1, 2025, by a telescope in the ATLAS network, which is funded by NASA to detect potentially hazardous objects. Following this, the comet made its closest approach to the Sun on December 19, 2025, where it entered a more active phase.</p>
<p>From December 8 to December 15, 2025, NASA’s SPHEREx telescope collected infrared data, revealing increased emissions of gases such as water and carbon monoxide. The comet is now on an outbound trajectory, with a future pass by Jupiter scheduled for March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks and behaves like a comet,” said NASA associate administrator Amit Kshatriya in November 2025 regarding the comet's characteristics.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Oxford astrophysicist Chris Lintott dismissed claims of an artificial origin for the comet, calling them “simply nonsense.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of interstellar objects is rare, with 3I/ATLAS being only the third confirmed case. The comet's behavior provides insights into how comets from outside the solar system react to solar radiation, particularly after crossing the solar system’s “ice line,” where sunlight can convert ice into gas.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun. The upcoming opposition on January 22 will provide a crucial opportunity for ground-based observations, though conditions such as cloud cover and moonlight may limit visibility.</p>
