      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, passing within about 170 million miles of the planet. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet. Although it is not visible to the naked eye, the comet can be observed with a small telescope or via live streams.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>The close approach of 3I/ATLAS provides a significant opportunity for scientists to study an object that originated from another star system. NASA and astronomers worldwide have worked to dispel conspiracy theories regarding the comet, emphasizing its scientific value rather than any potential dangers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 2025, at approximately 1 a.m. ET</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: about 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Speed: 137,000 mph when first discovered</li>
    <li>Estimated size: 1,400 feet to 3½ miles in diameter</li>
    <li>Visible range: East to northeast under the star Regulus in the constellation Leo</li>
    <li>Live stream: Virtual Telescope Project on YouTube starting at 11 p.m. ET on December 19</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025, marking it as the third object confirmed to originate outside the solar system. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory and speed, confirming its interstellar origin. On November 19, 2025, NASA released new images of the comet, revealing its icy nucleus.</p>
<p>The comet's trajectory has been analyzed using data from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It is on a hyperbolic orbit that will eventually take it back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What 3I/ATLAS's close approach to Earth does represent, however, is the best opportunity for scientists to study an object that formed deep in space,” NASA officials have stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is the third interstellar object identified by astronomers, following previous discoveries that have piqued public interest in extraterrestrial phenomena. The comet's journey from the constellation Sagittarius has highlighted the ongoing research into objects that travel between star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, 3I/ATLAS will continue to be monitored as it moves away from Earth, providing further data for scientists studying interstellar objects.</p>
