      <h2>Europa Clipper’s UV look at Comet 3I/ATLAS backs water-ice call as radio “technosignature” scan finds none</h2>

<p>NASA’s Europa Clipper spacecraft has observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in ultraviolet light from approximately 102 million miles away on November 6, 2025, according to the SETI Institute. The spacecraft detected hydrogen and oxygen in the comet’s coma, indicating water-ice sublimation, and found no evidence that the comet has broken apart.</p>

<p>This observation is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object to pass through the solar system from outside it, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet, first reported on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile, is on a hyperbolic trajectory and will not pose a hazard to Earth. It is expected to remain visible in the pre-dawn sky until spring 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 6, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 102 million miles</li>
    <li>Comet reported: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Project using the observation: NASA’s Europa Clipper</li>
    <li>Secondary observation: Europe’s JUICE mission on November 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Radio observations: Breakthrough Listen program on December 18, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in Chile reported the discovery of comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet was observed by the Europa Clipper spacecraft on November 6, 2025, with a focus on detecting water-ice sublimation. A few days later, on November 2, Europe’s JUICE mission also captured images of the comet. The comet reached its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, with radio observations conducted by the Breakthrough Listen program the day before.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We all would have been thrilled to find technosignatures coming from 3I/ATLAS, but they’re just not there,” said Benjamin Jacobson-Bell, lead researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it contributes to the understanding of interstellar objects within our solar system. Its trajectory and composition may provide insights into the formation of celestial bodies. The detection of water-ice in its coma aligns with previous findings regarding the presence of water in other comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the observing window for 3I/ATLAS closes, further investigations may be limited. Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected by the Europa Clipper and JUICE missions, but questions regarding the comet's activity as it fades may remain partially unanswered.</p>
