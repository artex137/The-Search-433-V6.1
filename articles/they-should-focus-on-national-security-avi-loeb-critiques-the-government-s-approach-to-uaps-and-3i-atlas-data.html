      <h2>They should focus on national security: Avi Loeb critiques the government’s approach to UAPs and 3I/ATLAS data</h2>

<p>Harvard physicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has criticized the government’s handling of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> during a podcast episode that aired on December 9, 2025. Loeb expressed his concerns over the government’s secrecy regarding information related to space, particularly UAPs and 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to come closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 168 million miles.</p>

<p>Loeb's critique highlights the need for better collaboration between the government and scientific experts in the study of interstellar objects. He believes that the government should prioritize national security and allow scientists to investigate these phenomena without interference. Loeb has initiated his own project, the <strong>Galileo Project</strong>, to monitor the sky and analyze potential anomalies using advanced technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of podcast:</strong> December 9, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach of 3I/ATLAS:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 168 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Galileo Project:</strong> Founded by Avi Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Number of observatories:</strong> Three, including one in Las Vegas</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 9, 2025, Avi Loeb appeared on The Chris Cuomo Project podcast and expressed his dissatisfaction with the government’s management of UAPs and the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. He emphasized the need for more transparency and collaboration with scientists in the study of these phenomena. Loeb reported that he established the Galileo Project to independently monitor and analyze interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “They should focus on national security. Instead of concealing information... they should focus on protecting the country and let the experts study the anomalous objects in interstellar space.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb added, “If there are [outliers], we can analyze them in a scientific way, inform everyone, it will not be a secret, it will not be classified.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This critique comes amid ongoing discussions about government transparency and accountability regarding UAPs. Loeb has previously indicated that the government's tendency to classify important information may stem from a desire to conceal shortcomings rather than to protect national security. The Galileo Project aims to address these gaps by utilizing advanced technologies for sky observation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb plans to continue his work with the Galileo Project, which aims to observe and analyze millions of objects in the sky over the next year. He has called for increased funding for space exploration to address potential threats from interstellar objects.</p>
