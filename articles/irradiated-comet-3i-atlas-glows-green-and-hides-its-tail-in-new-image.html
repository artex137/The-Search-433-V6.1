      <h2>Irradiated Comet 3I/ATLAS Glows Green and Hides Its Tail in New Image</h2>

<p>A researcher at the Lowell Observatory has captured a new image of comet 3I/ATLAS glowing green and appearing to hide its tail as it moves away from the sun on November 5. Qicheng Zhang used the observatory's Discovery Telescope in Arizona to take the image, marking a crucial observation phase for the interstellar comet.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insights into the comet's composition and behavior after its closest approach to the sun, known as perihelion, which occurred on October 29. Astronomers are eager to study the comet's gases and characteristics during this active phase.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was imaged on November 5, 2023.</li>
    <li>The image was taken at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently observable in the early morning skies.</li>
    <li>Qicheng Zhang is the researcher who captured the image.</li>
    <li>The comet's appearance is influenced by diatomic carbon (C₂) particles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2023, has gained attention for its unusual characteristics. It reached perihelion on October 29, 2023, which is when it is closest to the sun. Following this event, Zhang made initial observations of the comet on October 31. The latest image was captured on November 5, revealing a green glow.</p>

<p>During its close approach to the sun, the comet developed an atmosphere, or coma, which is visible in the new images. Zhang noted that the comet's apparent lack of a dust tail is not a cause for concern, as it is still present but is viewed head-on.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It's sort of for the same reason that if we stay out in the sun too long without sunscreen, we get sunburnt,” Zhang said. “The UV rays are destroying our DNA, which is kind of a similar type of molecule in the sense that it's big and contains carbon.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar visitor recorded and may be the oldest comet observed, with studies suggesting it is around 3 billion years older than the solar system. Its discovery has led to speculation about its origins, although astronomers believe it is a comet from an unknown star system within the Milky Way.</p>

<p>The comet has been notable for its changing colors and activity levels, particularly after perihelion when it is typically most active.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues to be observable, astronomers expect to gather more data on its composition and behavior in the coming months. Further studies will focus on understanding the effects of space radiation on the comet's material and its implications for deciphering its origins.</p>
