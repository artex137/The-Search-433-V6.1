      <h2>3I/ATLAS Spraying Material as It Exits the Solar System</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, the third of its kind detected in the solar system, spraying large amounts of water into space as it exits after its closest approach to the Sun in October 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the composition of comets and the materials present in the early solar system. NASA's SPHEREx near-infrared space observatory, launched in April 2025, recorded these findings during the comet's solar flyby.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observations by:</strong> NASA’s SPHEREx</li>
    <li><strong>Launch of SPHEREx:</strong> April 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Reported activity:</strong> Erupting water and carbon-rich materials</li>
    <li><strong>Lead researcher:</strong> Carey Lisse, Johns Hopkins University</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been a subject of interest since its detection. In October 2025, it made its closest approach to the Sun, which triggered significant activity. Observations from SPHEREx revealed that the comet began to erupt, releasing water and organic materials into space.</p>

<p>By December 2025, the comet was observed to be significantly brighter, indicating ongoing eruptions. Researchers noted that the Sun's energy had penetrated the comet, warming its ices and causing them to release chemicals that had been preserved for billions of years.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, after its close flyby of the Sun, causing it to significantly brighten,” said Carey Lisse, lead author of a recent study.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The comet has spent ages traversing interstellar space, being bombarded by highly energetic cosmic rays... but now that the Sun’s energy has had time to penetrate deep into the comet, the pristine ices below the surface are warming up and erupting,” said Phil Korngut, SPHEREx instrument scientist.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object recorded in the solar system, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique composition and behavior provide valuable data regarding the materials that may have existed in the early solar system, contributing to our understanding of cosmic evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from the SPHEREx observations to gain further insights into the materials released by 3I/ATLAS and their implications for understanding the origins of our solar system.</p>
