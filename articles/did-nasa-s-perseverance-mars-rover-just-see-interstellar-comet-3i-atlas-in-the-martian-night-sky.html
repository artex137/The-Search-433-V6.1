      <h2>Did NASA's Perseverance Mars rover just see interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in the Martian night sky?</h2>

<p>NASA's Perseverance Mars rover may have captured an image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS streaking across the Martian sky on Saturday, October 4. The image was taken by the rover's Right Navigation Camera (Navcam) during a time when the comet was making its closest approach to Mars, approximately 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) away.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the observation of one of the few known interstellar comets, highlighting the capabilities of NASA's Mars exploration missions. However, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has raised questions about the agency's ability to confirm the sighting and share further details.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: October 4, 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach distance of comet 3I/ATLAS: 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>NASA's workforce impacted: 15,000 employees, over 80% furloughed</li>
    <li>Comet's expected trajectory: Passing through the solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars. The following day, on October 4, the Perseverance rover captured an image that may depict the comet. NASA had previously announced plans to observe the comet using multiple spacecraft, including the Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO).</p>

<p>Due to the U.S. government shutdown, the confirmation of the comet's sighting and further communications from NASA remain uncertain.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I think Perseverance may have spotted interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS last night from Mars!” said Simeon Schmauß, who analyzed the data from the rover.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb from the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian noted, “The stripe in the Navcam image must have resulted from stacking hundreds of Navcam images over a total time interval of about 10 minutes.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as one of the few interstellar comets recorded. Previous observations have been made using the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, which have provided insights into the comet's composition.</p>

<p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has significantly affected NASA's operations, including the furloughing of a large portion of its workforce, which complicates the agency's ability to communicate and confirm scientific findings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's ability to continue observing 3I/ATLAS and to confirm the Perseverance rover's image depends on the resolution of the government shutdown. Further investigations and planned observations by various spacecraft remain uncertain at this time.</p>
