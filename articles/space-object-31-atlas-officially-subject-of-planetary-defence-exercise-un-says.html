      <h2>Space object 3I/ATLAS officially subject of planetary defence exercise, UN says</h2>

<p>The United Nations (UN) has confirmed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is officially part of a planetary defence exercise, running from November 27 to January 27 next year. The object, which is currently traversing the sky and emitting gas, poses no threat to Earth, according to the UN and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN).</p>

<p>This exercise aims to enhance international coordination, refine tracking methods, and prepare for future celestial events that could pose greater risks. The observation of 3I/ATLAS offers a unique opportunity for the IAWN community to conduct an observing exercise due to the object's prolonged visibility from Earth and significant interest within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation window: November 27, 2023 – January 27, 2024</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023, at approximately 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Initial sighting: July 2023 by a NASA-funded survey telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Previous observation: Last year through a network of telescopes</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is one of only three confirmed interstellar objects detected from Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed last year through a network of telescopes designed to identify potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. It reappeared in July 2023 after passing behind the sun and was then detected by a NASA-funded survey telescope in Chile. The UN has now included this object in a planetary defence exercise that will last two months.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While it poses no threat, comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and high interest to the scientific community,”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Professor Avi Loeb, a professor of astrophysics at Harvard University, suggested the object could be a “potential hostile alien threat” to our solar system, noting signs that it appears “intelligently directed.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The planetary defence exercise is an annual event aimed at improving global preparedness for possible celestial threats. Previous exercises have focused on asteroids and comets that could endanger Earth. The observation of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS is rare and provides valuable data for scientists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS throughout the observation window, gathering data that may inform future planetary defence strategies. No further details on upcoming exercises or findings have been disclosed.</p>
