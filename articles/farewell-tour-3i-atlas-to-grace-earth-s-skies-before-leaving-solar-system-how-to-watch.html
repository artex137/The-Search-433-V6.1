      <h2>Farewell tour: 3I/ATLAS to grace Earth’s skies before leaving solar system</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet named 3IATLAS has made its closest approach to the Sun and is set to reappear in Earth’s skies by mid-November. The comet, which came within 126 million miles (203 million km) of the Sun, will be visible during the predawn hours starting November 11, according to EarthSky.</p>

<p>The reappearance of 3IATLAS offers a final opportunity for astronomers and skywatchers to observe this cosmic visitor before it heads back into deep space. The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that the comet will pass safely at a distance of 168 million miles (270 million km) from Earth on December 19. Observers will need telescopes with at least an 8 to 10-inch aperture to view the comet, which will be visible through December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3IATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun on November 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will reappear in Earth’s skies around November 11, 2025.</li>
    <li>Best viewing time is 90 minutes before sunrise, looking eastward.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 168 million miles (270 million km).</li>
    <li>Viewing window extends through December 2025.</li>
    <li>3IATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and comet Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3IATLAS has traveled from deep space into our solar system, making its closest approach to the Sun on November 7, 2025. The comet will begin to reappear in the predawn sky by mid-November.</p>
<p>As it approaches Earth, astronomers will use data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and NASA’s upcoming SPHEREx mission to study its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “When it gets closest to the Sun, you get the most holistic view of the nucleus possible,” said Darryl Seligman, an astrophysicist at Michigan State University. “It shows you the original material it formed from — essentially, a snapshot of another solar system’s beginnings.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Physicist Brian Cox stated, “Just to be clear – given recent drivel online – Comet 3IATLAS is a comet, made of carbon dioxide and water ices and bits of other stuff. It is entirely natural in origin, its orbit is as expected, and it will whizz around the Sun and then disappear off into the galaxy again.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3IATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following the mysterious ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet Borisov in 2019. These objects provide scientists with insights into the building blocks of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>
<p>Comets like 3IATLAS are often described as “dirty snowballs,” composed of ice, dust, and rock. Their outgassing near the Sun allows astronomers to analyze their chemical composition, offering clues about their origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to prepare for the comet’s reappearance in mid-November. Observations will continue through December 2025, as scientists analyze data collected from telescopes and missions to better understand 3IATLAS and its interstellar origins.</p>
