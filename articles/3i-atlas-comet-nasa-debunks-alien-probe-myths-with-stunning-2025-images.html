      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet: NASA Debunks Alien Probe Myths with Stunning 2025 Images</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has captured global attention since its discovery on 1 July 2025, through Chile's ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado. NASA has released new images and data on 19 November 2025, dispelling rumors that it may be an alien probe.</p>

<p>The release of this data is significant as it addresses widespread speculation about the comet's origins and nature. Following a 43-day US government shutdown, NASA's findings have reignited interest in the scientific exploration of celestial bodies and the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July 2025, by ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Speed: 250,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Close approach to Mars: 3 October 2025, at 29 million km</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025, at 170 million miles</li>
    <li>NASA's data release: 19 November 2025</li>
    <li>Number of satellites involved in data collection: Over a dozen</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on 1 July 2025, with activity traced back to 7 May 2025 by NASA's TESS satellite. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory marked it as an interstellar object, the third of its kind after 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Observations from Hubble on 20 August 2025 indicated its nucleus size, and NASA's Psyche spacecraft tracked it on 8-9 September 2025.</p>

<p>Following a government shutdown from 1 October 2025, speculation about the comet intensified, with theories suggesting it could be an artificial probe. NASA's comprehensive data release on 19 November 2025 confirmed its cometary nature and dispelled these myths.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We certainly haven't seen any techno signatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” said Nicola Fox, NASA's Associate Administrator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It looks and behaves like a comet,” added Amit Kshatriya, highlighting ongoing scientific efforts to search for life beyond Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS reflects a growing fascination with interstellar objects since the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. The scientific community has been keen to explore the potential for life beyond our solar system, especially in light of recent advancements in observational technology.</p>

<p>Speculation surrounding extraterrestrial probes has often emerged during significant astronomical events, but this instance has been met with a strong scientific rebuttal from experts in the field.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth on 19 December 2025. The data collected will contribute to ongoing research into the characteristics of interstellar comets and the broader implications for the search for life in the universe.</p>
