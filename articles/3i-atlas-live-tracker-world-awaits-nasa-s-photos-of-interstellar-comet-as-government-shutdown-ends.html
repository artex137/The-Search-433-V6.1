      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: World awaits NASA's photos of interstellar comet as government shutdown ends</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is currently moving through the solar system, with astronomers worldwide observing its unusual features. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of the comet during its closest approach to Mars on October 2-3, 2023. The government shutdown has ended, allowing for the anticipated release of these images.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides an opportunity to better understand the comet, which has displayed complex jet structures, including two tails and one anti-tail. Scientists, including Harvard's Avi Loeb, are investigating the causes behind these phenomena. The release of NASA's photos is expected to shed light on the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> October 2-3, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> 30 million km</li>
    <li><strong>Observing Agencies:</strong> NASA, European Space Agency, China's space agency</li>
    <li><strong>Number of Tails:</strong> Two tails and one anti-tail</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2-3, 2023, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars, allowing the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to capture images of the comet. The government shutdown ended shortly thereafter, paving the way for NASA to release the captured images.</p>

<p>Astronomers around the globe have been observing 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible from Earth, with many using telescopes and binoculars to view the comet's features.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, has noted that the jets from 3I/ATLAS could potentially be caused by technological thrusters.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in our solar system. Its unique characteristics, particularly the presence of an anti-tail, have sparked significant interest among scientists and astronomers. The comet's behavior challenges conventional understandings of cometary structures.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to release the photos from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter soon, which will provide further insights into the structure and behavior of 3I/ATLAS. Scientists will continue to analyze the comet's jets and tails in the coming weeks.</p>
