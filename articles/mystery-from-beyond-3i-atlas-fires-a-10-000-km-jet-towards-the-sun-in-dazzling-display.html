      <h2>Mystery from beyond: 3I/ATLAS fires a 10,000-km Jet towards the Sun in dazzling display</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured detailed images of the interstellar object 3IATLAS, which is firing a powerful jet of gas and dust directly toward the Sun. This discovery was announced on October 15 via The Astronomer’s Telegram, marking a significant moment in the study of this rare celestial visitor, which is only the third interstellar object ever detected in our solar system.</p>

<p>The findings deepen scientific interest in 3IATLAS, discovered in late June and confirmed by NASA in early July. The object is believed to have originated in a distant, ancient star system and is estimated to measure between 5 and 11 km across, making it potentially the largest and oldest interstellar object observed to date. Authorities are monitoring its close approach to the Sun, with expectations of further study when it reappears in mid-November.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> Late June, confirmed in early July 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Announcement Date:</strong> October 15, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Close Approach to the Sun:</strong> Perihelion expected on October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Size:</strong> Between 5 and 11 km</li>
    <li><strong>Jet Length:</strong> Nearly 10,000 km</li>
    <li><strong>Observatories Involved:</strong> Teide Observatory in Spain, Two-meter Twin Telescope (TTT)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3IATLAS was discovered in late June 2023 and confirmed by NASA in early July. The object passed near Mars on October 3 and is expected to reach perihelion on October 29, 2023. The recent images revealing the jet were taken on August 2, 2023, at Teide Observatory, comprising 159 separate exposures.</p>

<p>Astronomers anticipate that 3IATLAS will reappear in mid-November, allowing for further observation of its jet and tail as it moves away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Jets are pointing to the sunward direction and the comet’s tail in the anti-solar direction,” explained Miquel Serra-Ricart, astrophysicist at Teide Observatory. “The phenomenon is entirely natural, driven by uneven heating as the object nears the Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery follows the detections of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2IBorisov in 2019, which have provided valuable insights into interstellar bodies. Each detection has expanded our understanding of celestial objects formed beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3IATLAS as it approaches perihelion on October 29 and will study its jet and tail when it becomes visible again in mid-November.</p>
