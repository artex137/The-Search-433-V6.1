      <h2>We Could Send A Mission That Could Intercept Comet 3I/ATLAS By 2085 – Here's How</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency has proposed a mission to intercept the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS by the year 2085. Discovered last year, 3I/ATLAS is distinct from previously observed interstellar objects due to its age and speed. Telescopes and spacecraft have studied it as it passed through the Solar System, but a dedicated mission to catch up with it has yet to be developed.</p>

<p>This mission matters because 3I/ATLAS represents a unique opportunity to study an object that may not return for a long time. The European Space Agency aims to launch a spacecraft named Comet Interceptor in late 2028 or early 2029, which will be stationed in orbit and ready to pursue a suitable comet or interstellar object detected nearby.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in 2022.</li>
<li>Proposed mission could intercept the comet by 2085.</li>
<li>Comet Interceptor is set to launch in late 2028 or early 2029.</li>
<li>Optimal launch time for an intercept mission is suggested as 2035.</li>
<li>Distance to 3I/ATLAS is 109 billion kilometers (68 billion miles).</li>
<li>Current focus is on the feasibility of a Solar Oberth maneuver.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2022, 3I/ATLAS was discovered and observed as it passed through the Solar System. In 2028 or 2029, the European Space Agency plans to launch the Comet Interceptor mission. Researchers propose that a follow-up mission could launch in 2035, utilizing a Solar Oberth maneuver to reach the comet by 2085.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“[3I/ATLAS] is probably more interesting than what we can imagine it to be because it's like a time capsule from a different era,” said Colin Wilson, European Space Agency Project Scientist for ExoMars and Mars Express.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the Solar System. Its unique characteristics have sparked interest in studying it up close, as it may provide insights into the early solar system. The mission proposal highlights the challenges of celestial mechanics, particularly the comet's retrograde orbit and high speed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to explore the feasibility of the proposed mission, focusing on the challenges of navigating to and studying 3I/ATLAS. Further studies will address the complexities of launching, maneuvering, and operating in deep space environments.</p>
