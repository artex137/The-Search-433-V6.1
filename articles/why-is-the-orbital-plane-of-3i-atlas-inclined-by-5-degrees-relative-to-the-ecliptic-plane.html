      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-05 11:23 UTC</p>

      <h2>Why is the Orbital Plane of 3I/ATLAS Inclined by 5 Degrees Relative to the Ecliptic Plane?</h2>

<p>On October 3, 2025, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS passed within 29 million kilometers from Mars. It is set to pass within 54 million kilometers from Jupiter on March 16, 2026. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This phenomenon raises questions about the nature and origin of 3I/ATLAS. Experts are analyzing its trajectory and anomalies to determine whether it is a natural object or the result of extraterrestrial technology. The implications of this investigation could enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their potential origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed 29 million kilometers from Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will pass 54 million kilometers from Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The probability of its near alignment with the ecliptic plane is 0.002.</li>
    <li>The probability of its arrival timing at the planets’ orbital radii is 0.0002.</li>
    <li>The combined likelihood of both coincidences is less than one in a million.</li>
    <li>The mass of 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be over 33 billion tons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars at a distance of 29 million kilometers. This event was significant due to its unusual orbital characteristics.</p>
<p>On March 16, 2026, the object is scheduled to pass within 54 million kilometers of Jupiter. Observations during these encounters may provide further insights into its composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS is technological in origin, then the fact that its mass is larger than 33 billion tons suggests that its senders have access to technologies far more advanced than humans possess,” said Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique among interstellar objects due to its significant mass and unusual trajectory. Previous studies of such objects have typically focused on their natural origins, making this case particularly noteworthy. The object has displayed seven anomalies related to its size, jet, composition, polarization, inclination, timing, and angular alignment with signals from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. Imaging and spectroscopy from seven spacecraft around Mars and two near Jupiter are expected to yield valuable data that may clarify the object's origin and nature.</p>
