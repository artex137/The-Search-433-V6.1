      <h2>Harvard Professor Accuses NASA of Ignoring Alien Probe Signs in Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard University physicist, has accused NASA of disregarding signs that may indicate the presence of an alien probe in comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Loeb's claims follow NASA's press conference on November 19, 2025, where the agency maintained that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, despite Loeb's assertions of anomalous data suggesting otherwise.</p>

<p>This controversy highlights the ongoing debate between mainstream astronomy and speculative theories regarding extraterrestrial life. NASA has defended its position, stating that multiple spacecraft have confirmed the comet's typical icy composition and have found no evidence of artificial origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Press conference held by NASA on November 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has outlined 12 anomalies related to the comet.</li>
    <li>Loeb's Medium post criticizing NASA was published shortly after the press conference.</li>
    <li>NASA's Associate Administrator is Amit Kshatriya.</li>
    <li>NASA's observations include data from the Lucy mission and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Following this, on November 19, 2025, NASA held a press conference where it confirmed the comet's natural characteristics. Shortly after, Avi Loeb published a Medium post criticizing NASA's findings and suggesting the presence of artificial origins for the comet.</p>

<p>Loeb has since pointed to various anomalies, including the comet's retrograde orbit and alignment with Earth's path, which he argues are statistically improbable. He has also compared the comet's behavior to that of ‘Oumuamua, another interstellar object he previously suggested could be alien technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “NASA’s press briefing was overly dismissive of data that could suggest alien origins for 3I/ATLAS,” said Avi Loeb in his Medium post. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Multiple spacecraft have captured images confirming 3I/ATLAS as a comet with typical icy composition,” stated Amit Kshatriya during the press conference. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Avi Loeb has faced scrutiny for his theories. His work on ‘Oumuamua in 2017 sparked similar debates within the scientific community. As head of Harvard’s Galileo Project, he advocates for systematic searches for alien artifacts and has called for a rating system for interstellar objects.</p>

<p>NASA has consistently emphasized that there is no evidence supporting claims of artificiality in 3I/ATLAS, while experts from the SETI Institute have focused on natural explanations to prevent public panic.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest pass to Earth, further observations from missions like Lucy are expected to provide more data. Loeb continues to call for transparency in data sharing from NASA, arguing it could foster innovation and exploration in the field of astronomy.</p>
