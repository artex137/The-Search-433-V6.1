      <h2>Far-flung comets may be erupting metals due to volatile chemical compounds</h2>

<p>Recent observations have revealed new insights about comet 3I/ATLAS and its unusual metallic composition. Cyrielle Opitom, an astronomer at the University of Edinburgh, has been involved in studies using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to investigate the comet's characteristics.</p>

<p>This research matters because it may help scientists understand the origins and evolution of comets, as well as the processes that lead to the eruption of metals from these celestial bodies. Astronomers are exploring the possibility that nickel is embedded within volatile chemical compounds that can transform into gases, potentially carrying metals into the comet's coma.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed using the VLT and JWST.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at approximately 220,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of the comet may range from 442 metres to 1.6 kilometres in length.</li>
    <li>The comet could trace its origins back to a cluster of stars around eight billion years old.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may be one of the oldest objects in the galaxy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been under observation as astronomers seek to understand its unique properties. Recent studies have highlighted the potential presence of nickel within volatile compounds, indicating that the comet may erupt metals as it travels through space.</p>

<p>Additionally, researchers have noted that the comet's trajectory suggests it could originate from an ancient cluster of stars, further complicating its background and significance in the study of cosmic history.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The ongoing mystery surrounding the eruption of metals from these celestial bodies is intriguing,” said Cyrielle Opitom, highlighting the complexities of 3I/ATLAS’s composition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This comet not only provides insight into its original planetary system but also yields clues about the stellar ancestors that contributed to the formation of the host star,” noted Cordiner regarding the implications of the comet's findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are generally considered ancient relics from the solar system's formation over 4.6 billion years ago. The study of 3I/ATLAS contributes to the broader understanding of these celestial bodies and their roles in the history of the galaxy.</p>

<p>Previous observations of comets have shown their potential to carry clues about the early solar system, but 3I/ATLAS presents a unique case due to its possible origins from an older star cluster.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, expecting to gather more data that could shed light on its characteristics and origins. Further studies will focus on understanding the comet's composition and the implications for our knowledge of cosmic evolution.</p>
