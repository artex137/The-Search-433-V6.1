      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Update: NASA Data Unveils Dramatic Glow From 8-Billion-Year-Old Visitor</h2>

<p>A massive interstellar comet, known as 3I/ATLAS, has performed a dazzling transformation during its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025. Discovered on 1 July 2025 by Larry Denneau using the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, the comet has become a significant focus of astronomical observation.</p>

<p>This event is important as it marks the first time an interstellar comet has exhibited such dramatic changes in brightness, capturing the attention of both amateur and professional astronomers. NASA and other agencies have mobilized advanced observational tools to monitor the comet's unique characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discovered: 1 July 2025, by Larry Denneau in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
<li>Closest approach to the Sun: 29 October 2025.</li>
<li>Peak brightness: Magnitude 9, observed just before perihelion.</li>
<li>Current speed: Approximately 130,000 miles per hour.</li>
<li>Distance at closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025, 170 million miles.</li>
<li>Notable observations: Detected by GOES-19 satellite and NASA's PUNCH mission.</li>
<li>Composition: Carbon dioxide outnumbers water ice by a ratio of 8-to-1.</li>
<li>Next close-up observation: Expected in March 2026 by spacecraft orbiting Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered during the ATLAS survey in Chile. The comet reached its perihelion on 29 October 2025, during which it briefly disappeared from view of ground-based observers. On 18 October 2025, Thai astronomer Worachate Boonplod noted a surge in brightness, comparable to nearby stars. By 28 October 2025, researchers reported a significant increase in luminosity before the comet reached perihelion.</p>
<p>NASA's PUNCH mission and the SOHO observatory tracked the comet's progress until 26 October 2025. The Perseverance rover on Mars captured an image of 3I/ATLAS during its close pass on 3 October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The brightness of the object was comparable to nearby stars,” said Worachate Boonplod in a dispatch to the Comets Mailing List. “It's moving from left to right across the field.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its unprecedented speed and trajectory, with an eccentricity of approximately 6.14. This behavior sets it apart from previous interstellar visitors, such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet's unique characteristics have sparked interest and speculation in both the scientific community and popular culture.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will monitor its path closely. The comet is expected to be visible in the constellation Cancer as it moves away from the Sun, and spacecraft near Jupiter will provide additional observations in March 2026.</p>
