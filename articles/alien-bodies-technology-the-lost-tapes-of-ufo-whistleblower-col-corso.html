      <h2>Alien Bodies & Technology: The Lost Tapes of UFO Whistleblower Col. Corso</h2>

<p>Congress has begun reviewing legislation aimed at disclosing materials, craft, and bodies linked to UFO crashes, as highlighted in the latest episode of the podcast WEAPONIZED with Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp. This discussion revisits the claims made by Colonel Phillip Corso, who alleged that the U.S. military has engaged in reverse engineering alien technology since the 1947 Roswell incident.</p>

<p>This matter gains significance as it reflects ongoing efforts by lawmakers to address public interest in UFO phenomena. The current wave of whistleblowers is not new; previous disclosures have raised questions about government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Podcast episode title: "Alien Bodies & Technology - The Lost Tapes Of UFO Whistleblower Col. Corso"</li>
    <li>Released on: not disclosed</li>
    <li>Hosts: Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp</li>
    <li>Key figure: Colonel Phillip Corso, former Army Intelligence official</li>
    <li>Corso's book: "The Day After Roswell," published in 1997</li>
    <li>Previous interviews conducted by the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS)</li>
    <li>Unreleased recordings of Corso's interviews exist</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1997, Colonel Phillip Corso published "The Day After Roswell," which detailed his experiences with alien technology recovered from crash sites. Five years prior to this publication, Corso provided his firsthand accounts to George Knapp and participated in interviews with NIDS. These recordings, however, have not been made public.</p>

<p>The recent podcast episode revisits these tapes, offering insights into Corso's assertions about the military's secretive handling of alien technology and materials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The tech came from crashes near Roswell New Mexico,” stated Corso, emphasizing the military's role in disseminating alien technology to private corporations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first instance of military personnel disclosing information about UFOs. Corso's revelations in the late 1990s coincided with a growing interest in UAP, leading to subsequent investigations and inquiries from both the public and Congress. The current legislative discussions echo past efforts to uncover the truth behind reported UFO encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue its examination of the proposed legislation aimed at increasing transparency regarding UFO-related materials. The outcomes of these discussions could influence future disclosures from military and government agencies.</p>
