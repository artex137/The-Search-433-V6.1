      <h2>Astronomers Pinpoint 3I/ATLAS's Path Based on Data from Mars</h2>

<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers at the Gemini South Observatory observed 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object ever recorded in our Solar System. Since its discovery, researchers have worked to determine its trajectory using data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), which is currently orbiting Mars. This collaboration has improved predictions about the comet's path and has implications for planetary defense.</p>

<p>Understanding the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is crucial for assessing potential threats to Earth. According to the ESA, accurate tracking of such objects enables scientists to monitor and predict their paths, aiding in planetary defense efforts. The comet's closest approach to Mars occurred in October 2025, providing a unique opportunity to gather data from multiple angles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS observed on July 1, 2025, at Gemini South Observatory.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 2025, within approximately 29 million km.</li>
    <li>Comet traveling at speeds of up to 250,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Scheduled to pass Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million km.</li>
    <li>Trajectory improved by a factor of ten using TGO data.</li>
    <li>ESA's Near-Earth Object Coordination Center (NEOCC) led the trajectory analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first observed 3I/ATLAS at the Gemini South Observatory. The comet's trajectory was initially calculated using ground-based telescopes. In October 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars, allowing the ExoMars TGO and Mars Express to capture images from a new perspective. By December 19, 2025, the comet will pass Earth at a safe distance.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This represents a first for astronomers: the first time data from a spacecraft orbiting another planet were used to triangulate the position and trajectory of a celestial object,” said a representative from ESA’s NEOCC.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects is a growing field within astronomy. 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following previous discoveries that have sparked interest in understanding their origins and compositions. The collaboration between ground-based and space-based telescopes marks a significant advancement in tracking such celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ESA will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS with the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), which is en route to study Jupiter's moons. Data from JUICE is expected to be released next year. Additionally, the ESA is developing the Comet Interceptor spacecraft, set to launch by 2029, to further investigate comets and enhance monitoring capabilities for near-Earth objects.</p>
