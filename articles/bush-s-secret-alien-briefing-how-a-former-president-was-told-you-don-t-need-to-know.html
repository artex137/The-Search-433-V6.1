      <h2>Bush's Secret Alien Briefing: How a Former President Was Told 'You Don't Need to Know'</h2>

<p>A new documentary claims that former US President George H.W. Bush was informed of an alleged alien contact at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico in 1964. The film, titled The Age of Disclosure, features testimony from astrophysicist Eric Davis, who asserts that Bush confirmed details of a face-to-face encounter between military officials and a non-human entity.</p>

<p>The documentary raises questions about the level of knowledge US leaders possess regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). It suggests that even sitting presidents may not have access to critical information about such incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary: The Age of Disclosure</li>
    <li>Location of incident: Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico</li>
    <li>Year of alleged contact: 1964</li>
    <li>Testimony from: Eric Davis, astrophysicist</li>
    <li>Claim: Three spacecraft were seen approaching the base</li>
    <li>Allegation: Bush was told he did not have a 'need-to-know'</li>
    <li>Related claims: Alien remains recovered in Russia in 1988</li>
    <li>Physical injuries reported by military personnel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to the documentary:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In 1964, three spacecraft reportedly approached Holloman Air Force Base.</li>
    <li>An extraterrestrial being allegedly emerged and interacted with military and CIA personnel.</li>
    <li>In 2003, Bush reportedly discussed the incident with Eric Davis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Bush sought further details but was denied access, being told he did not have a 'need-to-know'.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There are multiple types of extraterrestrials reported, although specifics were not provided.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Secrecy surrounding UAPs raises concerns about accountability.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary outlines what it calls the 'Legacy Program', a top-secret initiative involving the CIA, the US Air Force, the Department of Energy, and private defence contractors. This program is alleged to have dealt with the retrieval of crashed vehicles and alien bodies. The film also highlights repeated reports of unidentified objects near nuclear facilities, emphasizing the need for serious investigation into these incidents.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Director Dan Farah hopes the documentary will advance the UFO disclosure movement, encouraging future leaders to acknowledge the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The absence of new physical evidence continues to prompt debate within both sceptical and believing communities regarding government transparency on the issue.</p>
