      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas: Five facts to know about interstellar object</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is currently traversing our solar system, exciting astronomers and space enthusiasts alike, according to NASA and the European Space Agency. These organizations are documenting the comet's path and providing information to the public about this interstellar visitor.</p>

<p>This comet, believed to be over 7 billion years old, is significant as it is the oldest comet ever observed. Authorities are closely monitoring its journey and studying its unique features, which may offer insights into the composition of comets from other solar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> 3I/Atlas is at least 7 billion years old, making it twice as old as Earth.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> The comet travels at approximately 210,000 kilometers per hour (130,487 miles per hour).</li>
    <li><strong>Rarity:</strong> It is only the third interstellar comet recorded, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li><strong>Unique emissions:</strong> 3I/Atlas emits hydroxyl (OH) at a rate of 40 kilograms per second, even when far from the Sun.</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> At its closest, the comet will be 240 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> 3I/Atlas cannot be seen with the naked eye and requires a telescope for observation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been observed as it travels through the solar system. The comet's age and unique characteristics have been documented by various scientific bodies, including NASA and the European Space Agency. The comet reached a significant distance from the Sun, where it continued to produce hydroxyl emissions, surprising scientists with its behavior.</p>

<p>Experts, including Jason Wright from Penn State University, have expressed excitement over the comet's unique properties and its implications for understanding interstellar objects. The comet's closest approach to Earth is anticipated, but no threat has been identified.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is only the third such interstellar comet we've ever been able to study, and planetary scientists are super excited to learn about what comets in other solar systems are like,” said Jason Wright, professor of astronomy and astrophysics.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, researcher at Auburn University. “‘Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn’t expect it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/Atlas, only two other interstellar comets have been recorded, highlighting the rarity of such events. The observation of these comets has provided valuable data for scientists studying the formation and composition of comets in various solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its journey, scientists will monitor its path and emissions. Further studies will aim to uncover the reasons behind its unusual behavior and the implications for understanding other interstellar objects.</p>
