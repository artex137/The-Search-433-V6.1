      <h2>3I/ATLAS Image from $500 Telescope Captures ‘Sharp-Edged Ship’ Surrounded by Blue Halo</h2>

<p>A 3I/ATLAS image captured by Canadian astrophotographer Paul Craggs using a Dwarf 3 smart telescope has sparked intense online debate. The image, released recently, shows what many users believe to be one of the clearest views of the interstellar comet, which is set to be closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This image has reignited speculation about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which entered the solar system from beyond known space. The buzz follows a NASA live webcast on November 19, 2025, where the agency unveiled previously unreleased images of 3I/ATLAS taken by multiple space-based assets. However, many stargazers expressed disappointment over the quality of NASA's visuals, making Craggs' image a prominent talking point.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of NASA webcast:</strong> November 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 167 million miles or 270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope used:</strong> Dwarf 3 smart telescope, priced around USD 500</li>
    <li><strong>Photographer:</strong> Paul Craggs, Canadian astrophotographer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA held a live webcast unveiling new images of 3I/ATLAS. The quality of these images was criticized by the public, leading to a surge of interest in Craggs' image captured with a budget telescope.</p>
<p>Following the release of Craggs' image, social media users reacted quickly, discussing its unusual appearance and comparing it to NASA's visuals. The image went viral within hours.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Instead of the uneven coma and long tail expected from a normal comet, it appears structured, clean, and sharply illuminated,” commented one user on social media.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The new 3I/Atlas from Paul Craggs... Looks like a ship structure under the glow,” another user stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system, detected by the ATLAS survey. The comet has drawn global attention due to its unusual trajectory and appearance, leading to various interpretations, including conspiracy theories regarding its nature.</p>
<p>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has previously criticized NASA's handling of information regarding 3I/ATLAS, highlighting 13 anomalies associated with the comet's behavior that defy typical cometary models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA officials have stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and is following a typical interstellar trajectory. Ongoing discussions and analyses regarding the comet's characteristics and implications are expected to continue in the scientific community.</p>
