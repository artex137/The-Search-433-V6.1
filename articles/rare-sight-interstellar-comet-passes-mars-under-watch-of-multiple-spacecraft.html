      <h2>Rare Sight: Interstellar Comet Passes Mars Under Watch of Multiple Spacecraft</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS has passed near Mars on October 3, 2025. The comet, which originated from outside the solar system, approached Mars at a distance of approximately 18 million miles (29 million kilometers). No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant for scientists as it provides a rare opportunity to study materials from beyond our solar system. Multiple spacecraft in orbit around Mars, including NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, and the Perseverance rover, have been monitoring the comet's journey to gather data on its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory shows it traveling at over 193,000 mph (310,000 kph) as it approaches Mars.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus size ranges from as small as 440 meters (1,444 feet) to as large as 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles).</li>
    <li>NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft are collaborating to observe the comet.</li>
    <li>Early observations indicate the comet has a coma and tail, typical signs of comet activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS survey in Chile. Following this, they traced its earlier images back to June 14, 2025, to confirm its path. As the comet approached Mars, it accelerated under the Sun's gravity, reaching speeds over 193,000 mph (310,000 kph) during its flyby on October 3, 2025.</p>

<p>Multiple spacecraft, including NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Perseverance rover, monitored the comet's trajectory and collected data on its composition and activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This interstellar visitor gives us a chance to peek into materials from outside our solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson. “We are excited to learn how other planetary systems form.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike typical comets, interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS follow hyperbolic trajectories, meaning they are not bound to the Sun and pass through the solar system before continuing on their journey through space.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar visitors have provided valuable insights into the composition of materials from outside our solar system. The observations of 3I/ATLAS may help refine future models for tracking and studying such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey away from the solar system, scientists will analyze the data collected during its flyby. This research may offer insights into the building blocks of life and improve observation methods for future interstellar objects.</p>
