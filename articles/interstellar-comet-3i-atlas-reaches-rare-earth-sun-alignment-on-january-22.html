      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaches rare Earth-Sun alignment on January 22</h2>

<p>On January 22, 2026, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will align itself with the Earth-Sun axis at a phase angle of 0.69 degrees. This alignment presents a unique opportunity for astronomers to study a phenomenon known as the "opposition surge" for its dust. The event is expected to last from January 19 to January 26, 2026, as the comet travels with phase angles smaller than 2 degrees.</p>

<p>This alignment is significant because it allows for the measurement of the comet's albedo, structure, and composition, which may not be possible for decades. Authorities, including astronomers from Harvard and Padova Observatory, have urged observers with suitable telescopes to take advantage of this rare event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Alignment date: January 22, 2026, at 13:00 UTC.</li>
    <li>Phase angle: 0.69 degrees.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: 3.33 astronomical units (AU).</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 2.35 AU on January 22.</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>Interstellar velocity: 57.7 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Duration of favorable alignment: January 19 to January 26, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. A study authored by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb and Mauro Barbieri of Padova Observatory predicted its rare alignment with the Earth-Sun axis on January 22, 2026. This alignment will allow scientists to measure the opposition surge effect for the comet's dust.</p>

<p>The comet will maintain a phase angle smaller than 2 degrees for a week, starting January 19, 2026. This period is critical for observations and measurements of the comet's properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Here’s hoping that many observers with access to suitable telescopes will take advantage of the extraordinary fortune that we are about to have through the rare alignment of 3I/ATLAS with the Sun-Earth direction."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare celestial objects that provide insights into materials originating from other stellar systems. Previous interstellar objects like 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have been studied, but they did not exhibit the same favorable conditions for observation as 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>Only one comet, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, has shown a well-measured opposition surge, which was observed by the Rosetta spacecraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the alignment approaches, astronomers are preparing to conduct observations of 3I/ATLAS. Following the alignment, the comet is expected to lose brightness, making it more challenging to observe without larger telescopes.</p>
