      <h2>ISRO captures rare and close-up image of fast-moving interstellar comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has released a rare, close-up view of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from its Mount Abu telescope, taken between November 12 and 15, 2025. The images show a compact, near-circular coma consistent with typical comet characteristics, according to ISRO's Physical Research Laboratory.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it helps scientists refine models of the comet's activity and trajectory. ISRO’s imaging and spectroscopy efforts complement data from NASA missions, allowing researchers to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the comet's behaviour as it passes through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed from November 12 to 15, 2025.</li>
<li>ISRO's Mount Abu telescope captured false-colour images and a dawn spectrum.</li>
<li>The comet is exhibiting a near-circular coma and classic molecular bands.</li>
<li>NASA has utilized twelve assets to track and analyze the comet.</li>
<li>The comet is expected to approach Earth at a safe distance of 170 million miles in mid-December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 12-15, 2025, ISRO conducted observations of 3I/ATLAS, capturing images and spectra that reveal its coma characteristics. The agency released these findings on November 19, 2025, highlighting that the comet behaves like a typical active body. Meanwhile, NASA has been compiling data from multiple missions to track the comet's path and activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
“The images show a near-circular coma... The result shows prominent emission features commonly seen in Solar system comets - the CN, C2 and C3 bands in the shorter wavelength side of the spectrum,” ISRO stated in a post.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
“We were quick to be able to say, ‘Yup, it definitely behaves like a comet’,” said NASA’s Nicky Fox during a November 19 briefing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
“This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations of 3I/ATLAS have shown it to be chemically interesting, with a CO₂-heavy composition. NASA’s multi-mission approach has been crucial in tracking the comet through various geometries, particularly during times when Earth-based telescopes faced solar glare.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ISRO will continue to collect ground data, while NASA will provide calibrated image sets. Scientists will compare coma profiles and dust-to-gas behaviour as the comet moves further into the solar system.</p>
