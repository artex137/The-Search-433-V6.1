      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-23 23:41 UTC</p>

      <h2>Where will 3I/ATLAS be on October 29?</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at approximately 1.4 astronomical units, or about 210 million kilometers, according to NASA. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks a key moment for scientists and astronomers who will track the comet's movement and study its composition. Ground-based telescopes will observe its water release, enhancing understanding of interstellar bodies. NASA and ESA have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: 1.4 astronomical units (210 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: approximately 1.8 astronomical units (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Ground-based observations will continue until September 2025</li>
    <li>Comet reappears for observation by early December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by scientists in Chile using the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope. At that time, it was approximately 670 million kilometers from Earth.</p>
<p>As it moves closer to the Sun, the comet will pass inside the orbit of Mars around October 30, 2025. Ground-based telescopes will track its activity until September, after which it will be too close to the Sun for observation.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to reappear on the other side of the Sun by early December 2025, allowing for renewed observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is an important discovery that helps scientists study objects from outside the solar system,” said Darryl Seligman, a physics and astronomy professor at Michigan State University.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS will stay far from Earth, posing no threat,” NASA officials stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object discovered passing through our solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic orbit confirms that it originates outside the solar system.</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that 3I/ATLAS has a high carbon dioxide-to-water ratio and releases about 40 kg of water per second, contributing valuable data for future research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach to the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will be unobservable until it reappears in early December 2025. Astronomers worldwide plan to continue tracking the comet as it moves away from the Sun, further exploring its unique properties and significance.</p>
