      <h2>Mars spacecraft observes comet from outside our solar system</h2>

<p>This summer, scientists have observed a rare comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, as it travels through the solar system after entering from interstellar space. The University of Colorado Boulder research team has captured images of the comet using NASA’s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft, which is currently orbiting Mars. Observations occurred over a 10-day period in September and October 2025.</p>

<p>The significance of these observations lies in the fact that 3I/ATLAS is only the third comet from outside our solar system that researchers have been able to track. The MAVEN team hopes to gather valuable data about the comet's composition and behavior as it approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS travels at approximately 220,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to measure up to 5.6 kilometers across.</li>
    <li>MAVEN captured images from September 2025 to October 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 267 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>MAVEN was launched in 2014 to study Mars' upper atmosphere.</li>
    <li>The mission is managed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, 3I/ATLAS passed Mars at a distance of approximately 30 million kilometers. At that time, Earth was located on the opposite side of the sun, blocking our view of the comet. MAVEN was strategically positioned to observe the comet, and the team began collecting images using the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrometer (IUVS).</p>

<p>NASA released the images and data from MAVEN and other spacecraft in November 2025. Researchers continue to analyze this data to better understand the comet's properties and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is the biggest and brightest object from outside our solar system that’s ever been observed,” said Shannon Curry, a planetary scientist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at CU Boulder, who leads the MAVEN mission.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Every measurement we can make of this comet is precious and helps to open up new understanding of interstellar objects,” said Justin Deighan, a research scientist at LASP and deputy principal investigator for MAVEN.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Everything about this object tells us it’s a comet,” said Shannon Curry. “There’s nothing to indicate that its trajectory, size and evolution could be produced in any other way.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third comet identified as coming from interstellar space. Previous observations have provided limited data, making the current findings from MAVEN particularly valuable. The MAVEN mission has been operational since 2014 and continues to contribute to our understanding of Mars and beyond.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The MAVEN team will continue to analyze the data obtained from the comet and prepare for its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. This analysis may yield critical insights into the composition of interstellar comets and their behavior within our solar system.</p>
