      <h2>Psyche Observes Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA’s Psyche spacecraft has captured new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, the third object and the second comet confirmed to originate outside the Solar System. The observations took place over eight hours on September 8 and 9, 2025, when the comet was approximately 53 million km (33 million miles) from the spacecraft.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides essential data about the comet's trajectory and its characteristics. 3I/ATLAS, discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025, has the most dynamically extreme orbit of any object recorded in the Solar System. NASA aims to refine the understanding of such objects to enhance tracking and monitoring efforts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Psyche spacecraft captured images of 3I/ATLAS on September 8 and 9, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope.</li>
    <li>The comet reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was approximately 53 million km (33 million miles) from Psyche during the observations.</li>
    <li>The observations lasted for eight hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered in Chile by the ATLAS survey telescope. The comet's orbit has been noted for its extreme dynamics, making it a unique object of study.</p>
<p>NASA's Psyche spacecraft conducted observations of 3I/ATLAS over two days, September 8 and 9, 2025. These observations provided critical data regarding the comet's trajectory and its faint coma.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS is set to reach its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, which will further inform scientists about its path and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Captured by the mission’s multispectral imager, these observations help us refine the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS,” members of the Psyche team said in a statement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While the comet poses no threat to Earth, NASA’s space missions help support the agency’s ongoing commitment to find, track, and better understand solar system objects,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation of 3I/ATLAS adds to NASA's ongoing efforts to monitor celestial objects beyond the Solar System. The agency has a history of tracking such objects to enhance safety and understanding of their behaviours.</p>
<p>Previous missions have contributed to the knowledge of comets and asteroids, allowing for better predictions of their orbits and potential impacts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the data collected from the Psyche spacecraft to refine its understanding of 3I/ATLAS's trajectory and characteristics as it moves through the Solar System.</p>
