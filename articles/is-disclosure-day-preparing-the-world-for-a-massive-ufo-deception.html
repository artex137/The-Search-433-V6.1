      <h2>Is ‘Disclosure Day’ Preparing the World for a Massive UFO Deception?</h2>

<p>Longtime researcher and filmmaker L.A. Marzulli has raised concerns about the implications of the film <strong>Disclosure Day</strong>, which he believes signals a significant shift in the conversation surrounding UFOs. In a reaction video, Marzulli stated that the global push for disclosure is occurring “in real time.” He emphasizes that the film presents “full disclosure” as a moral imperative, suggesting a need for the public to know the truth about UFOs.</p>

<p>This issue matters as it reflects a growing trend in media and government discussions surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Marzulli argues that the framing of disclosure in the film is intentional and could shape public perception and belief about non-human intelligences. He questions the nature of the truth that will be revealed and warns of the potential consequences of such revelations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
