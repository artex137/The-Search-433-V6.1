      <h2>Lightning Creates UFO-Like Plasmoids in Scientific Breakthrough</h2>

<p>Scientists have confirmed that lightning can spontaneously create glowing spheres known as plasmoids, according to a recent study. This phenomenon occurs during thunderstorms, where glowing orbs reportedly drift through streets and power lines, resembling objects often associated with UFO sightings. The findings are based on a growing body of peer-reviewed experiments.</p>

<p>This research matters because it offers a scientific explanation for many historical UFO encounters. Authorities have logged hundreds of reports each year, but the nature of these sightings has remained largely unexplained. The new insights suggest that many of these phenomena may stem from atmospheric plasma rather than extraterrestrial sources.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lightning can create floating fireballs known as plasmoids.</li>
    <li>Reports of ball lightning have been logged by police and military authorities.</li>
    <li>A major scientific book now includes a chapter on UFO-like events tied to lightning.</li>
    <li>Experiments at the Heavy Ion Collider in New York produced fireballs 300 times hotter than the Sun.</li>
    <li>Plasmoids can self-assemble under specific conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers have conducted experiments revealing the process of plasmoid formation. Under the right conditions, electricity can organize chaos into structured plasmoids. In one significant experiment at the Heavy Ion Collider, beams of gold nuclei were collided at near light speed, creating a fireball of plasma that lasted longer than the impact itself.</p>

<p>Over the years, numerous eyewitness accounts of ball lightning have been recorded, often during thunderstorms. These glowing orbs have baffled scientists and the public alike, leading to speculation about their origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Taken together, the evidence suggests that many historical UFO encounters may have been misidentified plasmoids born from lightning, plasma or extreme energy events,” a researcher stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Ball lightning has puzzled witnesses for generations, with many reports describing silent, glowing spheres that appear and vanish rapidly. The new research may provide clarity on these longstanding mysteries, linking them to natural atmospheric phenomena rather than extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations are expected to explore the implications of these findings on our understanding of atmospheric phenomena and their potential links to historical UFO sightings.</p>
