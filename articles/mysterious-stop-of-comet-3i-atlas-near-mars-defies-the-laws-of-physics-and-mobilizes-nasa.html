      <h2>Mysterious stop of comet 3I/Atlas near Mars defies the laws of physics and mobilizes NASA</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has perplexed the global astronomical community with its unexpected stop during a close passage to Mars in October 2025. The comet, which was approximately 27 million kilometers from the red planet, experienced a complete halt in its movement for several days, an event documented by multiple NASA observatories and probes.</p>

<p>This anomalous behavior has significant implications for our understanding of celestial mechanics. NASA has mobilized its resources to analyze the data collected during the comet's immobility, as scientists seek to understand the forces at play that allowed the comet to stop in a hyperbolic trajectory, which typically does not permit such behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas stopped its movement near Mars in October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was about 27 million kilometers from Mars during the stoppage.</li>
    <li>The event lasted several days and was recorded by NASA observatories.</li>
    <li>Data collected include spectral analyses and images from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and Perseverance rover.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus has an estimated diameter between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, comet 3I/Atlas approached Mars and unexpectedly stopped moving. This stoppage lasted several days and was confirmed by data from NASA's observatories. After resuming its trajectory, the comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>The NASA team conducted rigorous checks to rule out any instrumental failure, confirming the event through triangulated data from multiple sources. The analysis revealed that the stoppage challenged existing principles of conservation of energy and angular momentum.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The event was real. The comet remained nearly static for a significant period, which is unprecedented in our observations of celestial bodies,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The temporary immobility of 3I/Atlas represents a fundamental anomaly in the study of hyperbolic trajectories. Historically, celestial bodies on such paths have not exhibited the ability to halt their movement. This event has prompted scientists to reconsider the role of non-gravitational forces in deep space.</p>

<p>Previous studies have primarily focused on gravitational interactions, often overlooking the potential impact of other forces. The unique characteristics of 3I/Atlas provide an opportunity to explore these new avenues of research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the data collected from the comet, with ongoing investigations into the forces that caused its temporary stop. The findings are expected to influence future orbital simulation models and enhance planetary defense systems, ensuring more accurate predictions of celestial objects approaching Earth.</p>
