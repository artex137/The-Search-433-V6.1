      <h2>Pakistani Defence Minister's Response Raises Concerns Over Alleged Missile Test</h2>

<p>Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has sparked alarm by avoiding questions about an alleged secret hypersonic missile test during a live interview on Samaa TV on Friday, October 28, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this incident.</p>

<p>This situation has drawn significant attention from defence experts and the public. Authorities are now facing scrutiny over whether Pakistan has conducted a covert missile test. Asif's ambiguous response has prompted speculation about the country's military capabilities and transparency.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event took place on October 28, 2025.</li>
    <li>Location: Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan.</li>
    <li>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif appeared on Samaa TV.</li>
    <li>Residents reported seeing a strange cloud formation prior to sunrise.</li>
    <li>Pakistan Meteorological Department identified the cloud as a rare lenticular formation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 28, 2025, at approximately 5:40 AM, residents in Quetta and surrounding areas observed a saucer-shaped cloud formation. This phenomenon lasted for about 20 minutes before dissipating. Later that day, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif was questioned about a possible hypersonic missile test during a live television interview, where he advised viewers to "ask such things in private."</p>

<p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department later explained that the observed cloud was a lenticular cloud, a rare atmospheric phenomenon that can resemble UFOs. Despite this explanation, Asif's avoidance of the question has led to increased speculation about the military's activities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Now don't ask all these questions. Ask such things in private," said Defence Minister Khawaja Asif during the interview.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "The unusual formation seen over Quetta was a rare lenticular cloud," stated the Pakistan Meteorological Department.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Lenticular clouds are known for their unusual shapes and can often be mistaken for unidentified flying objects. The UK’s Met Office has noted that these clouds form when stable air flows over mountains. This incident follows previous claims by defence analysts regarding Pakistan's development of advanced missile technology, raising further questions about military transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to face continued scrutiny as analysts and the public seek clarity on the Defence Minister's statements and the alleged missile test. Investigations into the events surrounding the cloud formation and any potential military implications may follow.</p>
