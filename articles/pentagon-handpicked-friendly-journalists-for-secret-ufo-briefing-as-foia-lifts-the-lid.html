      <h2>Pentagon Handpicked Friendly Journalists for Secret UFO Briefing as FOIA Lifts the Lid</h2>

<p>The Pentagon has restricted media access to a briefing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) held on 6 March 2024, according to newly released documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Only a select group of journalists from major news outlets were invited to this event, raising concerns about transparency in government communications regarding UAPs.</p>

<p>The release of these documents highlights the Pentagon's efforts to control the narrative around UAPs, which have garnered significant public interest. The briefing was part of a congressionally mandated review of U.S. government UAP programs and suggests a continued emphasis on media management by the Department of Defense.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of briefing: 6 March 2024</li>
    <li>Event type: Invite-only, embargoed briefing</li>
    <li>Participants: Selected journalists from major outlets</li>
    <li>Notable outlets: The New York Times, CNN, Politico, Task & Purpose, The Washington Post</li>
    <li>Conditions: Attendance was 'OFF THE RECORD / FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY / NOT FOR DAYBOOKS'</li>
    <li>Invitation restrictions: One representative per outlet, non-transferable</li>
    <li>FOIA findings: Single responsive invitation record released</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 6 March 2024, the Pentagon conducted a tightly controlled briefing regarding the Department of Defense's Historical Record Report Volume 1 (HRRV1). Invitations were sent to select journalists with strict conditions on confidentiality. Participants were required to agree to an embargo until the report's public release two days later.</p>

<p>The FOIA documents reveal that the Pentagon only located one responsive invitation record, indicating a narrow scope of information management. This approach contrasts with typical Pentagon briefings that often allow broader media access.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The selective briefing strategy has drawn scrutiny because the public's right to information about unexplained phenomena is weighed against tight Pentagon control,” said Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The NDAA mandate for the Historical Record Report reflects bipartisan interest in oversight of UAP programs. However, the Pentagon's selective media strategy raises concerns about transparency and public access to information regarding unexplained phenomena.</p>

<p>Historically, the Pentagon has maintained a level of secrecy around UAPs, with the recent FOIA documents providing a glimpse into its media curation practices. The limited access granted to specific journalists underscores a trend of controlled information dissemination within the Department of Defense.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the unclassified report is anticipated, questions remain about the extent of information available to the public and whether further investigations will examine the Pentagon's media strategies and transparency practices regarding UAPs.</p>
