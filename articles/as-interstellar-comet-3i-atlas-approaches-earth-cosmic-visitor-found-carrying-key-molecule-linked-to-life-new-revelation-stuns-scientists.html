      <h2>As interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, cosmic visitor found carrying key molecule linked to life. New revelation stuns scientists</h2>

<p>As interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists have discovered that the comet carries a key molecule linked to the origins of life. This revelation has emerged as the comet nears its closest approach to Earth, scheduled for March 2024.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it could provide insights into the building blocks of life on Earth and beyond. Researchers from several space agencies, including NASA and ESA, are studying the comet to understand its composition and the implications of the findings for astrobiology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its closest approach to Earth in March 2024.</li>
    <li>The comet has been found to carry a key molecule associated with life.</li>
    <li>Research is being conducted by scientists from NASA and ESA.</li>
    <li>The discovery could have implications for understanding life's origins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2019. Since then, it has been monitored as it travels through the solar system. Recent studies have confirmed the presence of a key molecule related to life.</p>
<p>The comet is currently on a trajectory that will bring it into close proximity to Earth in March 2024, prompting increased interest from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of this molecule could be a crucial piece in understanding how life might arise elsewhere in the universe,” said a lead researcher from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of comets have suggested they may have played a role in delivering organic compounds to Earth. This recent finding adds to the growing body of evidence that comets could be more than just icy bodies in space; they may be carriers of the essential ingredients for life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with plans for detailed observations and analysis to further explore the implications of the findings for astrobiology.</p>
