      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Avi Loeb Calls Out Experts Dismissing Exocomet’s Technological Origin Hypothesis Ahead Of Earth Flyby</h2>

<p>Professor Avi Loeb has criticized experts who dismiss the technological origin hypothesis of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in a blog post published ahead of the comet's flyby of Earth. 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and is the third interstellar visitor recorded, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>This debate is significant as it challenges the prevailing understanding of comets and the broader cosmic context. Loeb has documented at least 13 anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS and argues that the scientific community should be more open to exploring these phenomena rather than adhering strictly to traditional definitions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovered by: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors: 1I/Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>Number of anomalies identified by Loeb: 13</li>
    <li>Number of supporting papers published by Loeb: 11</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS. Since its discovery, its behavior has raised questions about its classification as a comet. Loeb has actively engaged with the scientific community to discuss his findings and hypotheses regarding the object.</p>
<p>In a recent blog post, Loeb expressed frustration at the reluctance of experts to consider alternative explanations for the anomalies observed in 3I/ATLAS, particularly the anti-tail phenomenon that contradicts standard comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Why are comet experts and NASA officials so reluctant in displaying curiosity about the anti-tail or other anomalies of 3I/ATLAS?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is no doubt that we can learn something new from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, irrespective of whether it is an icy rock or a spacecraft.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The only obstacle to learning is comet experts who display the arrogance of expertise.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS is part of a larger discussion in the scientific community about the classification and understanding of interstellar objects. Previous encounters with 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have sparked interest but also skepticism regarding their origins and characteristics.</p>
<p>Loeb's views contrast sharply with those of many in the astronomical community who prefer to adhere to established theories of comet behavior. His hypothesis presents a challenge to these conventions and encourages further investigation into unexplained phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, the scientific community will likely continue to monitor its behavior and characteristics. Ongoing discussions and research may lead to further analysis of the anomalies Loeb has identified, although no formal investigations or charges have been announced at this time.</p>
