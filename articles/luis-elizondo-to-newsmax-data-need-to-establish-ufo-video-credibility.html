      <h2>Luis Elizondo to Newsmax: Data Need to Establish UFO Video Credibility</h2>

<p>Former Pentagon official Luis Elizondo has stated that more data is necessary to validate the credibility of UFO videos, during an interview with Newsmax on September 13, 2025. Elizondo emphasized the need for additional metadata, including velocity, altitude, and trajectory, to clarify what is depicted in the footage.</p>

<p>This discussion follows a recent testimony from military whistleblowers who claimed to have witnessed UFOs. They accused the U.S. intelligence community of attempting to conceal these encounters. The significance of Elizondo's comments lies in the ongoing push for transparency regarding UFO sightings and the need for comprehensive investigations.</p>
