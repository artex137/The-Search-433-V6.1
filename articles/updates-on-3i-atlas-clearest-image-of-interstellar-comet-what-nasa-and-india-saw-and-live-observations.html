      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-25 09:35 UTC</p>

      <h2>Updates on 3I/ATLAS: Clearest image of interstellar comet, what NASA and India saw, and live observations</h2>

<p>NASA and astronomers from India have made significant observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in recent days. The comet has continued to attract attention as various scientists capture images and analyze its behaviour. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the observations.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it expands our understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics. NASA has released a series of images taken by its spacecraft, while Indian astronomers have also contributed findings. The public has shown a keen interest in the comet, which has sparked various theories and discussions among experts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nine spacecraft have observed the comet since its discovery.</li>
    <li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured a photo on October 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA held a live press conference on November 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Indian observations occurred from November 12 to 15, 2025, at Mount Abu.</li>
    <li>Canadian astrophotographer Paul Craggs captured images on November 22, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 670 million kilometres from the Sun during its discovery.</li>
    <li>It was moving at a speed of 61 km/sec when first observed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured an image of the comet on October 2, 2025, but its release was delayed due to a government shutdown. On November 19, NASA held a press conference to share the image and confirmed that the comet shows no signs of being technologically advanced. Between November 12 and 15, 2025, Indian astronomers from Mount Abu observed the comet, noting its behaviour was consistent with solar system comets. On November 22, Canadian astrophotographer Paul Craggs captured clear images of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate, stated, "We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures [technological traces of intelligent life] or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS are part of a broader interest in interstellar objects. The comet has been compared to typical solar system comets based on its behaviour. Some scientists, including Harvard's Avi Loeb, have speculated about its nature, but these claims have been met with skepticism from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations and studies of 3I/ATLAS are expected from various scientific communities. NASA and other organizations will continue to analyze the comet as new data becomes available, with further updates likely in the coming months.</p>
