      <h2>Obama says aliens are 'real.' Congress has heard about UFOs for years</h2>

<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama has stirred public interest by stating that aliens are "real" during a podcast interview with Brian Tyler Cohen on February 14, 2023. The comment has garnered significant media attention, prompting Obama to clarify his remarks the following day on social media, asserting that while the universe is vast, he has seen "no evidence" of extraterrestrial visitation during his presidency.</p>

<p>This discussion is relevant as Congress has held multiple hearings regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) in recent years. The ongoing exploration of UAP has raised questions about government transparency and the potential existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of podcast interview: February 14, 2023</li>
    <li>Obama's original comment: "They're real, but I haven't seen them."</li>
    <li>Clarification on Instagram: February 15, 2023</li>
    <li>Congress hearings on UFOs: Three since 2023</li>
    <li>Notable testimony date: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Witnesses included military veterans and journalists</li>
    <li>Video of UAP incident released during September hearing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2023, Obama participated in a podcast with Cohen, during which he answered a question about aliens in a lightning round format. His response, although brief, sparked widespread discussion.</p>

<p>The following day, Obama took to Instagram to clarify his comments, stating that while life may exist elsewhere in the universe, the likelihood of Earth having been visited by aliens is low.</p>

<p>Congress has convened hearings on UAP on three occasions since 2023, with the most recent testimony occurring on September 9, 2025, where witnesses discussed their experiences and alleged government concealment of information regarding UAP.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>
<p>- Barack Obama, February 15, 2023</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussions surrounding UAP have intensified since July 2023, when public testimony by witnesses reignited interest in the topic. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has been tasked with investigating UAP sightings, primarily reported by military personnel. However, the AARO has denied finding evidence of extraterrestrial origins for these phenomena.</p>

<p>In September 2023, NASA also released a report stating that it had found no evidence linking UAP to extraterrestrial life, though officials called for further investigation into the matter.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue its investigations into UAP, with advocates pushing for transparency from the federal government regarding findings and potential legislation aimed at ensuring the release of more information on the subject.</p>
