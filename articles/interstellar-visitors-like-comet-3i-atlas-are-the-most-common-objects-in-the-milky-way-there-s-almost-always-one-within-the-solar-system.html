      <h2>Interstellar visitors like comet 3I/ATLAS are the most common objects in the Milky Way: 'There's almost always one within the solar system'</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, is currently traversing the solar system, capturing the attention of astronomers and the public alike. This comet, which is not gravitationally bound to the sun, was discussed at the Europlanet Science Congress and Division for Planetary Sciences joint meeting held in Helsinki last week.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its representation of a larger category of celestial objects known as interstellar objects (ISOs). Chris Lintott, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Oxford, stated that these objects are among the most common in the galaxy. Astronomers anticipate that new telescopic capabilities will allow for the detection of many more ISOs in the near future.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently passing through the solar system.</li>
    <li>The Europlanet Science Congress and Division for Planetary Sciences meeting took place in Helsinki last week.</li>
    <li>Chris Lintott estimates there are approximately a hundred million trillion to a trillion trillion ISOs in the Milky Way.</li>
    <li>The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to detect between six and 51 ISOs over its 10-year duration.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may be around eight billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the Europlanet Science Congress and Division for Planetary Sciences meeting held in Helsinki last week, astronomers discussed the significance of 3I/ATLAS. Chris Lintott highlighted the frequency of interstellar visitors in the Milky Way galaxy and the challenges associated with detecting them.</p>
<p>Rosemary Dorsey from the University of Helsinki presented research on the LSST and its potential to identify numerous ISOs, further emphasizing the importance of 3I/ATLAS in current astronomical studies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These sorts of interstellar objects are the most common macroscopic objects in the galaxy,” said Chris Lintott.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These are our chance to get a sample-return mission from a distant planetary system,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects, 'Oumuamua and Borisov, had been confirmed. The increased detection capabilities from new telescopes are expected to change the current understanding of ISOs and their prevalence in the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS using ground-based telescopes and space observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble. Future surveys may yield new insights into the characteristics and origins of interstellar objects.</p>
