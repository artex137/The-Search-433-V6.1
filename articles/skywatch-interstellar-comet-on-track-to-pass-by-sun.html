      <h2>Skywatch: Interstellar comet on track to pass by sun</h2>

<p>Multiple Mauna Kea observatories have been monitoring the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. The comet, originating from outside the solar system, is scheduled to pass close to the sun in November 2025.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object from interstellar space to be observed. Authorities are preparing for the comet's close approach, which will limit ground-based studies. However, the comet will be visible again in December, allowing for further observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered by ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Only the third known interstellar object observed.</li>
    <li>Close approach to the sun scheduled for November 2025.</li>
    <li>Visible again in December 2025 for further studies.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar object, ‘Oumuamua, discovered in Hawaii.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed during the summer months by multiple observatories on Mauna Kea. The comet was first identified by the ATLAS survey telescope, highlighting its interstellar origin.</p>
<p>As it approaches the sun in November 2025, ground-based observatories will no longer be able to study it. However, it will become visible again in December 2025, enabling further investigations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a remarkable object, providing a unique opportunity to study interstellar material,” said a representative from the ‘Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaii.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the earlier identification of ‘Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object, which was also found in Hawaii. The study of such objects helps scientists understand the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the sun, astronomers will prepare for its December visibility to conduct further observations and studies of this unique comet.</p>
