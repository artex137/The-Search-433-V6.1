      <h2>Putin dubs 3I/ATLAS 'Russia's secret weapon' as planet braces for alien invasion</h2>

<p>Vladimir Putin has called the comet 3I/ATLAS a 'secret weapon' during an event on December 19, 2023, amid ongoing speculation about the existence of alien life. The Russian president made the comments in response to a reporter's question about the comet, which has drawn significant attention from scientists and the public alike.</p>

<p>This statement comes as the acting NASA administrator, Sean Duffy, has stated that the comet poses "no threat to life" and contains "no aliens." The remarks reflect a growing intrigue surrounding 3I/ATLAS, which has baffled experts due to its unusual characteristics. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet may be more than a natural phenomenon, raising questions about its nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of Putin's remarks: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Acting NASA administrator: Sean Duffy</li>
    <li>Key expert: Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb</li>
    <li>Loeb's claims: Comet contains nickel and iron atoms</li>
    <li>Loeb's recent conclusion: Likely natural but still mysterious</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, interest in the comet 3I/ATLAS has surged, with scientists closely monitoring its activity. On December 19, during a public event, Putin was questioned about the comet and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. He humorously referred to the comet as Russia's "secret weapon," prompting laughter from attendees.</p>

<p>Prior to Putin's comments, Sean Duffy of NASA had publicly dismissed the idea that the comet poses a threat or harbours alien life. Meanwhile, Avi Loeb has published theories suggesting that the comet exhibits properties inconsistent with typical comet behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“At this point, given all the data that we have, I would agree that it’s most likely natural, but there are still a lot of things we don’t understand about it.”</blockquote> 
<p>- Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has continued to intrigue scientists since its discovery. The comet has been the subject of various theories, with some experts suggesting it may contain elements that do not align with known cometary science. Loeb's speculation about the comet being an alien spacecraft has sparked debate within the scientific community.</p>

<p>Other public figures, like Uri Geller, have also weighed in, suggesting that the comet may be part of a larger extraterrestrial phenomenon, although these claims lack scientific backing.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the properties of 3I/ATLAS are expected as scientists continue to analyze its behaviour and composition. The scientific community remains divided on the comet's true nature, and ongoing research may shed light on its origins and implications.</p>
