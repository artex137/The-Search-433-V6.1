      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shock: Interstellar Comet Could Be 14 Billion Years Old, Pre-Date Our Sun</h2>

<p>A newly discovered interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has sparked debate among astronomers since its detection by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) station in Chile on July 1, 2025. The object is estimated to be between eight and 14 billion years old, suggesting it predates our solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the early universe and the formation of celestial bodies. Michele Bannister, an associate professor at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, is leading a team investigating the comet, which is considered a "calling card from the past." The comet's chemistry differs fundamentally from known solar system comets, indicating it may have originated from a region populated by the Milky Way's oldest stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS (officially C/2025 N1)</li>
  <li>First detected: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile</li>
  <li>Estimated age: 8 to 14 billion years</li>
  <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles</li>
  <li>Perihelion (closest point to the Sun): October 29, 2025</li>
  <li>Final planetary flyby of Jupiter expected: March 2026</li>
  <li>Comet speed: Approximately 58 km/s (129,000 mph)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS station in Chile first detected 3I/ATLAS. Shortly after, Michele Bannister's team began analyzing the comet's characteristics. By October 29, 2025, the comet reached its closest point to the Sun. It made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Observations are ongoing, with expectations for a final flyby of Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “The chemistry of 3I/ATLAS is distinctive relative to our solar system comets, which is one of the things that will tell us what its home environment was like,” said Michele Bannister.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “If 3I/ATLAS were a standard comet, this anti-tail should not contain streaming gas beyond a distance of 5,000 kilometres from the nucleus,” stated Avi Loeb, a professor at Harvard University, regarding the comet's unusual glow and path.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique properties and potential origins have raised questions about the formation of comets and planetary systems in the early universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As observations continue throughout January 2026, researchers will analyze data from the comet before it disappears back into interstellar space. The scientific community awaits further insights into whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural cosmic object or an artificial probe.</p>
