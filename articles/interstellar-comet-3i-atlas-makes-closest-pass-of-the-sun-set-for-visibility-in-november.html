      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS makes closest pass of the sun, set for visibility in November</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, has made its closest approach to the sun, coming within approximately 126 million miles (203 million kilometers) of the star. The comet is currently located behind the sun from the perspective of Earth-based telescopes. Astronomers expect sightings of the comet in the predawn sky starting November 11.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers as it provides a limited opportunity to observe 3I/ATLAS before it continues its journey out of the solar system. Darryl Seligman, an assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University, noted that the comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, coming within about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers). The European Space Agency has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: 126 million miles (203 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Expected visibility: November 11, 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023, at 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Age of the comet: Between 3 billion and 11 billion years</li>
    <li>Previous close pass by Mars: October 3, 2023, at 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023. It made a close pass by Mars on October 3, 2023, coming within 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) of the planet. The comet has since faded from visibility for ground-based observatories in October but remains under observation by various missions.</p>
<p>As it approaches the sun, the comet releases gas and dust, forming its tail. Observations have detected substances such as carbon dioxide and water ice being expelled from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "When it gets closest to the sun, you get the most holistic view of the nucleus possible," said Darryl Seligman, emphasizing the importance of understanding the volatiles that reveal the primordial materials from which the comet was formed.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object observed passing through our solar system. Unlike typical comets, which are often described as "dirty snowballs," 3I/ATLAS carries materials from its own unique star system. Its composition provides insights into the differences between interstellar and solar system comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After the anticipated visibility in November, astronomers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observations from missions such as ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, are planned, although data from these may not be available until February due to slow transmission rates.</p>
