      <h2>Comet or mystery? Debate as NASA unveils images of object 29 million kilometres away</h2>

<p>NASA has unveiled close-up images of Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object currently 29 million kilometres away, sparking debate among scientists about its true nature. The comet, discovered in July 2025, passed harmlessly by Mars last month and poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the solar system. NASA is conducting a comprehensive observation campaign to learn more about the comet, which may differ from typical solar system comets in its composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
  <li>The comet is currently about 307 million kilometres from Earth.</li>
  <li>It will make its closest approach to Earth at 269 million kilometres in mid-December 2025.</li>
  <li>NASA and the European Space Agency have been monitoring the comet with various spacecraft.</li>
  <li>NASA's observation campaign aims to gather data on the comet's composition and behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by a telescope in Chile. The comet made its closest approach to Mars in October 2025. NASA and the European Space Agency began close observations of the comet shortly after its discovery.</p>
<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA released images of the comet, prompting discussions among scientists regarding its classification. Observations from the Hubble telescope revealed unique characteristics of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “NASA has an opportunity to learn about the ways that 3I/ATLAS differs from our solar system's home-grown comets and give scientists a new window into how the compositions of other systems may differ from our own,” NASA stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for solar system bodies. “The evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It's a comet.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third object confirmed to have traveled from another star, following the discoveries of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of interstellar comets provides insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue its observation campaign of Comet 3I/ATLAS, with data expected to be analyzed and shared in February 2026. Scientists will further investigate the comet's characteristics and trajectory as it travels back into interstellar space.</p>
