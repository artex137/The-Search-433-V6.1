      <h2>New 3I Atlas Hubble Photos Show Interstellar Object Is A Comet - But Why Does It Pulsate Like A Heartbeat?</h2>

<p>Fresh images from the Hubble Space Telescope have confirmed that the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS is an active comet rich in volatile ices, according to data published by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). This object was first detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed visitor from beyond the Solar System. Scientists note that its structure and behavior closely resemble those of known comets, despite its origin outside the Sun's gravitational influence. Authorities from NASA and ESA continue to analyze the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First detected: July 2025</li>
    <li>Observatories involved: NASA, ESA, James Webb Space Telescope</li>
    <li>Key findings: Active comet with a distinct coma and jets</li>
    <li>Composition: Rich in carbon dioxide, with traces of water ice and carbon monoxide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii. Subsequent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have confirmed its active comet status, revealing a distinct coma and jets of gas and dust. Ground-based images have also shown multiple jets extending from the comet.</p>
<p>NASA and ESA have released findings indicating that the comet is shedding material due to solar radiation heating its surface, a hallmark of cometary activity. Ongoing spectral and photometric studies continue to provide insights into its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object is shedding material as solar radiation heats its surface, confirming it as an active comet,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Despite the speculation about a heartbeat-like rhythm, such jet behavior is common among comets,” emphasized an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its unusually high concentration of carbon dioxide, setting it apart from most Solar System comets studied to date. Previous interstellar objects have provided limited insights into the formation of small icy bodies in other star systems.</p>
<p>While the comet's heartbeat-like activity remains speculative, scientists agree that 3I/ATLAS is one of the most scientifically valuable interstellar objects observed, enhancing understanding of material formation beyond the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System. Ongoing observations will aim to clarify the characteristics of its jet activity and further investigate its composition.</p>
