      <h2>Top secret military firm confesses to sparking New Jersey drone hysteria that left America on edge</h2>

<p>A private firm contracted by the United States military has admitted responsibility for mysterious flying objects seen over New Jersey in November 2024. The sightings, which generated widespread concern about unidentified flying objects (UFOs), were revealed during a presentation at the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the incidents.</p>

<p>This admission is significant as it clarifies the source of the mass hysteria that gripped the state last year. Authorities, including the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, are now collaborating with state and local law enforcement to investigate the reported sightings and enhance detection methods.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: November 2024</li>
    <li>Location: New Jersey, particularly near Atlantic City</li>
    <li>Number of reported sightings: 964 (from November 19 to December 13, 2024)</li>
    <li>Agency involved: U.S. military contractor (name not disclosed)</li>
    <li>Official statements from: John Kirby, National Security spokesman</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2024, numerous reports of unidentified objects lighting up the night sky emerged, coinciding with viral social media footage capturing strange aerial phenomena. On August 2025, an employee from the contractor confirmed at a military summit that the firm had launched the objects as part of a testing exercise.</p>
<p>During the summit, the employee stated, "You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us," indicating that the objects were part of a private government contract. The contractor conducted a live demonstration of their aerial craft, which reportedly had an unconventional appearance and could easily disappear from sight.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>John Kirby, National Security spokesman:</strong> "We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat or have a foreign nexus."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Former CIA operations officer Laura Ballman:</strong> "Now in terms of who is behind this... this is actually a classified exercise to test either evasion technology or detection technology in urban areas."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The New Jersey sightings have sparked discussions about the implications of military testing in civilian airspace. Authorities have previously warned that drone sightings may indicate classified exercises. The incident has raised questions about transparency and the potential impact on public safety.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are ongoing. These agencies are working with local law enforcement to enhance detection capabilities and better understand the origins of the reported sightings. Further updates are expected as the investigations progress.</p>
