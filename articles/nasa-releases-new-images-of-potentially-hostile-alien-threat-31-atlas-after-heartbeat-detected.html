      <h2>NASA releases new images of 'potentially hostile alien threat' 3I/ATLAS after 'heartbeat' detected</h2>

<p>NASA has published new images of comet 3I/ATLAS after a 'heartbeat' was detected from the celestial body, which has puzzled scientists since its discovery. The comet, confirmed by NASA, exhibits unusual behaviors, including a lack of a tail for an extended period and erratic movement patterns. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as scientists attempt to understand the comet's behavior ahead of its planned close encounter with Earth on 19 December. The new images, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, show the comet approximately 178 million miles away from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in space, causing confusion among scientists.</li>
    <li>The comet is set for a close encounter with Earth on 19 December 2023.</li>
    <li>New images were taken by the Hubble Space Telescope on 30 November 2023.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency captured images from the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) orbiter on 2 November 2023.</li>
    <li>A Harvard astrophysicist claims the comet exhibits a pulsing behavior every 16.16 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed, generating intrigue due to its peculiar characteristics. On 2 November 2023, the European Space Agency captured images of the comet from the Juice orbiter, revealing a potential dual tail structure. On 30 November 2023, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope provided images of the comet as it approached the Sun.</p>
<p>Recently, scientists noted a 'heartbeat' pattern in the comet, leading to speculation about its nature, with some suggesting it may not be a traditional comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Not only do we clearly see the glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet known as its coma, but we also see a hint of two tails,” according to the European Space Agency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, stated the comet exhibits jets at intervals of 16.16 hours, suggesting it could be an alien craft.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr Matthew Genge, a micrometeorite and cosmic dust specialist at Imperial College London, remarked that periodic brightening of the comet is not particularly unusual and suggested the pulsing could be due to ice on its surface.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has raised interest in the scientific community due to its atypical behavior. Historically, comets are expected to display tails as they approach the Sun, yet 3I/ATLAS lacked this feature for a significant period. The recent discovery of a 'heartbeat' adds to the ongoing discussions about the nature of this celestial object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with further analyses expected to determine the causes of its unusual behaviors. The upcoming close encounter on 19 December will provide additional opportunities for observation and study.</p>
