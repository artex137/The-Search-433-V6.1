      <h2>Warning Issued Over Comet Hurtling Towards The Sun, Is It Alien Technology?</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS is currently on a trajectory toward its closest approach to the Sun, raising questions among astronomers about its origins and nature. The object, first discovered in July 2023, is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a United Nations-endorsed organization, has launched its first systematic monitoring campaign for an interstellar object due to the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities are working to better understand its trajectory and composition, as some scientists have suggested it could be a piece of alien technology rather than a natural comet. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently approaching the Sun.</li>
    <li>First discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Estimated size is comparable to Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Will pass at a distance of about 1.8 times the space between Earth and the Sun.</li>
    <li>IAWN has initiated the Comet Astrometry Campaign, running from late 2025 into early 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Since then, its peculiar characteristics have sparked debate among scientists regarding its composition and behavior. Notably, it emits nickel tetracarbonyl, a compound typically associated with industrial processes on Earth, and displays an unusual "anti-tail" of gas pointing toward the Sun. Dr. Abraham Loeb from Harvard University has suggested it could be artificial, proposing it may act as a "mothership" releasing mini-probes near the Sun's gravity well, set for October 29, 2023.</p>

<p>In response to these findings, the IAWN has implemented the Comet Astrometry Campaign to enhance global detection and monitoring techniques for such rare objects. This campaign will utilize global assets to refine understanding of the comet's trajectory and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While most of the scientific community maintains that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, its unique challenges have prompted an unprecedented response from planetary defense organizations,” said an IAWN spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“NASA officials have consistently reassured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth,” the agency stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system, following previous discoveries that have stimulated interest in the study of such celestial bodies. The scientific community continues to investigate the properties of these objects, particularly as they present unique challenges for astronomical observation and planetary defense.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN's Comet Astrometry Campaign will run from late 2025 into early 2026, focusing on improving detection and monitoring of interstellar objects. Further observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue as it approaches Earth in December 2023.</p>
