      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shock: Interstellar Object 'Bleeding Matter' In Way No Comet Should</h2>

<p>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting unusual behaviour as it travels through our solar system. This object, which reached perihelion on October 29 or 30, 2025, is shedding material in a manner that defies conventional cometary expectations, according to recent NASA observations.</p>

<p>The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS raises significant questions about current comet theories. Authorities are monitoring the object closely, as it is set to make a close approach to Jupiter in March 2026. Researchers are particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms behind its steady mass loss, which contrasts sharply with the chaotic behaviour typically observed in comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29 or 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Inbound Velocity:</strong> 44 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Sun at Perihelion:</strong> 130 million miles (210 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Close Approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 2026 at 0.357 AU (about 33 million miles or 53 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Mass Loss Rate:</strong> Approximately 10 million kilograms of dust released over one month</li>
    <li><strong>Gas Composition:</strong> Includes CO2 and H2O ice, with low levels of water gas</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. It reached perihelion on October 29 or 30, 2025, at approximately 130 million miles from the sun. Recent observations from NASA's Parker Solar Probe and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory have indicated ongoing activity from the object, which is now moving on a retrograde trajectory.</p>

<p>Further observations from Tenerife, Spain, have revealed that the object is losing mass in a controlled manner, with no signs of chaotic outbursts. The next significant event will be its close approach to Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The calm profile of mass loss from 3I/ATLAS is precisely what makes the data so unsettling for comet science,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist. “This behaviour hints at an underlying mechanism that current models simply do not describe.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/&#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike typical comets that exhibit explosive mass loss, 3I/ATLAS is shedding material in a steady and organized fashion, raising questions about the nature of its surface and internal structure.</p>

<p>This anomaly in behaviour suggests that the object may have originated in an environment different from that of ordinary comets, potentially hinting at a unique evolutionary history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026. Investigations will focus on understanding the mechanisms behind its unusual mass loss and the implications for comet science.</p>
