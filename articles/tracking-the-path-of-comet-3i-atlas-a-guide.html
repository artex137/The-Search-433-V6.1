      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is set to make a close approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, when it will be approximately 270 million kilometers away from the planet. This distance is nearly 700 times further than the average distance to the Moon. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's passage.</p>

<p>Astronomers are keen to study Comet 3I/Atlas as it travels through the solar system. Authorities, including NASA, are using powerful telescopes to observe the comet and gain insights into its composition. However, due to its significant distance, the comet will not be visible to the naked eye.</p>
