      <h2>NASA Faces Pressure from Avi Loeb to Release 3I/ATLAS Photos</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has publicly pressured NASA to release high-resolution images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, as discussions around his controversial theories regain prominence. Loeb claims that the object, which is currently travelling through our galaxy, could be an extraterrestrial craft rather than a natural comet.</p>

<p>This demand has prompted scrutiny of NASA's handling of the images captured on 2 October by the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Loeb argues that the data could provide crucial insights into 3I/ATLAS and its unusual characteristics, which he believes warrant further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of image capture:</strong> 2 October 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Agency involved:</strong> NASA</li>
    <li><strong>Location of images:</strong> Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
    <li><strong>Astrophysicist:</strong> Avi Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Upcoming trajectory:</strong> Pass by the Sun later in October 2023, and fly by Jupiter in early 2024</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the nature of 3I/ATLAS over the past few months, citing several unusual observations. He has questioned the object’s size, lack of a comet tail, and its chemical composition, which he suggests may include a synthetic nickel mixture. The images taken by NASA on 2 October are central to his claims.</p>
<p>Loeb has been vocal in demanding transparency from NASA, stating that the agency should share the data with scientists rather than wait on a press release. His theories have sparked debate within the scientific community regarding the potential implications of the object's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The politics of the day should not sabotage science. They have the data. They should share it with scientists. They can wait with any press release."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ross Coulthart, an investigative reporter for NewsNation, described Loeb's theory as "inflammatory" but acknowledged the need for more funding for this line of research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's theories have stirred discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial technology, with his observations challenging the prevailing scientific consensus on interstellar objects. Past incidents involving anomalous celestial phenomena have led to similar debates, but no conclusive evidence has emerged to support claims of artificial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community is expected to continue debating the implications of 3I/ATLAS and whether NASA will release the requested images. As the comet approaches the Sun and subsequently departs from our solar system, the window for gathering data may close, leaving unanswered questions about the object's true nature.</p>
