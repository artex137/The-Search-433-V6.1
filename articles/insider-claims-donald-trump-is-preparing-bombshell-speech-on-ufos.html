      <h2>Insider claims Donald Trump is preparing bombshell speech on UFOs</h2>

<p>Reports indicate that former President Donald Trump may be preparing a speech to reveal decades of purported UFO evidence. Mark Christopher Lee, a UK-based writer and self-proclaimed ufologist, claims he received information from an advisor to the Trump administration that Trump has been authorized by global leaders to make this announcement.</p>

<p>This potential speech is significant as it could represent the first official acknowledgment of extraterrestrial life by a world leader. Authorities have not disclosed specific details about the content or timing of the speech, but it is said to include evidence involving unexplained aerial phenomena and military eyewitness accounts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mark Christopher Lee reported the information from a Trump administration advisor.</li>
    <li>The speech is expected to address decades of UFO evidence.</li>
    <li>It may coincide with the 79th anniversary of the Roswell incident on July 8.</li>
    <li>Key incidents may include the USS Nimitz encounter from November 2004 and the USS Theodore Roosevelt encounters from 2015.</li>
    <li>Lee described the advisor as a successful business person involved in examining historical UFO records.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September, the speech was originally scheduled to be delivered at the United Nations General Assembly. However, it has now been rescheduled to align with the anniversary of the Roswell incident on July 8. Lee noted that new intelligence developments have made the announcement urgent.</p>

<p>Lee emphasized that Trump may act spontaneously and could choose to announce the information before July 8, amid concerns that other countries might disclose similar information first.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He will confirm that forensic analysis of recovered off-world vehicles and non-human biologics has established their extraterrestrial origin,” Lee stated. “He will emphasize that he is the first president to authorize full disclosure because the American people deserve transparency.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Recent years have seen increasing scrutiny of unidentified aerial phenomena by military and congressional investigations. Notable incidents include the USS Nimitz encounter, where ex-Navy pilot David Fravor reported observing an object resembling a "Tic Tac" during a training mission in 2004.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Pentagon has released footage of the GoFast and Gimbal incidents from 2015, further fueling public interest and speculation regarding UFOs and government transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the planned speech approaches, further developments in intelligence and public discourse on UFOs are anticipated. Investigations into historical records and military encounters may continue, shaping the context of any future disclosures.
