      <h2>NASA mobilizes planetary defense after interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS emits mysterious radio signals</h2>

<p>NASA has activated its planetary defense protocol following the detection of radio emissions from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025. The comet, identified by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), is the third known object to visit our solar system from interstellar space and is currently being closely monitored by global space agencies.</p>

<p>The activation of the planetary defense measures is significant as it aims to assess the comet’s characteristics and trajectory, which could provide insights into the formation of other stellar systems. The comet travels at approximately 100,000 kilometers per hour and exhibits dynamic behavior, releasing gas and dust. According to NASA’s Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária (PDCO), the volatile nature of 3I/ATLAS requires continuous monitoring to ensure no risk of collision exists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The comet was observed emitting radio signals on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Signals detected at a frequency of 1.6 GHz indicate the presence of hydroxyl molecules.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA conducted a simulation exercise in August 2025 using 3I/ATLAS as a hypothetical threat scenario.</li>
    <li>International collaboration involved the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) and the European Space Agency (ESA).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA’s ATLAS system detected the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. This event triggered an immediate mobilization of the planetary defense protocol to monitor its trajectory and emissions. On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa captured radio signals from the comet, confirming its active state. The closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, where it passed at a safe distance, providing a unique opportunity for scientific research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activation of PDCO reflects how seriously we take protecting the planet,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The confirmation of the comet’s emissions has provided unprecedented data for planetary science,” noted one of the astronomers involved in the observation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS has highlighted the importance of enhancing sky surveillance capabilities. Previous interstellar visitor 2I/Borisov behaved differently, which has provided unique insights into the diversity of small celestial bodies. The analysis of 3I/ATLAS contributes to understanding the dynamics of comet behavior and the implications for future planetary defense missions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze the data collected to refine models of comet behavior. This ongoing research is crucial for improving strategies for potential future threats from space.</p>
