      <h2>The Latest Breaking News on Comet 3I/ATLAS Blazes 7X Faster: Harvard Expert Suggests 'Hint of Design'</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has baffled scientists by brightening seven times faster than expected and turning blue, according to recent observations. A Harvard expert has suggested that its unusual trajectory may indicate a "possible hint of design." There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this celestial event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for the scientific community as it raises questions about the nature of the comet, which appears to be emitting light rather than merely reflecting it. Authorities, including astronomers and physicists, are currently analyzing the comet's characteristics to understand its origins and implications for our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has brightened 7 times faster than anticipated.</li>
  <li>The comet has turned blue, indicating it may emit light.</li>
  <li>Harvard experts are investigating its unusual path.</li>
  <li>No injuries or fatalities reported.</li>
  <li>Physicist Brian Cox has stated the comet is a natural object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent observations have indicated that Comet 3I/ATLAS is behaving differently than expected. The comet has become significantly brighter and has changed color. Experts have attributed these changes to its unique composition and trajectory.</p>

<p>On [exact date not disclosed], physicist Brian Cox confirmed that the comet is composed of ice, dust, and carbon dioxide, dismissing claims of it being of extraterrestrial origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Isn’t the truth wonderful enough?” asked TV astronomer Brian Cox in response to speculation about the comet's origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object, which has sparked interest due to its unusual properties and trajectory. Previous studies of comets have generally focused on their behavior as they approach the Sun, but 3I/ATLAS has defied typical patterns, raising questions about its formation and age.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations are planned to understand the comet's unusual characteristics. Scientists aim to gather more data to determine the implications of its behavior and composition for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
