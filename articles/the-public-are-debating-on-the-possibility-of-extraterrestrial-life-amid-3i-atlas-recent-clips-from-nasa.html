      <h2>The public are debating on the possibility of extraterrestrial life amid 3I/ATLAS recent clips from NASA</h2>

<p>Since its discovery on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked public interest and debate regarding the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Observatories worldwide, including space probes, are monitoring the comet's unusual behavior and composition as it approaches the Solar System.</p>

<p>This comet's visit has led to discussions among scientists and the public about its chemical composition and physical activity. NASA and other institutions have been analyzing data from Comet 3I/ATLAS, which has shown atypical emissions of gases associated with the building blocks of life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Studied by NASA astrochemist Martin Cordiner using the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA).</li>
    <li>Notable chemical emissions include methanol and hydrogen cyanide.</li>
    <li>Comet has developed distinct tails made of dust and charged gas.</li>
    <li>Rapid brightening noted as it approached perihelion in early November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025. Following its discovery, it has been under observation by various global observatories. In November 2025, NASA reported that the comet rapidly brightened as it neared perihelion, leading to further investigation into its outgassing activity.</p>

<p>Scientists have noted that 3I/ATLAS has developed tails made of small solid particles and charged gas, as observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and ESA's JUICE mission. This behavior has deviated from expectations for comets of comparable size.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Molecules like hydrogen cyanide and methanol are at trace abundances and not the dominant constituents of our own comets. Here we see that, actually, in this alien comet they're very abundant,” said NASA astrochemist Martin Cordiner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The anomalously large ratio of methanol to hydrogen-cyanide production by 3I/ATLAS suggests a friendly nature for this interstellar visitor,” stated Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets, like 3I/ATLAS, are expected to have chemical compositions that differ from those of comets formed in our Solar System. This comet's passage presents a significant opportunity for scientific study, as it provides insights into materials from a different star system.</p>

<p>Despite scientific clarifications that the data does not indicate alien activity, public speculation continues, driven by the unusual characteristics of the comet and the imagery released by NASA.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS and release new observations and data as they become available. This ongoing analysis aims to deepen understanding of interstellar objects and their implications for life beyond Earth.</p>
