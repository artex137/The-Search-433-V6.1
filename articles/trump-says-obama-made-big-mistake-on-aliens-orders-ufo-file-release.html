      <h2>Trump says Obama made ‘big mistake’ on aliens, orders UFO file release</h2>

<p>Former President Donald Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of disclosing classified information regarding aliens during a podcast interview. Trump made the remarks aboard Air Force One on Thursday, amid his directive to release government files related to unidentified aerial phenomena and extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This exchange highlights ongoing discussions about government transparency concerning UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Trump’s order to identify and release relevant files could potentially provide the public with access to previously restricted information, although no timeline for the release has been disclosed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump spoke aboard Air Force One on Thursday.</li>
    <li>Obama made his comments during Brian Tyler Cohen’s podcast.</li>
    <li>Trump directed his administration to identify and release files related to UFOs.</li>
    <li>No specific timeline for document release has been provided.</li>
    <li>Obama clarified his remarks on Instagram the day after the podcast.</li>
    <li>NASA estimates the odds of being alone in the universe are less than one in 10 billion trillion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Trump criticized Obama’s comments made the previous day on a podcast, stating that Obama “gave classified information.” Trump asserted that he had ordered the release of related government files on UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>The day after the podcast, Obama clarified his statements on Instagram, emphasizing that he saw no evidence of extraterrestrial contact during his presidency.</p>

<p>In past interviews, Obama has acknowledged the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena but has refrained from confirming any claims of extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He made a big mistake, he took it out of classified information,” Trump told reporters regarding Obama’s podcast remarks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Obama stated on Instagram.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident occurs against the backdrop of heightened scrutiny over classified documents recovered from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence after his term in office. These records included sensitive national security materials, although Trump has not linked Obama’s podcast comments to any specific classified documents or programs.</p>

<p>Previous presidents, including Bill Clinton, have also addressed claims related to Area 51, the military facility often associated with conspiracy theories about alien technology. Clinton stated that no unusual findings were reported after a review of claims tied to the facility.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Federal agencies have been directed to begin identifying and releasing documents related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life. However, the timeline for public access to this information remains unclear.</p>
