      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 K1 ATLAS, is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, flying by at a distance of 170 million miles. Discovered on July 1, 2025, this comet is the third recorded interstellar visitor to the solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Scientists and astronomers have expressed significant interest in 3I/ATLAS due to its unique characteristics, which some researchers, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, speculate could indicate it is an alien space probe. The comet has sparked curiosity among both professionals and amateur astronomers as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance during closest approach: 170 million miles (about 1.8 AU)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars on October 1, 2025, at 19 million miles</li>
    <li>Live stream event scheduled for November 19, 2025, at 4:15 UTC (10:30 am IST)</li>
    <li>Live stream organized by The Virtual Telescope Project 2.0</li>
    <li>Location of the robotic telescope: Meremma, Southern Tuscany</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has since drawn attention for its unusual features. In early October, the comet passed within 19 million miles of Mars, posing no threat to the planet. On November 18, 2025, a planned live stream event to observe the comet was postponed due to poor weather conditions. The event has been rescheduled for November 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has noted, "There are 12 anomalies in the interstellar interloper that warrant further investigation."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows two previous interstellar objects identified in the solar system, 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The increasing frequency of such discoveries has raised questions about the presence of interstellar materials and potential extraterrestrial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory out of the solar system, astronomers are expected to analyze data collected from its approach. The live stream on November 19 will provide an opportunity for the public to observe the comet and contribute to ongoing discussions about its characteristics.</p>
