      <h2>Exact date rare Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS will make closest flyby of Earth</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 AU. The comet, which is moving through our solar system at a speed of 60 kilometers per second, is currently not visible as it is obscured by the Sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever observed, and it provides a unique opportunity for scientists to study a comet that has been drifting through interstellar space for billions of years. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are preparing to use their telescopes to gather data on the comet's size, origins, and chemical makeup.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 1.8 AU (1 AU = 150 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Current speed: 210,000 km per hour (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li>Estimated width of the comet: up to 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): October 29, 2023, at 1.36 AU</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, astronomers detected a mysterious object entering the solar system. NASA later confirmed it as Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS, which is the fastest comet ever observed. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2023.</p>
<p>As it continues its journey, 3I/ATLAS will reappear in November 2025, when it will be observable through telescopes. It will then pass Earth at a safe distance before exiting the solar system forever.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is evidence that the comet has been drifting through interstellar space for billions of years and that it might be the oldest comet we’ve ever seen,” NASA stated regarding the significance of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever spotted, highlighting the rarity of such events. The previous two interstellar objects, 1I/2017 U1 and 2I/Borisov, were also studied by astronomers, but 3I/ATLAS offers a unique opportunity to learn more about the composition and history of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS to determine its size, origins, and chemical composition. Researchers aim to gather as much information as possible before the comet leaves the solar system permanently.</p>
