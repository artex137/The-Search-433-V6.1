      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: China releases image of 3I/ATLAS taken by Tianwen-1 Mars Orbiter</h2>

<p>China National Space Administration (CNSA) has released an image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, taken on October 3, 2023, by the Tianwen-1 Mars Orbiter. The comet was approximately 28.96 million kilometres from the orbiter at the time the photo was captured.</p>

<p>This development is significant as scientists continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited unusual changes in colour, brightness, and speed near the Sun. Observations suggest it has experienced non-gravitational acceleration, prompting further investigation into its nature. The comet is currently visible from Earth, with astronomers urging the public to observe it before it disappears.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Image captured by Tianwen-1 Mars Orbiter on October 3, 2023</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was 28.96 million kilometres from the orbiter</li>
    <li>NASA data indicates the comet accelerated to approximately 244,620 km/hr near the Sun</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, has noted the absence of a tail and cloud of gas around the comet</li>
    <li>Recent images from R. Naves Observatory and the Virtual Telescope Project confirm the lack of a cometary tail</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, CNSA released an image of 3I/ATLAS taken by the Tianwen-1 Mars Orbiter. The comet displayed significant changes in its properties as it approached the Sun. Following this, scientists noted its sudden acceleration and the unexpected absence of a tail, prompting further scrutiny.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS becomes clearer from Earth, experts are closely watching for any additional changes that may provide insights into its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The absence of a huge cloud of gas and dust around 3I/ATLAS will reveal the true nature of the object."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also mentioned, "Considering how much mass 3I/ATLAS should have lost near the Sun, there should be a 5 billion tons of cloud around it. But, till now, we are not seeing it."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the few interstellar comets observed to date. Its unusual characteristics have sparked interest among scientists, as they attempt to understand its origins and composition. The comet's behavior deviates from typical cometary patterns, particularly regarding its tail and surrounding material.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further observations may clarify its physical properties and help explain the anomalies noted during its journey near the Sun.
