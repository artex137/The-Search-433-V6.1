      <h2>Astronomers Notebook: A third interstellar interloper is passing by</h2>

<p>This summer, NASA confirmed the discovery of a mysterious object, designated 3I/ATLAS, racing through the solar system, making it the third known interstellar visitor. The announcement was made on July 1, based on data collected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) from observatories in Hawaii, Chile, and South Africa.</p>

<p>The significance of this discovery lies in its potential to provide insights into the origins of interstellar objects. NASA has noted that 3I/ATLAS is traveling at a speed of 152,000 miles per hour, which is approximately twice the speed at which Earth orbits the sun. Authorities are closely monitoring its trajectory as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the sun at closest approach: 1.4 astronomical units (about 209 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Nearest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles (about 274 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of nucleus: between 0.2 and 3.5 miles (0.32 to 5.63 kilometers)</li>
    <li>Origin direction: from the constellation Sagittarius</li>
    <li>Estimated age: at least 7 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA announced the discovery of 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025. The object was observed to be 4.5 astronomical units from the sun at the time. Following its closest approach to the sun on October 30, it became difficult to observe due to solar glare. Observations resumed in early November as it reappeared in the morning sky.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to make its nearest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is a remarkable interstellar comet that provides a unique opportunity to study material from outside our solar system,” said H.S. Augensen, director of the Widener University Observatory.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 1I/2017 U1, known as Oumuamua, discovered in October 2017, and 2I/Borisov, discovered in August 2019. Oumuamua sparked significant interest due to its unusual shape and trajectory, while Borisov resembled typical comets found in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, astronomers will continue observations to gather data on its composition and trajectory. Future studies may shed light on the origins of this interstellar object and its interactions with other celestial bodies.</p>
