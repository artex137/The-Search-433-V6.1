      <h2>Discovery of water in 3I/ATLAS reveals chemistry shared across the galaxy</h2>

<p>A team of Auburn University physicists has detected water’s ultraviolet fingerprint in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The discovery, made public on September 30, 2025, marks the first confirmed ultraviolet detection of water from a comet originating beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it provides evidence that water may be common throughout the galaxy. Researchers aim to understand the mechanisms behind the comet's release of water vapor, which occurred at a remarkable rate, and how this relates to the chemistry of other planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery made on September 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was 2.9 astronomical units from the Sun, approximately 434 million km (270 million miles).</li>
    <li>Water vapor released at a rate of around 40 kg per second (88 pounds per second).</li>
    <li>Observations conducted using NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</li>
    <li>First confirmed detection of water from an interstellar comet using space-based observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 31 and August 1, 2025, researchers conducted the first observing session with the Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope, yielding only a marginal detection of hydroxyl emissions.</p>

<p>A follow-up campaign on August 18 to 20 confirmed the emission with high statistical confidence. The team employed a stacking technique to produce clear images of the comet’s ultraviolet profile.</p>

<p>The final dataset included approximately 42 minutes of visible light and 2.3 hours of ultraviolet observations, confirming that the ultraviolet signal originated from gas emissions rather than reflected sunlight.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For decades, scientists have wondered whether water is common throughout the galaxy. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS finally offers a chance to test that idea,” said the lead researcher from Auburn University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The detection implies that 3I/ATLAS’s nucleus may be porous or layered, allowing internal pockets of ice to vent through fractures,” the researcher added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The story of interstellar comets began with 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017, which appeared dry and rocky. The second interstellar comet, 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019, was rich in carbon monoxide. Each object has provided insights into planetary system formation and evolution.</p>

<p>The detection of water in 3I/ATLAS suggests that comets from other star systems can preserve the same ices that shape our solar system’s comets, revealing a shared chemical heritage across the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers plan to continue studying 3I/ATLAS with instruments such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope when it becomes observable again after mid-November 2025.</p>
