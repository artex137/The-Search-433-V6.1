      <h2>'Nearly interstellar comet' draws comparisons to 3I/ATLAS. It's about to fly past Earth</h2>

<p>A newly discovered comet, designated C/2025 V1 (Borisov), is set to make its closest approach to Earth on Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2025, at a distance of approximately 64 million miles. The comet is too faint to be seen without a powerful telescope, according to the Minor Planet Center.</p>

<p>This discovery has sparked interest due to C/2025 V1's similarities to the infamous interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which will approach Earth on Dec. 19, 2025. Authorities and astronomers are monitoring both comets closely, as comparisons have prompted speculation about their origins and nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet C/2025 V1 (Borisov) will pass closest to Earth on Nov. 11, 2025.</li>
  <li>The object is located in the constellation Virgo.</li>
  <li>It will come within about 64 million miles of Earth, roughly 270 times the distance to the moon.</li>
  <li>Perihelion, or closest approach to the sun, will occur on Nov. 16, 2025.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on Dec. 19, 2025, at approximately 170 million miles away.</li>
  <li>First observations of C/2025 V1 were reported between Nov. 2 and Nov. 5, 2025.</li>
  <li>The comet is catalogued by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between Nov. 2 and Nov. 5, 2025, several observations of C/2025 V1 were reported to the Minor Planet Center. Amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov first spotted the comet, leading to its designation. The object has since been recognized for its unusual orbit and similarities to 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS was identified as the third interstellar object to enter the solar system, believed to have originated from outside it. Its closest approach to the sun has already occurred, and it is now moving towards its own closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite some similarities and speculation, the new comet likely originated from our solar system's Oort Cloud and is not directly connected to 3I/ATLAS,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of C/2025 V1 has drawn comparisons to prior interstellar comets, including Comet Oumuamua, detected in 2017, and Comet Borisov, identified in 2019. Both comets have also sparked speculation regarding their origins and potential extraterrestrial connections.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS has been linked to conspiracy theories suggesting it could be alien technology, a notion Loeb has publicly commented on, although he has indicated that it is most likely a natural comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As C/2025 V1 approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and visibility. Stargazers may attempt to observe it using powerful telescopes or binoculars, especially before sunrise.</p>
