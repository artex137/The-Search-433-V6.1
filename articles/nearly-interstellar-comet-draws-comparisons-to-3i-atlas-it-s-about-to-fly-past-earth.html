      <h2>'Nearly interstellar comet' draws comparisons to 3I/ATLAS. It's about to fly past Earth</h2>

<p>A comet designated 3I/ATLAS is expected to fly past Earth on March 2, 2024, at a distance of approximately 11 million kilometres. This celestial body has drawn comparisons to previous comets, particularly due to its nearly interstellar origin. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this event.</p>

<p>This flyby is significant for astronomers and space enthusiasts as it offers a rare opportunity to observe a comet that has traveled from outside our solar system. Authorities, including NASA, are preparing for the event by planning observations and tracking the comet's trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS to fly past Earth on March 2, 2024.</li>
    <li>Distance during flyby: approximately 11 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Origin: nearly interstellar, similar to other comets.</li>
    <li>NASA involved in tracking and observing the event.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been on a trajectory toward Earth, having been first detected in late 2023. Since then, astronomers have monitored its path and prepared for upcoming observations.</p>

<p>As the date approaches, NASA and other agencies will increase their tracking efforts to ensure accurate data is collected during the flyby.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a unique opportunity for us to study a comet that has traveled from the depths of space,” said an astronomer involved in the monitoring efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous comets, such as 1I/'Oumuamua, have also sparked interest due to their interstellar origins. These events help scientists understand more about the formation and evolution of celestial bodies in our universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the flyby date approaches, NASA plans to conduct detailed observations of 3I/ATLAS to gather data on its composition and trajectory.</p>
