      <h2>3I/ATLAS could have transmitted message to Earth in alien language: Scientist</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has suggested that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may be linked to the famous 1977 “WOW! signal,” a 72-second radio burst detected in Ohio. Loeb's analysis indicates that 3I/ATLAS was located in nearly the same part of the sky just days before the signal was recorded. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this analysis.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential implications for humanity. While NASA has classified the object as a comet, Loeb argues that its unusual path and resilience suggest it may have an artificial origin. He warns that if 3I/ATLAS has the capability to transmit signals, it could have "devastating consequences" for humanity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first observed earlier in the summer of 2023.</li>
    <li>The object will make a close pass by Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>Loeb claims the chance of two random sky directions aligning as they did is about 0.6 percent.</li>
    <li>Loeb has not disclosed any specific plans for scanning 3I/ATLAS for radio signals.</li>
    <li>NASA's lead scientist for small bodies is Tom Statler.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in the summer of 2023. Days before the “WOW! signal” was recorded in 1977, the object was in nearly the same part of the sky. In September 2023, 3I/ATLAS survived an energy blast from the Sun.</p>

<p>Loeb's analysis has prompted discussions among scientists regarding the potential for 3I/ATLAS to communicate with Earth. NASA maintains that 3I/ATLAS is simply a comet and not an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The chance of two random directions in the sky being aligned to that level is about 0.6 percent,” Loeb explained.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for small bodies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We must consider the possibility of a black swan event from interstellar objects resembling a comet at large distances, but potentially carrying devastating consequences to our future like a Trojan Horse,” Loeb warned.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The “WOW! signal” has puzzled scientists since its detection over four decades ago. While NASA has announced possible evidence of ancient alien life on Mars, it continues to assert that 3I/ATLAS is a comet. The ongoing debate around the nature of 3I/ATLAS reflects a larger context of increasing speculation about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb hopes that the coincidence with the WOW! signal will encourage scientists to investigate 3I/ATLAS for potential radio signals. No specific scanning plans have been announced as of now.</p>
