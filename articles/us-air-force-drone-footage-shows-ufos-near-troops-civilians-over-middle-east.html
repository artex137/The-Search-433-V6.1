      <h2>US Air Force Drone Footage Shows UFOs Near Troops, Civilians Over Middle East</h2>

<p>A series of leaked US Air Force drone videos appears to show unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in airspace used by both military personnel and civilian aircraft in the Middle East. The footage has raised concerns about aviation safety in the region. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the sightings.</p>

<p>The significance of the footage lies in its implications for airspace safety, particularly in areas where American and allied forces operate. Investigative journalists and UAP transparency advocates have circulated the clips, which reportedly show orb-like objects performing unusual maneuvers. Lawmakers and experts have called for increased transparency and safety protocols to address these incidents.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Footage captured by MQ-9 Reaper drones over the past decade.</li>
    <li>One clip from 23 August 2012 shows three orb-like lights in a triangular formation over the Persian Gulf.</li>
    <li>A 2021 sequence from the Syria-Jordan border shows an object evading radar lock.</li>
    <li>One segment appears to show an orb enduring a direct hit from a 100-pound Hellfire missile.</li>
    <li>Congressional hearing referenced some of the footage.</li>
    <li>Calls for transparency from Representative Eric Burlison and aviation safety analysts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Over the past decade, various clips have been captured by MQ-9 Reaper drones in the Middle East, documenting unidentified aerial phenomena. Notably, a clip from 23 August 2012 shows three lights in formation over the Persian Gulf. In 2021, another clip captures an object on the Syria-Jordan border evading a radar lock. During a recent congressional hearing, lawmakers discussed the implications of these sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Understanding unidentified aerial activity is not merely a matter of curiosity but of safety and operational integrity,” said Representative Eric Burlison during the congressional hearing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent leaks highlight ongoing concerns about unidentified aerial phenomena in military and civilian airspace. Experts warn that such objects could pose hazards to pilots and disrupt operations. Previous discussions from the Department of Defence have acknowledged the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena but have not provided formal explanations for the specific incidents captured in the leaked footage.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As pressure mounts for clearer communication from military authorities, investigations into the leaked footage may lead to further analysis and potential safety protocols. The military has not yet released any official statements addressing these incidents, leaving observers to interpret the implications of the footage.</p>
