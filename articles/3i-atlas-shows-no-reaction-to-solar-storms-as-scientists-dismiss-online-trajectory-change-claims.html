      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shows No Reaction to Solar Storms as Scientists Dismiss Online Trajectory Change Claims</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has shown no visible reaction to recent solar storms, according to astronomers and reports from The Economic Times. The object, discovered on July 1, 2025, has not displayed any signs of comet activity, such as a tail or gas emissions, despite its close approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>This information is significant as it addresses concerns raised by unverified claims circulating on social media regarding a possible change in the object's trajectory. Scientists are analyzing ongoing monitoring data, but no confirmed changes have been observed. NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) continues to track 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The object passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>At its closest point to Earth, 3I/ATLAS was about 270 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>It passed within 29 million kilometers of Mars on October 2–3, 2025.</li>
    <li>No confirmed changes in trajectory have been reported.</li>
    <li>ESA’s JUICE mission will track the object until November 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Eyes on the Solar System tool provides real-time updates on its movement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The object approached the Sun and reached its closest point on October 30, 2025. During this period, it was observed to remain inactive despite intense solar radiation.</p>
<p>Between October 1 and 4, 2025, China's Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS, which were confirmed by the China National Space Administration (CNSA). The object came closest to Mars on October 2–3, 2025, allowing for precise tracking data to be recorded.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS remains stable, and there is no evidence of trajectory alteration following its exposure to solar storms,” said a spokesperson from NASA’s CNEOS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor to the solar system, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The object is classified as moving along a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it will not return after leaving the solar system. Astronomers believe 3I/ATLAS may contain metal-rich or carbon-based compounds, with very few volatile materials that typically create a comet’s tail.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Data collected after the perihelion is under review to check for any subtle changes in 3I/ATLAS's composition or movement. Observations by NASA and the European Space Agency will continue, with further results expected in early 2026.</p>
