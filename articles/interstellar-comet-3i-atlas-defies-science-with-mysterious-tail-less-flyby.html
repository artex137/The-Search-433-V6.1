      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Defies Science with Mysterious Tail-Less Flyby</h2>

<p>A mysterious object from deep space, known as 3I/ATLAS, has baffled scientists after it recently swung past the Sun without developing a visible tail. The event occurred on November 5, 2023, and has sparked debates about the true nature of the object, which is now heading toward Jupiter.</p>

<p>This peculiar behavior challenges existing knowledge about comets. According to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, the absence of a tail suggests that 3I/ATLAS may not be a natural object. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) plan to closely observe its upcoming flyby near Jupiter on March 16, 2026, hoping to uncover more about its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object that entered the solar system in June 2025.</li>
    <li>It flew past the Sun on November 5, 2023, without a visible tail.</li>
    <li>New images from the R. Naves Observatory in Spain show this unusual characteristic.</li>
    <li>The object brightened dramatically and turned an unusual green color after its closest approach.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS displayed a brief “anti-tail” pointing toward the Sun, contrary to typical comet behavior.</li>
    <li>It is set to make a close pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA spacecraft will observe this flyby closely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in June 2025 as it entered the solar system. It made its closest approach to the Sun on November 5, 2023, during which it exhibited the unusual phenomenon of not forming a tail. Following this event, it brightened and changed color, leading scientists to further investigate its properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, stated, "If no tail appears, the object is likely not natural." </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is reminiscent of the interstellar object ‘Oumuamua, which also prompted discussions about its origins and composition. However, the lack of a tail and the presence of an anti-tail make 3I/ATLAS a uniquely strange case, raising questions about our current understanding of comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA spacecraft will monitor 3I/ATLAS closely during its flyby near Jupiter in March 2026. These observations are expected to provide valuable insights into the object's true nature and composition.</p>
