      <h2>NASA Livestream Abruptly Ends When 'UFO' Seen Doing a Flyby</h2>

<p>NASA has become the focus of speculation after viewers observed bright lights moving across an International Space Station (ISS) livestream at approximately 11:04 a.m. US Central Time. The footage cut out shortly after the lights appeared, prompting debates about the nature of the objects seen.</p>

<p>This incident has sparked discussions about the reliability of space imagery and the potential for misinterpretation. Authorities, including NASA, have not issued a formal statement regarding this specific incident. However, they have previously explained that short transmission dropouts are common during ISS operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred at approximately 11:04 a.m. US Central Time.</li>
    <li>Footage was taken from NASA's Earth-facing livestream.</li>
    <li>The video showed bright lights moving beneath the ISS.</li>
    <li>The original poster of the video claimed NASA cut to a signal-loss screen immediately after.</li>
    <li>Many viewers suggested the lights were likely reflections or city lights in Australia.</li>
    <li>NASA has not provided a formal statement on the incident.</li>
    <li>Routine signal interruptions during ISS operations are common.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The event began when the account UFO mania posted a one-minute video showing bright lights beneath the ISS. Viewers interpreted this as a potential UFO sighting. Shortly after the lights appeared, the livestream switched to a signal-loss screen, while audio from the ISS continued. The video quickly circulated on social media platforms, prompting a mix of interpretations.</p>

<p>As the clip gained traction on Reddit, many users began offering alternative explanations. Observers noted that the ISS was above Australia at night, suggesting the lights could be city illumination or bushfires. Some pointed out that the lights moved in sync with illuminated areas visible in the frame.</p>

<p>Additional comments highlighted that the brief interruption in the livestream coincided with routine communication handovers, which are standard during ISS operations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nobody from NASA has issued a formal statement about the broadcast, but the agency has explained in the past that transmission dropouts occur when the ISS switches between communication satellites.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident reflects a broader trend in which routine space imagery attracts extraordinary interpretations, especially when shared out of context. Previous occurrences of similar debates have often revolved around misidentified objects or phenomena observed in space footage.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to continue its routine operations and livestreams from the ISS. No investigations or formal inquiries into this specific incident have been announced.</p>
