      <h2>Astronomers detect a pulsing sunward jet from interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has reported new findings regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, based on observations conducted between July and September 2025 using the Two-meter Twin Telescope in Tenerife, Spain. The study identifies a periodic change in the direction of a narrow jet, known as an anti-tail, which is directed toward the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery holds significance as it enhances the understanding of interstellar objects that pass through the solar system. The ongoing study of these objects can provide insights into physical processes occurring beyond the Sun's gravitational influence. Researchers aim to use the data collected to describe the rotation and activity of 3I/ATLAS, contributing to the broader field of astrophysics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observations were conducted from July 2 to September 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>The data was collected using the Two-meter Twin Telescope in Tenerife, Spain.</li>
    <li>The anti-tail jet shows a periodic modulation with a period of 7.74 ± 0.35 hours.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, at approximately 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The findings represent the first periodic jet-angle modulation detected in an interstellar object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the observational period from July to September 2025, astronomers collected images over 37 nights, employing sidereal tracking and stacked exposures to monitor the anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS. The team measured the jet’s position angle at a fixed distance from the object’s brightness peak.</p>

<p>The study found that the jet direction follows a regular pattern, described as a wobble, as the object rotates. The derived rotation period of 15.5 hours is closely aligned with an earlier reported brightness variation period of 16.16 hours, supporting the interpretation that the jet's motion is linked to the object’s rotation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The data collected around that time by multiple telescopes on Earth and in space will educate us about the qualities of our latest interstellar visitor,” the authors stated regarding the upcoming observational opportunity in December.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    One reader commented, “Thank you for reminding the world that science should be an adventure into the unknown,” reflecting public interest in the ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS is essential for understanding the dynamics of celestial bodies that originate outside the solar system. Previous observations have highlighted the unique characteristics of these objects, contributing to the growing interest in interstellar research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth in December 2025, astronomers plan to conduct further observations to gather additional data on the object’s properties and behavior.</p>
