      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, now within 300 million km</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has passed within 300 million kilometers of Earth on the morning of November 23, according to the Laboratory of Solar Astronomy of the IKI RAS and the ISZF SB RAS. The object is currently moving closer to the planet at a rate of approximately two million kilometers each day.</p>

<p>This approach is significant for astronomers and space enthusiasts as it marks the third interstellar celestial body discovered in history. Scientists are monitoring the comet's trajectory as it continues to draw nearer, with no threat posed to Earth, according to officials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: November 23, 2023</li>
    <li>Current distance from Earth: 300 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Rate of approach: Approximately 2 million kilometers per day</li>
    <li>Projected closest approach date: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Projected distance at closest approach: 269 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Number of interstellar bodies discovered: 3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 23, 2023, at approximately 7:30 a.m. Moscow Time (4:30 a.m. GMT), 3I/ATLAS crossed the 300 million-kilometer threshold from Earth. The comet has been steadily approaching the planet, influenced primarily by Earth's orbital motion.</p>
<p>Scientists have noted that while 3I/ATLAS is nearing Earth, it is simultaneously on a trajectory out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Last Sunday, at around 7:30 a.m. Moscow Time, the interstellar ‘comet-ship’ crossed the psychologically significant boundary of 300 million kilometers from Earth and is currently continuing to reduce its distance to the planet by approximately two million km every day,” the statement from scientists said.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar body identified by astronomers, following the discovery of the asteroid Oumuamua in 2017 and the comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. These discoveries have provided valuable insights into celestial objects originating from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth. The comet is expected to reach its nearest distance on December 19, 2025, after which both celestial bodies will begin to move apart in space.</p>
