      <h2>An interstellar object is passing through our solar system. This UC program says to stay calm and carry on</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, is approaching the sun and is expected to reach its closest point by late October. The comet, discovered by NASA in July, is only the third known object from outside our solar system to pass through. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity for scientists to study an object from outside the solar system. According to Jameeka Marshall, a researcher at UC Santa Cruz, the comet has generated significant public interest and speculation. Marshall runs a program called Shadow the Scientists, which allows the public to observe scientists in real-time as they study the comet. She emphasized the importance of promoting scientific understanding amidst sensational claims about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to the sun in late October.</li>
    <li>First discovered by NASA in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Only the third known interstellar object passing through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Upcoming public sessions about the comet will occur on September 25 and in late November.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA discovered comet 3I/ATLAS in July 2023. As it approaches the sun, scientists anticipate that its material will turn into gas, allowing for further study of its composition.</p>

<p>On September 25, the Shadow the Scientists program will host a session focused on 3I/ATLAS, followed by another session in late November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This kind of sensationalism ends up ultimately... causing people to lose faith in more serious, evidence-based research and science.”</blockquote>
<p>— Raja GuhaThakurta, faculty director at UC Santa Cruz's department of Creating Equity in STEAM</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects is rare and provides valuable insights into the chemical composition of materials beyond our solar system. Previous objects, such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, have similarly sparked public interest and scientific inquiry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches the sun, scientists will continue to study its composition. The upcoming sessions in the Shadow the Scientists program will provide further information and engagement opportunities for the public.</p>
