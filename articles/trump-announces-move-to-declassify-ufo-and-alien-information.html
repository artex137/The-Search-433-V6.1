      <h2>Trump announces move to declassify UFO and alien information</h2>

<p>US President Donald Trump has announced he will order the release of government files on aliens and UFOs, citing public interest in the subject. Trump made the declaration via a post on Truth Social, following remarks from former President Barack Obama that have sparked widespread debate.</p>

<p>This announcement is significant as it reflects growing public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, will begin identifying and releasing relevant documents, according to Trump.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Who:</strong> US President Donald Trump</li>
    <li><strong>What:</strong> Announcement to declassify documents on UFOs and extraterrestrial life</li>
    <li><strong>Where:</strong> Truth Social platform</li>
    <li><strong>When:</strong> Announcement made Thursday</li>
    <li><strong>Related comments:</strong> Former President Barack Obama on UFOs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Saturday, former President Barack Obama stated in a podcast that he believes aliens are real, but he has not seen them and dismissed theories of underground facilities. Following this, Trump accused Obama of revealing classified information.</p>
<p>Trump's announcement on Truth Social came shortly after Obama's remarks, highlighting the ongoing public interest in the subject of UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “He made a big mistake,” Trump said, referring to Obama’s comments about aliens. “He’s not supposed to be doing that.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I don’t know if they’re real or not,” Trump said when asked about his personal beliefs regarding extraterrestrial life. “Many people believe in their existence, but I don’t have an opinion on it.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Public interest in UFOs has surged over recent years. In 2017, reports emerged about a secret Pentagon program investigating military pilots' testimonies regarding strange aerial phenomena. In 2022, Congress held its first hearings on UFOs in 50 years, which led to the establishment of a dedicated Pentagon office for collecting military reports.</p>
<p>Despite these developments, a US House of Representatives panel in 2023 produced no major revelations, and a Pentagon report in 2024 concluded there was “no evidence” of encounters with alien life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Federal agencies are expected to begin the process of identifying and releasing documents related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life as part of Trump's directive. Further developments regarding public access to this information will follow.</p>
