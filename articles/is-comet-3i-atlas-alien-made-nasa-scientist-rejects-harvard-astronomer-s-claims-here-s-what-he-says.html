      <h2>Is Comet 3I/Atlas alien-made? NASA scientist rejects Harvard astronomer’s claims - here’s what he says</h2>

<p>NASA scientists have responded to claims made by a Harvard astronomer regarding the nature of Comet 3I/Atlas. The discussion gained traction after the comet was observed in the solar system, with some suggesting it may be of alien origin. The debate has unfolded in recent weeks, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it touches on the ongoing exploration of extraterrestrial life and the scientific community's response to unusual astronomical findings. NASA scientists are actively analyzing the comet and its characteristics to provide clarity on its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas has been observed in the solar system.</li>
    <li>Claims of alien origin were made by a Harvard astronomer.</li>
    <li>NASA scientists have publicly rejected these claims.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the past weeks, Comet 3I/Atlas has been tracked as it enters the solar system. Following its discovery, a Harvard astronomer suggested that its characteristics might indicate an artificial origin. NASA scientists have since addressed these claims, emphasizing the importance of scientific evidence in such discussions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We rely on observable data to make conclusions about celestial objects, and we have not found evidence to support the idea that Comet 3I/Atlas is anything but a natural formation,” a NASA scientist stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The conversation around Comet 3I/Atlas is not the first instance of speculation regarding extraterrestrial life. Previous incidents have involved various astronomical phenomena being misinterpreted or sensationalized. The scientific community continues to advocate for rigorous analysis and evidence-based conclusions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to study Comet 3I/Atlas and share findings with the public and scientific community. Ongoing observations will aim to clarify the comet's properties and origins.</p>
