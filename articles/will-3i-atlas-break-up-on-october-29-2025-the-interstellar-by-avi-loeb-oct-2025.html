      <h2>Will 3I/ATLAS Break Up?</h2>

<p>On October 29, 2025, the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> will reach perihelion at a distance of <strong>203 million kilometers</strong> from the Sun. So far, no small objects have been clearly associated with 3I/ATLAS in astronomical data sets, according to the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

<p>This event is significant as it may provide insights into the nature of 3I/ATLAS and the processes affecting comets as they approach the Sun. Authorities, including the Galileo Project observatories, are monitoring for any new activity or debris related to 3I/ATLAS that could enhance our understanding of this object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of perihelion: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: 203 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Agency involved: European Space Agency (ESA)</li>
    <li>Monitoring project: Galileo Project</li>
    <li>Current status of associated objects: None verified</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed by various astronomical instruments leading up to its perihelion in late October 2025. The latest images from ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter show faint features around 3I/ATLAS, but these are likely noise artifacts rather than related objects.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches the Sun, scientists are particularly interested in any changes or new fragments that may emerge, as comets often disintegrate due to solar heating and gravitational forces.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS is a comet of natural origin, it could disintegrate into fragments as it comes closer to the Sun,” said astronomers involved in monitoring the object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets like 3I/ATLAS can break apart due to several factors, including solar radiation heating their icy nucleus and causing volatile ices to sublimate. Previous studies, such as those involving comet <strong>67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</strong>, indicate that such objects may have formed from smaller pieces, making them susceptible to breaking up when under stress.</p>
<p>The catastrophic breakup of comets has been observed before, notably with comet <strong>Shoemaker-Levy 9</strong>, which fragmented due to Jupiter's gravitational pull before impacting the planet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, scientists will continue to observe the comet for any signs of fragmentation or new activity. The results of these observations may influence future studies and our understanding of comet behavior in the solar system.</p>
