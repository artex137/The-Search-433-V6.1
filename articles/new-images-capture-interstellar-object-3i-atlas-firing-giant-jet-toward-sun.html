      <h2>New Images Capture Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Firing Giant Jet Toward Sun</h2>

<p>Recently captured images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS show it ejecting a massive jet of gas and dust toward the sun. The comet, discovered in late June and confirmed by NASA in early July, is believed to originate from a distant star system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected to date. Scientists are closely monitoring its behavior as it approaches the sun, which may yield insights into its composition and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Between 3 and 7 miles (5 to 11 kilometers) wide, making it the largest interstellar object encountered.</li>
    <li><strong>Origins:</strong> Potentially billions of years old, predating the sun.</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> Confirmed by NASA in July 2023.</li>
    <li><strong>Recent Observations:</strong> Images taken on August 2, 2023, at the Teide Observatory in the Canary Islands.</li>
    <li><strong>Next Key Date:</strong> Closest approach to the sun (perihelion) on October 29, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in late June 2023. NASA confirmed its status as an interstellar object in early July. New images were captured on August 2, 2023, revealing a fan-shaped jet of material extending toward the sun. The comet flew past Mars on October 3, 2023, and is on track for its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “As comets approach the sun, they heat unevenly, leading certain areas to release jets of gases and dust,” said astrophysicist Miquel Serra-Ricart.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its size but also for its age, possibly predating the formation of the sun. The observations of its activity support the understanding of it as a natural comet, countering theories that it may be an alien spacecraft, which have been suggested by a minority of researchers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers plan to observe 3I/ATLAS after its perihelion on October 29, 2023, to assess changes in the comet and its jet and tail. The comet is expected to become visible from Earth again in mid-November 2023.</p>
