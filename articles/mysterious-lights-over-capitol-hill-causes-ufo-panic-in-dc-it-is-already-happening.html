      <h2>Mysterious lights over Capitol Hill causes UFO panic in DC: ‘It is already happening’</h2>

<p>An apparent UFO sighting occurred above Capitol Hill this week, prompting a wave of concern about extraterrestrial activity. The sighting, which features four bright lights hovering above the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol dome, was reportedly captured by US Air Force veteran and licensed tour guide Dennis Diggins. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident has gained significant attention on social media, especially following recent congressional hearings on alleged secret government programs related to unidentified flying objects. Authorities are monitoring the situation as public interest in UFOs continues to rise.</p>

<p>On the same day, John Greenewald, Jr., a researcher and Ufologist, commented on the phenomenon, suggesting that the lights were likely reflections and not extraterrestrial in origin. His remarks aimed to provide a rational explanation amid growing public anxiety.</p>
