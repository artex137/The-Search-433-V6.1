      <h2>3I ATLAS Sparks Alien Theories After 'Sun Glitch' Claims Spread Online</h2>

<p>An interstellar object known as 3I ATLAS has sparked a wave of online theories suggesting it may have caused the Sun to 'glitch'. The speculation began on Reddit and quickly spread across TikTok, captivating thousands of users who believe the comet is an ancient alien spacecraft approaching our solar system. According to scientists, however, 3I ATLAS is a naturally occurring comet with an extraordinary path through the solar system.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it highlights the intersection of science and popular culture, prompting discussions about the nature of interstellar objects. Authorities and scientists stress that 3I ATLAS poses no danger to Earth and is being closely monitored as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025 in Chile.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I 'Oumuamua and 2I Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling on a hyperbolic orbit and will return to deep space by early 2026.</li>
    <li>Observations show it behaves like a normal comet, forming dust and gas tails.</li>
    <li>Nobody has reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers detected 3I ATLAS using the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile. The discovery gained attention as it became the third confirmed interstellar object. As the comet travels through the solar system, it is expected to pass the Sun and head back into deep space by early 2026.</p>

<p>Speculations about 3I ATLAS began circulating on social media platforms, particularly Reddit and TikTok. Users shared theories suggesting the object could be an alien spacecraft, despite scientific evidence indicating it is a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comets do not possess enough mass or energy to alter solar dynamics,” said an astrophysicist in comments to Space.com.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The theories are imaginative, but not physically possible,” the astrophysicist added, emphasizing the lack of evidence supporting claims about 3I ATLAS being anything other than a comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior incidents of speculation around celestial objects have often generated public interest and theories. The fascination with 3I ATLAS reflects ongoing cultural narratives about alien life and interstellar travel, drawing from popular media such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Interstellar." Social media platforms, particularly TikTok and Reddit, have become breeding grounds for these theories, mixing scientific facts with imaginative speculation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories around the world will continue to track 3I ATLAS as it approaches perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, later this winter. Scientists will monitor its trajectory and behavior, providing updates to the public while dispelling myths surrounding the comet.</p>
