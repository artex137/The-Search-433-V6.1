      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Amateur Astronomers Spot Continuous Motion, Surprising Experts</h2>

<p>Amateur astronomers have detected continuous motion of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, surprising experts in the field. The discovery emerged as sky-gazers shared new images and videos of the comet on various platforms, including official NASA updates and social media, sparking significant interest in the object as it moves through our solar system.</p>

<p>This finding is noteworthy because it challenges existing understanding of 3I/ATLAS. The online excitement has prompted both amateur and professional astronomers to examine the comet more closely, even as scientists have yet to confirm any of the claims regarding its motion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet</li>
  <li>Initial detection: 1 July 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile</li>
  <li>Comet's speed: Exceeds 210,000 km/h</li>
  <li>Perihelion: 30 October 2025</li>
  <li>Current visibility: Not visible to the unaided eye</li>
  <li>Distance from Earth: Previously 1.8 AU</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. NASA confirmed the comet's high speed and its interstellar origin shortly after. Following its perihelion on 30 October 2025, the comet re-entered the pre-dawn sky, becoming a subject of fascination among amateur astronomers.</p>
<p>Recent amateur footage showing suggested rotational patterns has fueled discussions in the astronomy community. Although these claims remain unverified, they have drawn significant attention online.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The intense chatter online has greatly increased interest in the swift-moving object crossing our planetary neighbourhood now and will never return,” a report noted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Changes in the coma, dust streams, and activity from the nucleus can easily produce similar deceptive images,” specialists indicated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as close encounters with interstellar objects are rare. The comet's high speed and unique composition provide valuable opportunities for scientific examination, particularly regarding its formation in a cold region of a distant star system.</p>
<p>Prior to this, astronomers have encountered few interstellar objects, making every observation critical for understanding the nature of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to release new, authorized images of 3I/ATLAS during a live event scheduled for 3 pm EST Wednesday. The astronomy community will continue to monitor and analyze the comet as more data becomes available.</p>
