      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-28 01:01 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Update: UN Planetary-Defence Drill and New Orbit Data</h2>

<p>As of Friday, 28 November 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has become the focus of a United Nations-endorsed planetary-defence drill, marking its transition from a “weird new visitor” to a subject of scientific scrutiny. There have been no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the comet's role in a global observing exercise led by the UN and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN). Authorities aim to refine the comet's trajectory and enhance coordination among observatories worldwide, ensuring preparedness for any future threats to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>It poses no threat to Earth, with a closest approach of approximately 270 million km (1.8 AU) expected on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>The official observing window for the campaign runs from 27 November 2025 to 27 January 2026.</li>
    <li>The mid-campaign check-in is scheduled for 9 December 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar comet, not alien technology.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently about 291 million km from Earth, shining at magnitude 10.2.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered. On 27 November 2025, the UN and IAWN began their global observing exercise, focusing on the comet's trajectory using data from Mars orbiters. This effort has improved predictions of the comet's path significantly. Following the observing exercise, NASA reiterated that the comet is a natural astronomical object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS has been formally adopted as the focus of the eighth official IAWN observing exercise,” said a representative from the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“NASA’s public line remains conservative: a natural comet with unusual properties, scientifically fascinating and important, but not evidence of extraterrestrial technology,” stated an agency spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet's unique composition and behavior have sparked scientific interest, particularly regarding its carbon dioxide-dominated coma and unusual brightness changes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS through the end of January 2026, with further assessments planned after the mid-campaign check-in on 9 December. The scientific community will also keep debating the comet's unusual properties and any implications they may have for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
