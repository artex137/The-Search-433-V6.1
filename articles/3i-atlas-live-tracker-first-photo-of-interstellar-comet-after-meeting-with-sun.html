      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: First photo of interstellar comet after meeting with Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has started to become visible again after its perihelion and solar conjunction in October. The Lowell Observatory in Arizona captured the first image of the comet as it emerged from behind the Sun. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers as 3I/ATLAS is expected to exhibit more changes in the coming weeks. Scientists are eager to study the comet's behavior following its close encounter with the Sun. The comet experienced unexpected changes, including a shift in color and brightness, prompting researchers to investigate further.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion in October.</li>
    <li>The Lowell Observatory captured an image of the comet after its solar conjunction.</li>
    <li>Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow, and Karl Battams, an astrophysicist, have observed changes in the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is becoming visible to small telescopes in the Northern Hemisphere.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the comet's characteristics and anomalies.</li>
    <li>NASA's observations of the comet have not been disclosed since the government shutdown on October 1.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, marking its closest approach to the Sun. Following this, the comet underwent several changes, including turning blue and becoming brighter. On October 2-3, NASA made observations of the comet using the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, but details of these observations remain undisclosed due to the government shutdown that began on October 1. As of now, the comet is re-emerging from behind the Sun, and scientists expect it to become visible to amateur astronomers soon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is visible using small telescopes,” said Qicheng Zhang from the Lowell Observatory. “It will soon start becoming visible to standard amateur telescopes across a major region of the Northern Hemisphere.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has urged astronomers to question the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, highlighting its unexpected changes as anomalies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet that has drawn attention due to its unusual properties. This encounter with the Sun is significant as it may provide insights into the behaviors of such comets. Previous encounters with other comets have also led to discoveries that have shaped our understanding of these celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it becomes more visible. Further observations and analyses are expected in the coming weeks to understand the changes it underwent during its perihelion. The status of NASA's observations remains uncertain pending the resolution of the government shutdown.</p>
