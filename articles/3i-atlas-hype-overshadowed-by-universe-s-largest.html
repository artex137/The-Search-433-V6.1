      <h2>3I/ATLAS Hype Overshadowed by Universe's Largest Structure</h2>

<p>Astronomers have reported that the excitement surrounding interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been overshadowed by the discovery of a colossal, rotating chain of galaxies, potentially the largest spinning object ever detected in the universe. This extraordinary structure lies approximately 140 million light-years from Earth and challenges existing theories on galaxy formation and the flow of matter through the cosmic web.</p>

<p>The newly mapped rotating system, which consists of a thin chain of galaxies embedded in a larger cosmic filament, could be crucial for understanding the universe's structure. Researchers highlight that this enormous system may be more significant than the recent flyby of comet 3I/ATLAS, as it provides insights into the organization of galaxies on a grand scale.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The structure is located about 140 million light-years from Earth.</li>
    <li>It consists of a thread of gas approximately 5.5 million light-years long and 117,000 light-years wide.</li>
    <li>Fourteen galaxies have been identified along the thread, all shining at roughly the same distance.</li>
    <li>The filament rotates at about 68 miles per second (110 kilometres per second).</li>
    <li>The discovery was made using MeerKAT, an array of 64 radio telescopes in South Africa.</li>
    <li>The research has been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discovery of the colossal rotating structure began during a wider survey conducted by astronomers using the MeerKAT telescope array. As the team analyzed data, they noticed a striking alignment of galaxies along a thin filament of cold hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>Initial observations revealed the unusual arrangement of galaxies, prompting further investigation. Subsequent measurements confirmed the filament's rotation and the alignment of the galaxies within it.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Lyla Jung, co-author of the study, stated, "The initial discovery itself was a surprise. We observed a striking alignment of galaxies shining at the same distance."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery adds to the growing body of research on cosmic filaments, which serve as highways for the universe, transporting gas and dark matter essential for galaxy formation. The structure's rotation may influence how galaxies along its path align and rotate, suggesting a coordinated motion akin to a cosmic dance.</p>
<p>While comet 3I/ATLAS offers a rare opportunity to study an individual object from another star system, this newly identified rotating structure enhances our understanding of galaxy organization on a much larger scale.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers plan to conduct further observations using advanced instruments to uncover additional filaments and potentially larger rotating systems, deepening our understanding of the cosmic web.</p>
