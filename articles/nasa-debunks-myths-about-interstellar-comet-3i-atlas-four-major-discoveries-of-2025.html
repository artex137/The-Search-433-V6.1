      <h2>NASA debunks myths about interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: Four major discoveries of 2025</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Chilean ATLAS telescope, is an ancient natural comet and not an alien spacecraft. The agency made this announcement during a briefing on the findings from over 20 space missions, following a period of speculation that included claims of the comet being an “alien ship” and having “non-gravitational acceleration.”</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it addresses widespread public concern and curiosity regarding the comet, which has become the brightest and most active interstellar object ever observed. NASA aims to clarify misconceptions and provide accurate information about the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth at about 269 million kilometers in December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will come closest to Jupiter at approximately 53 million kilometers in March 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at an entry speed of roughly 60 km/s, indicating it has spent billions of years in interstellar space.</li>
    <li>NASA coordinated over 20 missions to observe the comet, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>The comet's chemical composition includes an unusually high CO₂-to-H₂O ratio and a gas envelope rich in nickel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the Chilean ATLAS telescope discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, speculation about the comet's nature escalated during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. On August 2025, NASA formed a coalition of over 20 missions to observe the comet, which resulted in significant findings presented in a briefing after the shutdown.</p>
<p>NASA's briefing clarified that 3I/ATLAS is a typical long-period comet, exhibiting behaviors such as sublimating ice and forming a coma and tail. The agency emphasized that no evidence of technosignatures or anomalous maneuvers has been detected.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"We are eager to find signs of life in the universe, but 3I/ATLAS should be regarded as a comet," said NASA’s Deputy Administrator Amit Kshatriya.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This announcement follows a history of public fascination with interstellar objects. Previous discoveries, such as `Oumuamua, have prompted similar speculation about extraterrestrial life. NASA's comprehensive analysis of 3I/ATLAS aims to provide clarity and scientific understanding of such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and Jupiter. Ongoing observations will provide further insights into the comet's composition and its significance in understanding the early solar system.</p>
