      <h2>Rare images captured by ESA show interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it whizzes past Mars</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has released rare images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed Mars. The comet, which is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system, was captured by ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express spacecraft on October 7, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides astronomers with valuable insights into the formation of celestial bodies. ESA has stated that interstellar comets carry clues about worlds beyond our solar system. The images were taken from approximately 30 million kilometres away, revealing 3I/ATLAS as a bright dot surrounded by a glowing cloud of dust and gas.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Images were captured on October 7, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach its closest point to the sun on or around October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be about 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 270 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>The images were taken from a distance of about 30 million kilometres.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet has since drawn attention from both scientists and space enthusiasts. On October 7, ESA captured stunning images of the comet as it passed Mars, showcasing its coma of gas and dust. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023, and will reappear in early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS is the slightly fuzzy white dot moving downwards near the middle of the image. Despite not being designed to capture something so far away, ExoMars TGO revealed the coma of gas and dust surrounding the icy-rocky nucleus,” ESA stated in a press release.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” said Nick Thomas, principal investigator for the spacecraft’s imaging system. “The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target,” he added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The closest it will approach our planet is about 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles, or 270 million kilometers),” NASA said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered the solar system, following past discoveries of similar celestial bodies. Such comets are believed to provide essential information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor the trajectory of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun and will gather further data during its flyby. The next significant observation will occur when the comet reappears after its passage around the sun in December 2025.</p>
