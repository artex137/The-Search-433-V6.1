      <h2>UFO mystery solved as 'private firm' claims responsibility for strange activity in skies</h2>

<p>A private contractor has reportedly taken responsibility for last year's drone and "UFO" sightings over New Jersey, according to an insider. During an army conference, an individual allegedly revealed a piloted aerial vehicle that amazed attendees with its unique design and flight patterns. The contractor's representative claimed they operated in the Garden State in November 2024 to test their capabilities.</p>

<p>This development clarifies the origins of the mysterious sightings that caused alarm across the region. Authorities have reassured the public that these objects pose no national security threat, but the inability to identify them has fueled conspiracy theories. The FBI, White House, and Pentagon have all emphasized that the activity does not represent a credible threat.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in November 2024.</li>
    <li>Drone sightings began on November 13, 2024, above Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County.</li>
    <li>Sightings continued statewide into early December 2024.</li>
    <li>Many reports of mysterious drones were attributed to hobbyists and private citizens, according to the FAA.</li>
    <li>Conference participants received approval from Fort Rucker leadership, which set strict guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The wave of alleged drone sightings began on November 13, 2024, above Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, New Jersey. The sightings persisted across the state until early December. During this time, hundreds of reports emerged, prompting widespread speculation and concern among residents.</p>

<p>In January 2025, the Federal Aviation Administration disclosed that many reports of mysterious drones were linked to hobbyists and recreational pilots, aiming to address public fears.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” a worker from the undisclosed contractor reportedly told a small group after the presentation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "It would definitely have to be cleared,” a source added, referring to the approval process for the conference attendees.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Last year's sightings have fueled various conspiracy theories, including claims linking the drones to 'Project Blue Beam,' which suggests a staged technological simulation of the Second Coming. Additionally, some Republican politicians speculated that the drones could be linked to hostile nations such as Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea. Despite these theories, officials have maintained that the activity does not pose a credible threat to national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor airspace activity and investigate any further reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. The contractor's operations remain undisclosed under a government confidentiality agreement.</p>
