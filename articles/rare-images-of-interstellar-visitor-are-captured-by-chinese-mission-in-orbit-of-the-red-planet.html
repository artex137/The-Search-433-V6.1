      <h2>Rare images of interstellar visitor are captured by Chinese mission in orbit of the red planet</h2>

<p>The Administração Espacial Nacional of China (CNSA) has confirmed that its Tianwen-1 probe has successfully captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS while orbiting Mars. This significant event occurred when the comet was approximately 30 million kilometers from the spacecraft, marking the first time a probe in orbit around another planet has visually documented an interstellar object.</p>

<p>This achievement highlights advancements in planetary astronomy and enhances the ability to track high-speed celestial objects. The Tianwen-1 probe, which has completed its primary Martian exploration objectives, adapted its instruments to capture images of the rapidly moving comet, providing crucial data for the global scientific community studying interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tianwen-1 probe operated by CNSA</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS captured at a distance of 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet's speed: 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of 3I/ATLAS: 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Length of comet's tail: approximately 56,000 kilometers</li>
    <li>First images taken during the comet's close approach to Mars</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Tianwen-1 probe has been active in orbit around Mars since its arrival in February 2021. The successful imaging of 3I/ATLAS occurred during a narrow time window when the comet was transiting close to the planet, requiring precise navigation and engineering maneuvers.</p>
<p>Prior to capturing the images, mission engineers conducted extensive simulations and tests to ensure that the probe's camera could take the shot at the right moment. This meticulous planning allowed the Tianwen-1 to adjust its orientation and track the comet effectively.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The successful operation validates the tracking algorithms developed by CNSA, proving that satellites designed for planetary observation can function as improvised space telescopes when necessary,” a CNSA representative said.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each of these discoveries has prompted scientists to reassess the frequency of interstellar matter visiting the solar system.</p>
<p>The classification of 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar comet is based on its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not bound by the Sun's gravity and will pass through only once before returning to interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The images and data collected will contribute to ongoing research into the formation and composition of celestial bodies from other star systems. Future analyses will focus on understanding the implications of these findings for galactic statistics and the characteristics of interstellar objects.</p>
