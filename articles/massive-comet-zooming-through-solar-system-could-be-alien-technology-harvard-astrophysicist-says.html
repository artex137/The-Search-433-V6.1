      <h2>Massive comet zooming through solar system could be alien technology, Harvard astrophysicist says</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/ATLAS, traveling outside the solar system and approaching Earth, is much larger than previously thought, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The comet weighs over <strong>33 billion tons</strong> and measures at least <strong>5 kilometers</strong> across. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it raises questions about the origins of the comet and its composition. Loeb suggests that 3I/ATLAS could be an artifact of alien technology rather than a natural celestial body. NASA has been urged to observe the comet more closely to refine understanding of its properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS weighs over <strong>33 billion tons</strong>.</li>
  <li>It spans at least <strong>5 kilometers</strong> in diameter.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object detected, following Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
  <li>The comet will pass within <strong>1.67 million miles</strong> of Mars' orbit next week.</li>
  <li>Avi Loeb has called for NASA to use the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to observe the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023. Since then, scientists have gathered data indicating that the comet is shedding large amounts of carbon dioxide and dust as it approaches the Sun. Loeb and his team have observed a slight "non-gravitational acceleration" in its movement due to outgassing, suggesting it is more massive than early estimates indicated.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "This makes 3I/ATLAS three to five orders of magnitude more massive than the previous two interstellar objects we’ve observed."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "We should not decide about the nature of 3I/ATLAS based on the chemical composition of its skin. For the same reason, we should not judge a book by its cover."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is a significant discovery in the field of astronomy, following the detections of Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These interstellar visitors have sparked interest in the potential for alien technology or non-natural origins of celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa is expected to consider Loeb's request to observe 3I/ATLAS with the HiRISE camera to gather more data on the comet's size and composition.</p>
