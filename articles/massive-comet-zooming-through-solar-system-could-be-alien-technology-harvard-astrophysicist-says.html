      <h2>Massive comet zooming through solar system could be alien technology, Harvard astrophysicist says</h2>

<p>A comet traveling outside the solar system, named 3I/ATLAS, is larger than previously estimated and is approaching Earth, according to a report by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The comet, which weighs over 33 billion tons and spans at least 3.1 miles across, was discovered earlier this month and has prompted discussions about its potential origins.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions regarding the nature of interstellar objects. Loeb claims that 3I/ATLAS could be an artifact of alien technology rather than a natural body. Authorities are currently monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was spotted in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to weigh over <strong>33 billion tons</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS spans at least <strong>3.1 miles</strong> across.</li>
    <li>It will pass within <strong>1.67 million miles</strong> of Mars' orbit next week.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object detected, after Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers discovered the comet 3I/ATLAS entering the solar system. Recent measurements have indicated that its nucleus is much more massive than initially thought, leading to new calculations about its movement. The comet is shedding large amounts of carbon dioxide and dust as it approaches the Sun, which has been noted by scientists.</p>

<p>Next week, 3I/ATLAS is expected to come close to both Jupiter and Venus while passing near Mars. Loeb has called for NASA to utilize the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to gather more data on the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "This makes 3I/ATLAS three to five orders of magnitude more massive than the previous two interstellar objects we’ve observed."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also mentioned, "We should not decide about the nature of 3I/ATLAS based on the chemical composition of its skin. For the same reason, we should not judge a book by its cover."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar visitor detected, following Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The previous two objects received significant attention for their unusual characteristics, with Oumuamua sparking debate about its potential artificial origins. The increased interest in interstellar objects highlights the ongoing exploration of our solar system and beyond.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars. The agency may utilize its HiRISE camera to gather more detailed information about the comet's structure and behavior in the coming days.</p>
