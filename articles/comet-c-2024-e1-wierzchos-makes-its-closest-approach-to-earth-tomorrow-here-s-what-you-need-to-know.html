      <h2>Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos) to Make Closest Approach to Earth Tomorrow</h2>

<p>The comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos) will make its closest approach to Earth on February 17, 2024, flying approximately 94 million miles (151 million kilometers) from the planet. The event, known as perigee, poses no threat to Earth, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>This close encounter is significant for astronomy enthusiasts. The comet's proximity offers a chance to observe it, although visibility will depend on location and equipment. The comet recently reached its closest approach to the sun on January 20, 2024, which increased its brightness as gases released from its nucleus created a visible coma.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: February 17, 2024</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 94 million miles (151 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Brightness magnitude: +8.2</li>
    <li>Location in the sky: Southern constellation of Grus</li>
    <li>Visibility: Less than 20 degrees above the southwestern horizon at sunset</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 20, 2024, C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos) made its closest approach to the sun, resulting in an increase in brightness due to the vaporization of frozen materials. This event led to the formation of a coma around the comet.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, on February 17, the comet will reach its perigee, allowing observers to potentially view it, depending on the equipment used.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet will pose no threat to our planet,” said astronomers regarding the upcoming flyby.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos) is one of several comets observed in recent years. Its brightness and trajectory have been monitored by the Comet Observation Database (COBS), which is maintained by the Crni Vrh Observatory in Slovenia. Observers note that as the comet moves away from the sun, its brightness is expected to diminish.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos) continues its trajectory, it will pass into the faint constellation Eridanus by early March 2024, where it will be positioned higher in the evening sky. Its brightness may dim beyond +8, making it a potential target for telescopic observation.</p>
