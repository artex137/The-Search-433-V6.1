      <h2>Obama says aliens exist, but not at Nevada’s Area 51</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama stated in a podcast interview on Saturday that aliens are real, but they are not located at Nevada’s Area 51. Obama made these remarks during an appearance on YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen’s show, although he did not provide any evidence or details regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This statement comes amid ongoing public fascination with UFOs and the secretive nature of Area 51, a military installation long associated with conspiracy theories about aliens. Authorities continue to investigate sightings and reports of unidentified aerial phenomena, as interest in the topic grows.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interview conducted on February 15, 2026.</li>
    <li>Obama stated he has not seen extraterrestrials but believes they exist.</li>
    <li>Area 51 is approximately 145 kilometres northwest of Las Vegas.</li>
    <li>The facility was established in 1955 for testing high-tech aircraft.</li>
    <li>In 2013, the CIA declassified documents confirming Area 51's existence.</li>
    <li>Public interest surged in 2019 with a viral social media event to "storm" Area 51.</li>
    <li>Polling found that 52% of Americans believe extraterrestrial life exists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Area 51 was established in 1955 as a testing site for high-altitude aircraft, including the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes. The U.S. government did not publicly acknowledge the site's existence until 2013 when the CIA released declassified documents.</p>

<p>In September 2019, a social media event created by Matty Roberts attracted over 2 million participants who humorously pledged to storm Area 51 to "see them aliens." This event evolved into the Alienstock music festival, attracting thousands to the nearby communities of Rachel and Hiko.</p>

<p>Obama's podcast interview took place on February 15, 2026, where he reiterated his belief in the existence of extraterrestrial life, distancing it from Area 51.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re not being kept in Area 51, there’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” Obama said during the interview.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When asked what his first question was upon becoming president, Obama replied with a laugh, “Where are the aliens?”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has been a focal point for conspiracy theories surrounding UFOs and extraterrestrial life for decades. The U.S. government's secrecy regarding the site has fueled speculation and a subculture of alien enthusiasts, with businesses like the Area 51 Alien Center capitalizing on this interest. A 2019 Ipsos poll showed that 25% of Americans believed that crashed UFOs were held at Area 51.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue monitoring UFO sightings and reports as public interest grows. Investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena remain ongoing, but no new information has been disclosed regarding extraterrestrial life or its connection to Area 51.</p>
