      <h2>Three More Chinese Astronauts Stranded in Space Following Crew Return</h2>

<p>Three Chinese astronauts, known as taikonauts, have become stranded aboard the Tiangong space station after the return of their colleagues on November 14. The Shenzhou-21 crew, consisting of Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang, currently have no safe way to return to Earth.</p>

<p>This situation raises concerns about China's space protocols, which experts say may have flaws that jeopardize astronaut safety. The Chinese Manned Space Agency (CMSA) is reportedly preparing to launch a replacement return capsule, Shenzhou-22, to the Tiangong space station as early as November 24.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Stranded astronauts: Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, Zhang Hongzhang</li>
    <li>Launch date of Shenzhou-21: October 31</li>
    <li>Return of Shenzhou-20 crew: November 14</li>
    <li>Duration of Shenzhou-20 mission: 204 days</li>
    <li>Potential launch date for Shenzhou-22: November 24</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Shenzhou-21 crew launched into space on October 31 to take over from the Shenzhou-20 crew. The Shenzhou-20 crew was originally scheduled to return on November 5. However, their return was delayed due to damage from suspected space junk. After tests revealed a crack in their return capsule's viewing port, the Shenzhou-20 crew used the Shenzhou-21's return capsule instead and successfully returned to Earth on November 14.</p>

<p>As a result, the Shenzhou-21 crew remains on the Tiangong space station without a means of returning home. Experts have noted the need for a reliable emergency protocol for such situations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I'm very glad that they (Shenzhou-20 crew) got home, but it is a bit disconcerting that the replacement crew apparently does not have a vehicle to come back to Earth," said Victoria Samson, chief director of space security and stability at the Secure World Foundation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is not the first of its kind. Previous cases of astronauts being stranded have occurred on the International Space Station (ISS), including incidents involving NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, and Frank Rubio, who spent over a year in space. Unlike these situations, the stranded taikonauts on the Tiangong have no immediate option for a safe return.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The CMSA is expected to launch the Shenzhou-22 capsule soon. It is currently unclear if the stranded crew can use the damaged Shenzhou-20 capsule in an emergency. Further details about the situation remain undisclosed.</p>
