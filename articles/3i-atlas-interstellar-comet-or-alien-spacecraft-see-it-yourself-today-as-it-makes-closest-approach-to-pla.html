      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet Approaches Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is making its closest approach to Earth overnight between December 18 and 19, 2023. At its nearest point, the comet will be approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) away, according to NASA.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study material from beyond the solar system. NASA has released new images of the comet, captured by the Europa Clipper spacecraft, which was not originally assigned to observe 3I/ATLAS. The images help confirm that the object is a natural comet and not evidence of alien technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches closest approach at 1 a.m. EST on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at about 246,000 kilometers per hour (153,000 miles per hour).</li>
    <li>Images were taken by the Europa Clipper spacecraft during a seven-hour observation on November 6, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey.</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed that the comet poses no risk to Earth.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project will host a livestream starting at 11 p.m. EST on December 18, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 6, 2023, the Europa Clipper spacecraft captured images of 3I/ATLAS during a coincidental flyby. The spacecraft was approximately 102 million miles away from the comet at that time.</p>
<p>The comet is currently moving through the inner solar system and is set to reach its closest point to Earth in the early hours of December 19, 2023, before continuing its path toward Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The observation of 3I/ATLAS provides a rare chance to study material from beyond the solar system,” NASA stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There is no evidence to suggest that 3I/ATLAS is artificial. It is classified as a natural interstellar comet,” the agency added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Studying such comets can help scientists understand how planetary systems form around other stars.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the detailed ultraviolet data from the Europa Clipper. Results will be released once processing is complete, providing further insights into the comet's structure and composition.</p>
