      <h2>The Allure of the Interstellar: Why Virgin Galactic's 'ATLAS Viewing Flights' Remain a Celestial Dream for Now</h2>

<p>On October 6, 2025, Virgin Galactic has confirmed that its focus remains on suborbital tourism and not on dedicated astronomical observation flights for interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The company, which aims to provide private citizens with weightlessness and views of Earth, is not currently offering flights to observe the comet, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope.</p>

<p>This situation underlines the challenges facing the commercial spaceflight industry, which is still developing. While 3I/ATLAS has captured the attention of scientists and the public, the technology and operations needed for specialized astronomical flights are not yet in place. Virgin Galactic’s current operations are focused on scaling suborbital experiences.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will pass Earth at a safe distance on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Virgin Galactic's last commercial flight occurred in June 2024.</li>
    <li>The first Delta class flights are scheduled to begin in 2026.</li>
    <li>Tickets for Delta class flights are expected to cost around $600,000.</li>
    <li>Virgin Galactic plans to operate twice weekly flights by 2028.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS, confirming its interstellar origin. The comet made a close approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, and will reach its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 30, 2025. It is set to pass Earth safely on December 19, 2025. Virgin Galactic's last commercial flight took place in June 2024, and the company is transitioning to a new generation of Delta class spaceships, with operations expected to ramp up over the coming years.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The idea of specialized astronomical viewing flights presents a fascinating thought experiment for the space tourism market,” Virgin Galactic stated. “While our current focus is on suborbital space tourism, the potential for future offerings remains an interesting prospect.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS marks it as the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system. The commercial space industry is evolving, with companies like Blue Origin and SpaceX expanding their offerings beyond suborbital flights. Virgin Galactic’s current suborbital model faces increasing competition and investor skepticism, especially as the market for space tourism is projected to grow significantly in the coming years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Virgin Galactic is expected to continue developing its Delta class spaceships, with the first flights anticipated in 2026. The company may explore options for specialized astronomical tours in the future, depending on market demand and technological advancements.</p>
