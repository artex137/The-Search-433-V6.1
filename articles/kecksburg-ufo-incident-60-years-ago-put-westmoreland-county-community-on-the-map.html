      <h2>Kecksburg UFO incident 60 years ago put Westmoreland County community on the map</h2>

<p>On December 9, 1965, at approximately 4:45 p.m., residents of Kecksburg, an unincorporated community in Westmoreland County, reported hearing a thud after witnessing a bright light streak across the sky. The incident drew attention from multiple states, including Michigan and Ohio, where witnesses described similar sightings, and resulted in a fire in a wooded area near Elyria, Ohio.</p>

<p>The Kecksburg incident has remained significant over the decades, generating interest and speculation about unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Local authorities and the Pennsylvania State Police responded by investigating the area, but they found no evidence of a crash or fire. This event has since contributed to Kecksburg's identity, with a yearly UFO festival that attracts visitors and raises funds for local services.</p>
