      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Makes Historic Close Approach to Earth Friday</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has made a historic close approach to Earth on Friday, November 30, 2025. The comet was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey in Chile. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This close encounter is significant as it marks only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, according to NASA. Astronomers and researchers have utilized both space-based and ground-based observatories to track the comet's trajectory and analyze its composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is approximately 178 million miles (286 million kilometers) from Earth during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft provided additional observations of the comet.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass within about 33 million miles (53 million kilometers) of Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
    <li>It is expected to exit our solar system entirely after this trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 1, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is first detected by the ATLAS survey in Chile.</p>
<p>October 30, 2025: The comet makes its closest approach to the Sun, resulting in increased outgassing.</p>
<p>November 30, 2025: NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope captures images of the comet during its close approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These measurements help pinpoint the comet’s composition and provide valuable clues about the conditions of its formation,” scientists stated regarding the observations made by the Europa Clipper spacecraft.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object identified, highlighting ongoing advancements in the detection and study of near-Earth objects. The previous interstellar objects, 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also spurred interest in understanding the origins and compositions of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its flyby, comet 3I/ATLAS will continue its journey through the solar system, with projections indicating it will pass near Jupiter in March 2026 before moving back into interstellar space.</p>
