      <h2>Polarization anomaly of 3I/ATLAS reveals origin conditions absent in our Solar System</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed a unique polarization pattern, revealing dust unlike any known in the Solar System, according to recent observations made at the Gemini Observatory in Chile. This comet, discovered in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Hawaii, is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>These findings are significant as they suggest that 3I/ATLAS originated under conditions that differ markedly from those in our own Solar System. Researchers are now analyzing its unique properties to better understand the formation and evolution of comets in other planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025 by ATLAS in Hawaii</li>
    <li>Observations conducted: August 26, 2025, at Gemini South, Cerro Pachón, Chile</li>
    <li>Deep negative polarization observed: -2.7% at a phase angle of 7°</li>
    <li>Inversion angle: Approximately 17°</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2025, at about 30 million km (19 million miles)</li>
    <li>Diameter estimates: Between 0.3 and 5.6 km (0.2–3.5 miles)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, marking it as the third interstellar comet identified. Observations in August 2025 revealed its unusual polarization characteristics, indicating fundamentally different dust properties compared to Solar System comets. On September 7, 2025, imaging showed a shift in the comet's coma from reddish to green, attributed to an increase in cyanide molecules. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The polarization anomaly observed in 3I/ATLAS suggests that it carries material forged under different physical and chemical conditions, in the disk of another star,” said a spokesperson from the International Gemini Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects had been confirmed in modern astronomical history. The discoveries of ‘Oumuamua and Borisov garnered significant attention for their distinct characteristics, with 3I/ATLAS now adding to the understanding of interstellar bodies. The unique properties of 3I/ATLAS highlight the diversity of materials that may exist in different planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars, utilizing data from various telescopes to gather more information about its composition and behavior. The upcoming close encounter is expected to provide valuable insights into the comet’s nucleus and its origins.</p>
