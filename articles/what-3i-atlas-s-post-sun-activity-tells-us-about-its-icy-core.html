      <h2>What 3I/ATLAS’s post-Sun activity tells us about its icy core</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has shown significant post-Sun activity after passing its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, as it releases gases and forms visible jets. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's activity.</p>

<p>This development is important for scientists studying the composition and behavior of comets. Authorities are using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope to refine models of comet nuclei and their activity in response to solar heating.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The nucleus size is estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Gases released include carbon dioxide, cyanide, and some water vapour.</li>
    <li>Visible jets of dust and gas indicate complex chemistry and uneven ice distribution.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be observable from Earth again starting December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun, which triggered its brightening and activity. The warming from solar radiation caused frozen gases on the comet’s surface to sublime, forming a bright coma and visible tails. This activity has continued as the comet moves away from the Sun, indicating a sustained release of gases.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sustained outgassing after the solar encounter suggests the core still has enough ice to power jets far from the Sun,” scientists noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This behavior supports existing models that depict comet nuclei as dirty iceballs. The findings from 3I/ATLAS refine the understanding of comet composition and their physical structure, as well as how they respond to solar heating.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS is set to be observable again in December 2025, scientists plan to collect more data using advanced telescopes to confirm initial findings and learn more about the comet’s icy core.</p>
