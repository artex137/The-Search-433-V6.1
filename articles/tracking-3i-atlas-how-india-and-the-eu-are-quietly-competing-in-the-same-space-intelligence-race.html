      <h2>'Tracking 3I/ATLAS': How India and the EU are quietly competing in the same space intelligence race</h2>

<p>India and the European Union have initiated a parallel race in space intelligence, focusing on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. This effort has unfolded over recent years, with both regions emphasizing scientific autonomy and data independence rather than military competition.</p>

<p>This collaboration matters as it fosters a competitive edge in space research while promoting global access to astronomical data. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), and the ARIES Observatory are at the forefront of this initiative, providing critical data to enhance global trajectory models. The European Space Agency (ESA) has integrated its observatories into a unified network, allowing for comprehensive data collection and analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is being studied by ISRO and ESA.</li>
    <li>ISRO operates with a smaller budget compared to its US and Chinese counterparts.</li>
    <li>ESA has integrated observatories like La Silla, Paranal, and Calar Alto into a unified observation network.</li>
    <li>Data from the Gaia and Rosetta missions have improved Europe’s comet studies.</li>
    <li>Both regions expanded data continuity frameworks following a NASA data blackout during a US government shutdown.</li>
    <li>AI-based comet-tracking algorithms are being developed through collaboration between European universities and Indian research hubs, such as IUCAA in Pune.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, India and the EU have focused on comet 3I/ATLAS, conducting independent sky surveys and collaborating on data analysis. Following the NASA data blackout, both regions took steps to ensure continuous observation of 3I/ATLAS, receiving praise from the international astronomy community. Ongoing collaboration includes the development of AI-based algorithms to enhance data accuracy.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The India–EU relationship is built on open-source data exchange and academic transparency,” a representative from ISRO stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This approach reinforces the principle that no single nation should ‘own’ interstellar research,” an ESA official commented.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The collaborative efforts between India and the EU reflect a growing trend in distributed astronomy, where multiple nations share partial datasets to advance space research. This model contrasts with the more militarized space race between the US and China, emphasizing civilian-led initiatives in space science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the study of interstellar objects continues to evolve, India and the EU are expected to strengthen their collaborative frameworks, enhancing their observational capabilities and further reducing reliance on data from the US and China.</p>
