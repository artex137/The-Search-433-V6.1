      <h2>Nasa to expand 2025 observations of enigmatic 3I Atlas comet, seeking interstellar origins</h2>

<p>NASA has announced plans to expand its observational campaign for the comet 3I Atlas in 2025, involving international space agencies and advanced telescopic technology. The comet, which has drawn significant attention for its unusual trajectory, was first identified in late 2024. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This initiative is crucial as scientists aim to gather unprecedented data about 3I Atlas, which may originate from beyond our solar system. Researchers are particularly interested in its composition and dynamics, as the comet could provide insights into cosmic formation processes. NASA will utilize both space-based and ground observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope, to maximize data collection during the comet’s closest approach to the Sun and Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I Atlas was identified in late 2024.</li>
    <li>Nasa is leading a global observational campaign in 2025.</li>
    <li>The James Webb Space Telescope will play a significant role in the observations.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits a highly eccentric orbit, indicating it is not bound to the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I Atlas is only the third interstellar object definitively identified, after ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Scientists aim to analyze its chemical composition and trajectory.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a velocity of 57 km/s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Late 2024: Initial observations of Comet 3I Atlas reveal its unusual trajectory and characteristics.</p>
<p>2025: NASA and other space agencies prepare for an intensified observational campaign, focusing on the comet’s approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>2026: A rare encounter with Jupiter is scheduled to modify the comet's trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The journey of Comet 3I Atlas through our solar system represents a rare astronomical event,” NASA officials said. “This unique characteristic fuels much of the scientific excitement and planning for the 2025 observation period.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I Atlas is significant as it may provide a glimpse into the materials and conditions that exist beyond our solar system. Prior interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have sparked interest in understanding the diversity of planetary formation processes across the galaxy. Observations of these celestial bodies help refine models of stellar evolution and the mechanisms behind planet formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will conduct detailed studies of 3I Atlas in 2025, focusing on its chemical composition and trajectory. This ongoing research aims to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their implications for cosmic origins.</p>
