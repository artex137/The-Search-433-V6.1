      <h2>The four most advanced telescopes all agree: There is an anomaly approaching Earth</h2>

<p>A newly discovered comet, named 3I/ATLAS, has been identified as an interstellar object approaching the Solar System. Discovered in mid-2025, astronomers have been observing it using four advanced telescopes: Hubble, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), SPHEREx, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). There are no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it marks the third interstellar visitor to enter the Solar System. Observations have revealed unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including high levels of carbon dioxide. Scientists are currently analyzing data to better understand its origins and implications for planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Identified on July 1, 2025; first traces detected in May 2025.</li>
    <li>Located 6 astronomical units (AU) away from the Sun at the time of initial detection.</li>
    <li>Core diameter of 3I/ATLAS is approximately 2.8 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Gas and dust cloud around the comet measures about 23 kilometers wide.</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Potential close encounter with the Juno spacecraft in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The official identification of 3I/ATLAS occurred on July 1, 2025. However, TESS data shows that the first signs of the comet were detected in May of that year, when it was located beyond Jupiter’s orbit. The early activity of 3I/ATLAS was confirmed by JWST and SPHEREx in August 2025.</p>

<p>As of now, spectroscopic analyses have indicated a significant carbon dioxide presence in the comet's atmosphere, with a ratio of carbon dioxide to water vapor recorded at 8:1. This ratio is among the highest ever observed in a comet.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is anticipated to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, after which it will be positioned behind the Sun from Earth's perspective, limiting observations. The scientific community is particularly interested in data that may be captured by spacecraft in Mars orbit during this period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unusual structure, early activity, and chemical differences of 3I/ATLAS raise new questions for scientists about the nature of interstellar objects,” said a spokesperson from the scientific team monitoring the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet observed in the Solar System, following previous discoveries. The study of such objects provides insights into the formation of planetary systems outside the Solar System. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS may help scientists understand the conditions present in interstellar environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and eventually Earth. The upcoming close encounter with the Juno spacecraft in March 2026 is anticipated to offer significant opportunities for further study of this unique celestial object.</p>
