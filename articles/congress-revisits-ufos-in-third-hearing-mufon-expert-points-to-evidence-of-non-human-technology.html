      <h2>Congress revisits UFOs in third hearing, MUFON expert points to evidence of ‘non-human technology’</h2>

<p>Congress has held its third hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) as discussions shift from the existence of UFOs to their potential implications. Ron James, a researcher with the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), spoke during the hearing, which took place in Washington, D.C., on [date not disclosed]. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the hearings.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it reflects a change in the U.S. government's approach to UAPs. Officials now refer to “non-human intelligence” instead of extraterrestrials, indicating a broader acceptance of unidentified objects in the sky. James noted that while the government has acknowledged these phenomena, full transparency remains elusive due to security and classified program restrictions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing held in Washington, D.C. on [date not disclosed].</li>
    <li>Ron James represents the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON).</li>
    <li>James claims that advanced non-human intelligence has existed throughout history.</li>
    <li>Reports have surfaced regarding recovered craft and unusual materials.</li>
    <li>James anticipates a gradual release of information regarding UAPs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the hearing, Ron James presented findings that indicate a shift in the government’s dialogue surrounding UFOs. He emphasized that the debate has evolved from whether UFOs are real to understanding their significance and origins. James also highlighted that insiders in Washington have been briefed privately about UAPs, although many details remain classified.</p>

<p>James expressed optimism about ongoing efforts for transparency but cautioned that the public may not receive full disclosure soon. He expects that information, including potential confirmations of microbial life beyond Earth, will be released gradually.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There’s very little dispute anymore among people really paying attention,” James said. “Some kind of advanced non-human intelligence has been with us from the beginning of time.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The bottom line is there are people in D.C. dedicated to bringing as much of this knowledge as possible to the public,” James added. “But it’s coming slower than anyone wants.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing is part of a series of congressional discussions aimed at demystifying UAPs, following increased public interest and governmental acknowledgment of unidentified aerial phenomena. Previous hearings have focused on the existence of UAPs, while this session emphasized understanding their implications and the nature of the intelligence behind them.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress plans to continue its investigations into UAPs, with expectations of further hearings and gradual information releases from government agencies. The timeline for full disclosure remains uncertain.</p>
