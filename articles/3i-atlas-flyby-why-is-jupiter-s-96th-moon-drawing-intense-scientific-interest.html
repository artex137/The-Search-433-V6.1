      <h2>3I/ATLAS flyby: Why is Jupiter’s 96th Moon drawing intense scientific interest?</h2>

<p>As 2026 unfolds, the 3I/ATLAS flyby is capturing the attention of scientists as the interstellar comet approaches Jupiter. The comet is on track to influence the formation of a potential new moon for the gas giant before it exits the solar system, marking a significant event in astronomical history.</p>

<p>This flyby is important because it may provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects. According to Harward’s Professor Avi Loeb, the comet’s trajectory, influenced by non-gravitational accelerations during its perihelion in 2025, is aligned to brush the edge of Jupiter’s gravitational sphere. Scientists are closely monitoring this event, which could result in the discovery of Jupiter’s 96th moon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to approach Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
    <li>Jupiter currently has 95 known moons.</li>
    <li>The comet’s trajectory was influenced by non-gravitational accelerations during its 2025 perihelion.</li>
    <li>Professor Avi Loeb has suggested that a new moon could appear in a stable orbit after March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet will exit the solar system and will not return.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2025, 3I/ATLAS reaches its perihelion, a point in its orbit where it is closest to the Sun. This event causes non-gravitational accelerations that influence its trajectory. As it approaches Jupiter in March 2026, scientists observe the potential for the comet to affect the formation of a new moon.</p>

<p>After March 16, if a new moon arises from this interaction, it may signal a technological signature linked to the interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If a new 96th moon suddenly appears in a stable orbit, we will have discovered a clear technological signature from the interstellar visitor,” said Professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS flyby is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about interstellar objects and their interactions with celestial bodies in our solar system. This event may contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics between comets and planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the flyby approaches, scientists will continue to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and its interaction with Jupiter, preparing for potential discoveries related to the formation of a new moon.</p>
