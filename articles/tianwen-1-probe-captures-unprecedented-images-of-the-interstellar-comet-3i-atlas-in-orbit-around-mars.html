      <h2>Tianwen-1 probe captures unprecedented images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in orbit around Mars</h2>

<p>The Tianwen-1 probe, operated by the China National Space Administration (CNSA), has captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its close passage to Mars on October 3, 2025. The comet was approximately 30 million kilometers away from the spacecraft at the time of the capture. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This observation marks a significant milestone in the study of celestial bodies outside the Solar System. Authorities are now analyzing the images, which reveal details about the comet's structure and composition, offering insights into its origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Tianwen-1 to 3I/ATLAS: 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet speed: 58 km/s</li>
    <li>Diameter of comet nucleus: 5.6 km</li>
    <li>Brightness: 10,000 to 100,000 times dimmer than Martian targets</li>
    <li>Initial detection of 3I/ATLAS: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Launch date of Tianwen-1: July 2020</li>
    <li>Operational status of Tianwen-1: In orbit since February 2021</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile detects the comet 3I/ATLAS. The object, initially out of reach for ground-based telescopes, prompted the Tianwen-1 team to adjust their mission in September 2025 to include observation of the comet. The probe successfully captures images of the comet from October 1 to 4, 2025.</p>

<p>The images are processed and transformed into an animation by CNSA, highlighting features such as the comet's nucleus and coma, along with a rare antitail phenomenon. The findings indicate that the comet's chemical composition differs from that of solar system objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This operation validates remote imaging techniques in hostile environments,” said a CNSA representative. “The data collected will expand our understanding of cosmic visitors.” 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following Oumuamua and Borisov. The comet's hyperbolic orbit confirms its external origin, and its unique brightness challenges existing models of long-period comets. The mission contributes to the growing knowledge of interstellar objects and their frequency in the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing analysis of the images will provide further insights into the comet's chemical composition. Future studies may include collaborations with NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) as the comet continues its trajectory out of the Solar System.</p>
