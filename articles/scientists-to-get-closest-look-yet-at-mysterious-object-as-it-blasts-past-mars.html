      <h2>Scientists to get closest look yet at mysterious object as it blasts past Mars</h2>

<p>A rare visitor from beyond our solar system, comet 3I/Atlas, is set to make a close approach to Mars on Friday, October 6, 2025. The comet will pass within 18 million miles (29 million kilometres) of the Red Planet at a speed of 193,000 mph (310,000 kph). There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This close encounter provides a unique opportunity for scientists to study the interstellar object. Both the European Space Agency's (ESA) satellites orbiting Mars and NASA's rovers are prepared to observe the comet. Discovered in July, 3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar object known to have entered the inner solar system, and it poses no threat to Earth or other planets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> October 6, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> 18 million miles (29 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 193,000 mph (310,000 kph)</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> European Space Agency, NASA</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> Expected by the end of October</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 2025, at a distance of 167 million miles (269 million kilometres)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025. Since its discovery, it has been on a trajectory that will take it through the inner solar system. As it approaches Mars, both ESA and NASA have mobilized their assets to observe the comet closely.</p>
<p>The comet's closest approach to the Sun is anticipated for late October, followed by its closest pass to Earth in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is an extraordinary opportunity to study an interstellar object as it travels through our solar system,” said an ESA spokesperson. “The data collected will enhance our understanding of the origins of such comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is significant as it is only the third known interstellar object to traverse the inner solar system. Previous interstellar visitors, such as 'Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the composition and behavior of material from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun and Earth. Observations from the ESA's Juice spacecraft will take place throughout November 2025, further contributing to the understanding of this unique comet.</p>
