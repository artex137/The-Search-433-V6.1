      <h2>Radio Signals Detected From Comet 3I/ATLAS — What Its Interstellar Origins Reveal</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has been under observation since its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. The comet has garnered attention for its blue-green glow and the detection of radio signals, confirming its natural composition, according to a statement from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers as it sheds light on the origins and composition of interstellar objects. Authorities plan to continue monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Speed upon Discovery:</strong> 137,000 MPH</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Objects:</strong> 1I/’Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first observed Comet 3I/ATLAS entering the inner solar system. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory indicated that it is not bound to the sun, marking it as the third recorded interstellar object. The comet reached its perihelion, or closest approach to the sun, on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 210 million kilometers.</p>

<p>In recent observations, a radio telescope detected signals from the comet, confirming its status as a natural celestial body. This finding has led to increased interest in its chemical composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of radio signals from Comet 3I/ATLAS establishes that it is a natural comet and nothing else,” stated a representative from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn comparisons to previous interstellar objects, particularly 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which were also observed as they passed through the solar system. Unlike these earlier comets, 3I/ATLAS is believed to have originated from the Milky Way’s “thick disk,” suggesting a different evolutionary path.</p>

<p>Scientific studies have indicated that Comet 3I/ATLAS may be significantly older than typical comets, potentially offering insights into the formation of the solar system and the building blocks of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS in the lead-up to its closest approach to Earth, aiming to gather more data on its composition and origins. The comet will also pass by Jupiter in March 2026 before leaving the solar system.</p>
