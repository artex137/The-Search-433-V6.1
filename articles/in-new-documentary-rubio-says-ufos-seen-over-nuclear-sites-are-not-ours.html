      <h2>In New Documentary, Rubio Says UFOs Seen Over Nuclear Sites Are ‘Not Ours’</h2>

<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stated in a new documentary that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been repeatedly observed over U.S. nuclear facilities, asserting that these objects are “not ours.” The documentary, titled “The Age of Disclosure,” features interviews with 34 current and former members of the U.S. government, military, and intelligence communities, and is set for worldwide release on November 21.</p>

<p>The documentary highlights the growing concern regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), the official term for UFOs. Authorities, including Rubio, have called for increased transparency about these phenomena as bipartisan congressional hearings and the proposed UAP Disclosure Act gain traction in Washington.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: "The Age of Disclosure"</li>
    <li>Release date: November 21</li>
    <li>Director: Dan Farah</li>
    <li>Runtime: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Number of interview subjects: 34 current and former U.S. officials</li>
    <li>Initial screening: SXSW Film Festival</li>
    <li>Theatrical run: Limited screenings in New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The documentary has been produced over nearly three years in secrecy. It debuted at the SXSW Film Festival before its upcoming release on Prime Video. Dan Farah gained access to high-ranking officials to discuss UAPs, which he claims has been a subject of significant government secrecy.</p>

<p>In the documentary, Rubio claims that there have been multiple instances of unidentified objects in restricted airspace over nuclear facilities. Jay Stratton, former head of the UAP Task Force, also shares his firsthand experiences with non-human craft and beings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities — and it’s not ours.” — Secretary of State Marco Rubio</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These are otherworldly things that are performing maneuvers that haven’t been seen.” — Congressman André Carson</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is the biggest disinformation campaign in the history of the U.S. government.” — Dan Farah</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary arrives at a time of significant change in how the U.S. government addresses UAPs. Bipartisan congressional hearings and the proposed UAP Disclosure Act indicate a growing demand for transparency in government dealings with unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Farah noted that interview subjects expressed concerns about the implications of UAP technology being reverse-engineered by adversarial nations. The focus of discussions has shifted from existential questions about life beyond Earth to immediate national security concerns.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the documentary's release, there may be increased public and governmental scrutiny regarding UAPs. Ongoing congressional discussions and potential legislative actions concerning UAP transparency are expected to develop further.</p>
