      <h2>Major Anomaly as Interstellar Object 3I/Atlas Measured to Be Over 33 Billion Tons</h2>

<p>A new study has found that interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is "anomalously massive," weighing around <strong>33 billion tons</strong> (33 trillion kilograms). The object was first spotted by astronomers on <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>, moving through the Solar System at nearly twice the speed of previous interstellar visitors, ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. Its nucleus, the rocky part of the comet, has an estimated diameter of <strong>5.6 kilometers</strong> (3.5 miles).</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the characteristics of interstellar objects. Researchers from Harvard University, including Richard Cloete, Avi Loeb, and Peter Vereš, have analyzed data from 227 observatories worldwide to understand the comet's properties. Their findings indicate that the object is far larger than previously detected interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated mass:</strong> 33 billion tons (33 trillion kilograms)</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus diameter:</strong> Approximately 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Non-gravitational acceleration:</strong> Below 15 meters per day squared</li>
    <li><strong>Mass loss rate:</strong> Around 150 kilograms (330 pounds) per second</li>
    <li><strong>Observation period:</strong> May 15 to September 23, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>, astronomers detected 3I/Atlas moving at high velocity through the Solar System. Between <strong>May 15 and September 23, 2025</strong>, data from 227 observatories was compiled to analyze the comet's trajectory. The research team compared the object's trajectory to expected gravitational acceleration, leading to the conclusion that the comet's nucleus is significantly massive.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is more massive than the other two interstellar objects, 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov by 3–5 orders of magnitude, constituting a major anomaly,” said Avi Loeb in a blog post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for Solar System small bodies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study highlights a puzzling trend in the discovery of interstellar objects. Despite the expectation that many more objects of this size should exist, only two prior interstellar objects have been detected. This raises questions about the distribution and characteristics of such bodies in the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers expect to gather more data on 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun, with potential observations using the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on <strong>October 3, 2025</strong>. However, the comet will be on the other side of the Sun during its closest approach and will reappear in December.</p>
