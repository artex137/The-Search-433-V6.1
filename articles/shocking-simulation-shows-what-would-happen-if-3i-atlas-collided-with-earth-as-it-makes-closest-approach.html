      <h2>Shocking simulation shows what would happen if 3I/ATLAS collided with Earth as it makes closest approach</h2>

<p>A simulation has demonstrated the catastrophic impact that comet 3I/ATLAS could have if it collided with Earth, as the interstellar object prepares for its closest approach on December 19, 2025. The comet, first identified by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, poses no actual threat, according to NASA officials, who stated that it will be approximately 270 million kilometers away from Earth during its closest approach.</p>

<p>This simulation has raised public interest in the comet's behavior and potential risks. While 3I/ATLAS is classified as a comet, Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has suggested it could be an unnatural object. NASA maintains that it is simply the third comet known to have originated from outside our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at around 1 a.m. EST.</li>
  <li>The comet will be approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth at that time.</li>
  <li>It was first identified by the ATLAS telescope in Chile during the summer of 2023.</li>
  <li>The simulation predicted a hypothetical impact could kill over 19 million people.</li>
  <li>The comet's estimated diameter ranges from 440 meters to 5,600 meters.</li>
  <li>If it collided with Earth, it could create a crater 27 kilometers wide and 792 meters deep.</li>
  <li>The comet travels at about 221,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile during the summer of 2023. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025. It is scheduled to approach Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 1 a.m. EST.</p>

<p>In a simulation conducted using the Neal Fun asteroid simulator, researchers entered details of a hypothetical crash scenario involving a 1,500 meter wide comet impacting at 100 kilometers a second. The simulation indicated significant destruction would occur if such an event were to happen.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“According to NASA, 3I/ATLAS poses absolutely no threat to us. At its nearest point, it will still be 270 million kilometers from Earth, making a collision impossible,” a NASA spokesperson stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third comet identified as originating from outside our solar system, following the discoveries of 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The public interest in 3I/ATLAS has surged due to its unusual characteristics and the speculation surrounding its origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS will continue its journey into deep space after its closest approach to Earth, and no further actions are planned regarding the comet. NASA will continue to monitor the object and provide updates as necessary.</p>
