      <h2>Two Comets Are Moving Into Your Night Skies in October: How to Watch</h2>

<p>Two comets, designated as Comet 3I ATLAS and Comet 3I A6-R2, are approaching Earth and will be visible in the night skies throughout October 2025. The exact visibility times and locations have not been disclosed.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers and skywatchers alike, as comets are rare celestial visitors. Various astronomical organizations, including the Canadian Space Agency, are preparing educational resources and viewing events to help the public observe these comets safely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS and Comet 3I A6-R2 will be visible in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Viewing times and specific locations have not been disclosed.</li>
    <li>The Canadian Space Agency is involved in public observation events.</li>
    <li>Comets are known for their bright tails and can be seen with the naked eye.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS was first discovered in 2023, followed by Comet 3I A6-R2 later that year. Since their discoveries, astronomers have tracked their trajectories, confirming their approach to Earth.</p>
<p>As October 2025 approaches, various astronomical societies have announced plans to host viewing events. These events aim to provide telescopes and expert guidance for the public.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These comets offer a unique opportunity for both amateur and professional astronomers to observe celestial phenomena,” said Dr. Emily Tran, an astronomer with the Canadian Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are infrequent visitors to the inner solar system, making their appearances noteworthy for both scientific study and public interest. The last significant comet visible from Earth was Comet NEOWISE in 2020.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comets approach, astronomers will continue to monitor their paths and provide updates. Public viewing events are scheduled throughout October, with exact dates and times to be announced soon.</p>
