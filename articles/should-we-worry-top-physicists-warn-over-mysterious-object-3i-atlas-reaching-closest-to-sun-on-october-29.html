      <h2>Should we worry: Top physicists warn over mysterious object 3I/ATLAS reaching closest to Sun on October 29</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, passing at approximately 1.36 astronomical units (AU), which is similar to the orbit of Mars. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>The significance of this event has drawn attention from astronomers and physicists due to the object's unusual behaviour. NASA and other space agencies are monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely, confirming that it poses no threat to Earth while remaining at a safe distance of about 270 million kilometres.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> 3I/ATLAS perihelion on October 29</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Approximately 1.36 AU from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Icy nucleus estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 km wide</li>
    <li><strong>Solar radiation:</strong> Up to 33 gigawatts expected at perihelion</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> About 270 million kilometres</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered earlier this year and has since exhibited behaviour that deviates from typical comet characteristics. Early observations indicated gas ejecting toward the Sun instead of away from it, raising questions among scientists.</p>

<p>By September, the object demonstrated a reversal of its tail direction, further complicating its classification. Spectral analysis revealed the presence of nickel tetracarbonyl, a compound not typically found in natural comets.</p>

<p>Leading up to its closest approach, NASA has activated Earth defence systems as a precaution, although no threat to Earth has been confirmed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If the object is an alien spacecraft slowing down, and the anti-tail is braking thrust, the transition from anti-tail to tail near perihelion would be expected,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Michio Kaku described 3I/ATLAS as “an intelligent visitor from another solar system. If it picks up energy after the flyby, that would be definitive proof.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have prompted discussions about the nature of interstellar objects and the potential for discovering extraterrestrial technology. Previous interstellar objects have not exhibited such striking behaviours, making 3I/ATLAS a subject of intense scrutiny.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, scientists will continue to observe its behaviour closely. They are particularly interested in any changes in speed or trajectory resulting from the solar radiation it will encounter.</p>
