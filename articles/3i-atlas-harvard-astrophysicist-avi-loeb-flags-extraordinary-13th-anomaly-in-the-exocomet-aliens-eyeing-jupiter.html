      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Astrophysicist Avi Loeb Flags Extraordinary 13th Anomaly In The Exocomet; Aliens Eyeing Jupiter?</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has identified an extraordinary thirteenth anomaly related to the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, which was discovered on <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>. Loeb’s findings suggest that the exocomet may exhibit non-comet-like behavior that indicates it could be a probe of extraterrestrial intelligence. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this discovery.</p>

<p>This matter has garnered attention from both the scientific community and the public. Experts and agencies, including <strong>NASA</strong>, have downplayed claims of alien origins despite ongoing speculation. Recent releases of images from NASA have not quelled public curiosity, as some believe they lack clarity and context.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Next Close Approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Analyzing Agency:</strong> NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</li>
    <li><strong>Number of Observatories Contributing Data:</strong> Approximately 230</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025. Since then, it has exhibited a series of twelve anomalies that have baffled scientists. In a recent blog, Loeb added a thirteenth anomaly, suggesting that the exocomet's trajectory may indicate it is a technological probe. He calculated the minimum distance of closest approach to Jupiter, based on data from NASA's JPL Horizons code.</p>

<p>Loeb noted that the non-gravitational acceleration of 3I/ATLAS during perihelion necessitated a small course correction, aligning its trajectory with Jupiter's gravitational influence, known as the Hill radius.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Let us suppose, hypothetically, that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a mothership that was designed to seed Jupiter with technological devices,” Loeb stated in his blog.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The distance of closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Jupiter is calculated by NASA’s JPL Horizons code based on orbital data gathered by about 230 observatories,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, Loeb studied other interstellar objects, including a meteor that revealed new materials not found in our solar system. This ongoing research has raised questions about the potential for extraterrestrial life and technology in our cosmic neighborhood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb anticipates that any new objects orbiting Jupiter after the passage of 3I/ATLAS could be identified by the <strong>Juno spacecraft</strong> or other orbiters. The implications of these findings may lead to further investigations into the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential connection to extraterrestrial civilizations.</p>
