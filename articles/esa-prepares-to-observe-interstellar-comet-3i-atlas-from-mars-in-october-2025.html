      <h2>ESA Prepares to Observe Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS from Mars in October 2025</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has announced plans to observe the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. The comet, which entered the solar system on July 1, 2025, will come within approximately 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) of Mars, significantly closer than its distance of 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) from Earth. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This observation presents a unique opportunity for astronomers to study the comet, officially designated as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS). ESA's project scientist for Mars orbiters, Colin Frank Wilson, confirmed that the agency is actively preparing to utilize existing spacecraft for the encounter. The data collected could provide vital insights into the composition and characteristics of this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS entered the solar system on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars is expected on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars during closest approach is approximately 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>ESA will use Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) for observations.</li>
    <li>NASA's MAVEN and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) may also participate in the observations.</li>
    <li>China's Tianwen-1 orbiter will contribute with its high-resolution camera.</li>
    <li>ESA's JUICE mission is set to observe 3I/ATLAS in July 2031.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS entered the solar system, marking a significant event for astronomers. As it approaches Mars, ESA has initiated preparations to observe the comet from its orbiters. The closest encounter with Mars is scheduled for October 3, 2025, during which ESA aims to capture images and analyze the comet’s spectral characteristics.</p>

<p>Initial observations of 3I/ATLAS have already been conducted by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which revealed unexpected results. ESA plans to leverage various spacecraft to gather data and insights during this unique celestial event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The close approach of 3I/ATLAS presents an unparalleled opportunity to study an interstellar object,” said Colin Frank Wilson, project scientist for ESA's Mars orbiters.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar visitors, such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable data about the characteristics of comets from outside the solar system. The upcoming observations of 3I/ATLAS may reveal further insights into the nature of these celestial bodies and their composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA and its partners will continue preparations for the October 3, 2025, observation, utilizing multiple spacecraft to capture data during the encounter. The scientific community is eagerly anticipating the findings from this historic event, which could enhance our understanding of interstellar comets.</p>
