      <h2>NASA allays fears interstellar enigma 3I/ATLAS is an alien ship</h2>

<p>Astronomers have been tracking comet 3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar visitor, since its discovery in May 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii. The object is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this discovery.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to reshape scientific understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. NASA officials have emphasized that there is no evidence suggesting the object is anything other than a comet. The agency is actively collecting data as the comet approaches the Sun on 30 October 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in May 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be more than five kilometers in diameter and weighs tens of billions of tons.</li>
    <li>It will pass closest to the Sun on 30 October 2025, inside the orbit of Mars.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth will be approximately 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA has stated all data supports that 3I/ATLAS is a comet.</li>
    <li>The James Webb Space Telescope has detected high levels of carbon dioxide in the comet's coma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2025, astronomers first identified 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS survey in Hawaii. Observations from over 200 telescopes have revealed its massive size, challenging existing models of interstellar debris. By October 2025, the comet will make its closest approach to the Sun, providing opportunities for further study.</p>

<p>In early October 2025, European Space Agency missions, including the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, plan to observe the comet from about 30 million kilometers away. Ground-based observatories and the James Webb telescope will continue monitoring its brightness and chemical composition as it approaches.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All of our data so far support the conclusion that 3I/ATLAS is a comet,” NASA officials stated in a recent briefing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Every interstellar object we’ve seen has been different,” said a representative from the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy. “That tells us there’s enormous diversity out there. We’ve only just begun to sample it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discoveries of 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which have contributed to the understanding of interstellar objects. The unexpected size and composition of 3I/ATLAS further complicate existing theories about how such objects can escape their home stars.</p>

<p>The unique chemical makeup of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its high carbon dioxide levels, contrasts with typical solar system comets, which usually release more water vapor. This suggests that 3I/ATLAS may have originated in a different environment than familiar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory out of the solar system, astronomers will gather as much data as possible before it fades from view in early 2026. The ongoing observations aim to deepen understanding of the diversity and composition of interstellar objects.</p>
