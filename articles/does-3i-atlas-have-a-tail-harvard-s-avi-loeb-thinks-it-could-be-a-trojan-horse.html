      <h2>Does 3I/ATLAS have a tail? Harvard’s Avi Loeb thinks it could be a Trojan horse</h2>

<p>The cosmic object 3I/ATLAS has sparked significant interest among scientists since its entry into our solar system. Astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University has raised concerns that 3I/ATLAS may not be a typical comet, suggesting it could be a "Trojan horse"—a spacecraft disguised as a natural phenomenon. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have led to increased scrutiny from NASA and the International Asteroid Warning Network.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges the understanding of interstellar objects and raises questions about potential extraterrestrial involvement. NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet, but its peculiar behavior has prompted monitoring efforts to track its trajectory and behavior more closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered by: ATLAS</li>
    <li>Estimated weight: 33 billion tonnes</li>
    <li>Unusual features: Jet of particles facing the Sun, "anti-tail" behavior</li>
    <li>Monitoring by: NASA and the International Asteroid Warning Network</li>
    <li>Next close approach: Not disclosed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has been a subject of debate among scientists regarding its nature. Avi Loeb has expressed concerns about the object's size and behavior, suggesting it may be a controlled spacecraft rather than a natural comet. NASA has begun monitoring the object, and the International Asteroid Warning Network has initiated a campaign to better understand its trajectory and behavior.</p>

<p>Loeb has noted that the object exhibits unusual emissions, including a plume of rare nickel, which raises speculation about its artificial origin. The object is expected to pass close to the Sun before leaving the solar system, although specific dates for this event have not been disclosed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, "3I/ATLAS is like a 'blind date,' where we expect everything to be friendly but must consider danger."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further remarked, "The object's unusual trajectory may be part of a reconnaissance mission."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The entry of large interstellar objects into the solar system is rare, and 3I/ATLAS marks the third such instance. Previous objects have not raised the same level of concern as 3I/ATLAS, making its study particularly important. The ongoing debate about the nature of these objects reflects broader questions about the potential for extraterrestrial life and technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network will continue its monitoring campaign to assess the impact of 3I/ATLAS on Earth. Further studies are expected to clarify the object's characteristics and trajectory as it approaches the Sun.</p>
