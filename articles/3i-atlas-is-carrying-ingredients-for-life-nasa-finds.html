      <h2>3I/ATLAS Is Carrying Ingredients for Life, NASA Finds</h2>

<p>NASA has detected significant amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide in the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, according to recent findings from the Goddard Space Flight Center. The readings were obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. This discovery marks the third time an interstellar object has been identified in our solar system.</p>

<p>The presence of methanol and hydrogen cyanide is significant because these molecules are essential for the formation of life as we know it. Scientists believe that the findings could indicate that 3I/ATLAS has a rocky core that contributes to the production of these gases. The research is detailed in a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper by astrochemist Martin Cordiner and his team.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Discovery date: Recent readings, specific date not disclosed</li>
    <li>Location of study: Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Chile</li>
    <li>Gases detected: Significant amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide</li>
    <li>Methanol concentration: Approximately 8% of total vapor from 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Comparison: Methanol levels are four times higher than those found in familiar solar system comets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA researchers have conducted studies of 3I/ATLAS using ALMA in Chile. The findings indicate that methanol and hydrogen cyanide are not only present but are abundant in this interstellar object. The concentrations observed are among the highest recorded in any comet.</p>

<p>As scientists continue to analyze the data, they are planning further observational campaigns targeting the comet around its perihelion, which is the point in its orbit where it is closest to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Molecules like hydrogen cyanide and methanol are at trace abundances and not the dominant constituents of our own comets,” said Martin Cordiner, highlighting the unusual nature of the findings in 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Observing campaigns targeting the comet near perihelion and as its angular distance from the Sun increases post-perihelion will doubtless provide further clues into the composition of this visitor from another star,” Cordiner added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of methanol and hydrogen cyanide in 3I/ATLAS supports theories that interstellar objects may have played a role in delivering essential ingredients for life to Earth billions of years ago. This aligns with ongoing research into the origins of life and the chemical processes that may occur in space.</p>

<p>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has suggested that the unique ratio of methanol to hydrogen cyanide production in 3I/ATLAS indicates a potentially “friendly” nature for this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. Further observations are planned to gain deeper insights into its composition and the implications for understanding the origins of life.</p>
