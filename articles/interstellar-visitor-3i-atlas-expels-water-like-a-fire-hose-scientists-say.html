      <h2>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS expels water like a fire hose, scientists say</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, has been expelling water at an extraordinary rate of nearly 40 kilograms per second while traveling through the solar system. NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected this activity between July and August 2025, surprising researchers with the volume of water loss at such a distance from the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery offers scientists a rare insight into the chemical makeup of distant planetary systems. The findings suggest that the ingredients necessary for life's chemistry may not be unique to Earth. Researchers are now studying the comet's behavior and planning further observations to better understand its composition and activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS releases nearly 40 kilograms of water per second.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted between July and August 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory made the initial detection.</li>
    <li>The comet is nearly three times farther from the sun than Earth.</li>
    <li>Data from Gemini South and NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility indicate ice fragments in the comet's coma act like geysers.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's Mars orbiters observed the comet in early October 2025.</li>
    <li>The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer is scheduled to track the comet in November 2025.</li>
    <li>Data from JUICE may not reach Earth until February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July and August 2025, NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected the ultraviolet fingerprint of hydroxyl from comet 3I/ATLAS. This observation revealed the comet's significant water loss, exceeding expectations for its distance from the sun.</p>

<p>In early October 2025, the European Space Agency's Mars orbiters captured additional observations of the comet. Looking ahead, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer is set to track the comet in November 2025, aiming to gather detailed data on its water release.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we detect water — or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH — from an interstellar comet, we're reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, a physics professor at Auburn University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, a postdoctoral researcher at Auburn University. “'Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn't expect it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery adds to a growing body of evidence that the building blocks necessary for life exist throughout the galaxy. Previous interstellar visitors, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have shown varied characteristics, challenging existing theories about the formation of comets and planets in different star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as more observations are made. The upcoming tracking by the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer in November 2025 will provide further insights into the comet's activity, with data expected to arrive on Earth by February 2026.</p>
