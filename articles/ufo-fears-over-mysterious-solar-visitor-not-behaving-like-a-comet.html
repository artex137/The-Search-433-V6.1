      <h2>UFO fears over mysterious solar visitor 'not behaving like a comet'</h2>

<p>The Pentagon has refused to release UFO files on 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object passing through the solar system, which some scientists speculate could be of alien origin. The 3.5-mile-wide cosmic visitor approached its closest point to the sun on October 29, but contrary to expectations, it did not display signs of breaking apart or produce a significant debris cloud.</p>

<p>This matter has garnered attention as authorities and scientists investigate the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has noted that recent images show the object remains intact, and its jets of material are unlike typical comet behavior. The Pentagon's refusal to provide classified information has raised questions among lawmakers and the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: 3.5 miles (approximately 5.6 km) wide</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Images taken: November 11, 2023</li>
    <li>Two jets of material reported: one 620,000 miles (approximately 1 million km) long towards the sun, and another 1.86 million miles (approximately 3 million km) away from the sun</li>
    <li>Investigating agencies: Pentagon, NASA</li>
    <li>Florida congresswoman involved: Anna Paulina Luna</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected as it entered the solar system, initially classified as an unusual comet. On October 29, 2023, it made its closest approach to the sun, where scientists expected it to break apart. However, observations revealed that the object maintained its structure.</p>
<p>On November 11, images from the Nordic Optical Telescope in Spain showed two jets of material emanating from 3I/ATLAS. This prompted further analysis and discussion among scientists, particularly regarding the object's unusual behavior.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna announced her lack of access to Pentagon files on 3I/ATLAS, raising further questions about governmental transparency regarding UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Technological thrusters which point their exhaust towards the sun would accelerate away from the sun. This post-perihelion maneuver might be employed by a spacecraft that aims to gain speed rather than slow down through the gravitational assist from the sun.” - Professor Avi Loeb</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I do believe it's a passing through comet, and so I don't think we are going to have any contact with any non-human intelligence yet, but the ruling is still out there on what this is.” - Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Astronomers have categorised this object as interstellar because of the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path. It does not follow a closed orbital path about the Sun.” - NASA</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The investigation into 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader interest in unidentified aerial phenomena and potential extraterrestrial encounters. Previous incidents involving unidentified objects have led to increased scrutiny from both the scientific community and government bodies.</p>
<p>NASA and other agencies have been actively studying interstellar objects, with 3I/ATLAS presenting unique challenges due to its unexpected behavior and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as its orbit and physical properties are examined. Further investigations by NASA and other agencies are expected, while Congresswoman Luna is likely to pursue access to the classified information withheld by the Pentagon.</p>
