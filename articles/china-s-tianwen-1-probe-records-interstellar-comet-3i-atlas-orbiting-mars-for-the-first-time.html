      <h2>China’s Tianwen-1 probe records interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS orbiting Mars for the first time</h2>

<p>The Chinese probe Tianwen-1 has captured unprecedented images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed approximately 29 million kilometers from Mars in October. This achievement marks a significant milestone in monitoring celestial bodies from the orbit of the red planet, according to the Escritório Nacional of Ciência Espacial of China.</p>

<p>The successful imaging of comet 3I/ATLAS provides crucial data for international analyses regarding the composition and behavior of this unique interstellar visitor. The comet, recognized as the third confirmed object originating from outside the Solar System, was first detected on July 1 using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The data gathered enhances understanding of the comet's structure and trajectory, which moves at an impressive speed of 58 kilometers per second.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed 29 million kilometers from Mars in October 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet moves at a speed of 58 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Images captured by the Tianwen-1 probe reveal a rocky nucleus with a diameter of 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma extends for thousands of kilometers and exhibits active ice evaporation.</li>
    <li>ESA and NASA contributed additional data from their respective probes for comprehensive analysis.</li>
    <li>Observation planning began in September 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Planning for its observation began in September 2023, involving complex orbit simulations. The Tianwen-1 probe successfully captured images of the comet in October 2023 as it passed near Mars.</p>
<p>Following the imaging, data processing was conducted in Beijing to analyze the comet's structure, including its rocky nucleus and gaseous coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detailed images provided by the Tianwen-1 probe reveal significant insights into the comet's structure and composition,” said a representative from the Escritório Nacional of Ciência Espacial of China.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our Solar System. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirms it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. The study of such comets is vital for understanding the formation of cold protoplanetary disks and the processes of planetary formation that date back to older eras.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analyses of the data collected from Tianwen-1, along with contributions from ESA and NASA, will continue to refine models of the comet's trajectory and its interaction with solar radiation. The ongoing collaboration among space agencies aims to enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>
