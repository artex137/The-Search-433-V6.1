      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Spewing Water Like a Cosmic Fire Hydrant</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed releasing water at a rate of about 40 kilograms per second, according to researchers using the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The comet, located more than three times the distance from the sun as Earth, exhibits unusual characteristics for a celestial body of its type.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it allows scientists to study the comet using the same methods applied to regular comets, potentially offering insights into the processes of comets from other star systems. The findings indicate that the ingredients for life’s chemistry may not be unique to Earth, according to Dennis Bodewits, a physicist from Auburn University.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is releasing water at a rate of 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>It is located more than three times farther from the sun than Earth.</li>
    <li>The data was collected using the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</li>
    <li>Research conducted by scientists from Auburn University.</li>
    <li>OH production was detected at a distance where sublimation is typically not expected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers have tracked the activity of comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. The detection of water and hydroxyl compounds occurred during observations made by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, which is equipped to capture ultraviolet signatures without atmospheric interference.</p>
<p>The comet's behavior was notable as it began leaking water at a significant rate while still far from the sun, challenging previous understandings of comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we detect water—or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH—from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, an Auburn University physicist who collaborated on the research.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” stated Zexi Xing, an Auburn University researcher and coauthor of the discovery.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are typically composed of frozen rock, gases, and dust, and they usually orbit stars. Most comets in the solar system release water when they approach the sun and heat up, but 3I/ATLAS is behaving differently. Previous interstellar comets, such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, exhibited unique characteristics that have reshaped scientists' understanding of comet formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further studies will focus on the structure and behavior of 3I/ATLAS to gather more insights into its origins and the processes that govern interstellar comets. Researchers aim to analyze the data collected to enhance the understanding of comets from other star systems.</p>
