      <h2>Mystery Of Strange 'UFOs' Seen Flying Over New Jersey Has Been Solved</h2>

<p>A private aerial contractor has taken responsibility for the drone sightings that caused panic over New Jersey in November 2024. The company revealed its involvement during a panel at the Army’s UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker, Alabama, in August 2025, according to an attendee who spoke with The New York Post.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it clarifies the source of the mysterious sightings that had prompted concerns among residents and sparked various theories about unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Authorities had previously suggested that the drones might be operated by hobbyists or recreational pilots, but the contractor's admission has provided a definitive explanation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>Incident date: November 13, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Picatinny Arsenal Army base, Morris County, New Jersey</li>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
