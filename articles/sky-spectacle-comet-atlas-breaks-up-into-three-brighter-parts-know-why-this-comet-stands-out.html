      <h2>Comet ATLAS Breaks Up into Fragments in Dramatic Celestial Display</h2>

<p>Comet ATLAS (C/2025 K1) has been observed breaking up into at least three brighter fragments, with sightings reported starting November 12. The celestial event has captivated astronomers and skywatchers alike, as the comet travels through the Ursa Major constellation.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant due to the comet's unique golden hue, which sets it apart from others that typically appear green or blue. Authorities and astronomers are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and brightness, as it has become easily visible using standard telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet ATLAS (C/2025 K1) discovered on May 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Breakup observed starting November 12, 2023</li>
    <li>Current brightness at magnitude 10</li>
    <li>Travelling through Ursa Major constellation since November 24, 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, at approximately 270 million km</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 24, 2025, Comet ATLAS (C/2025 K1) was discovered. Starting November 12, 2023, astronomer Michael Jager reported the comet's dramatic breakup into at least three luminescent parts. By November 24, the comet had been traveling through the Ursa Major constellation, showcasing its distinctive golden hue.</p>

<p>Images of the comet's fragmentation were captured by Italian astronomer Gianluca Masi using a robotic unit from the Virtual Telescope Project. The comet's brightness and unique characteristics have drawn significant attention from the astronomical community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The golden hue of Comet ATLAS (C/2025 K1) suggests it is probably lacking in carbon-bearing molecules,” said Dr. David Schleicher from Lowell Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual colour of Comet ATLAS (C/2025 K1) is attributed to its composition, setting it apart from typical comets. This event follows the earlier detection of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has been recognized for its hyperbolic path and is believed to be older than the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers expect to capture more images and data, particularly as it approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023. Observations will continue, especially as it moves past Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.</p>
