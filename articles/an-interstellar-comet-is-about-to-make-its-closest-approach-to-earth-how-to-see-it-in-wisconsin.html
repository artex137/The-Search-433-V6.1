      <h2>Wisconsinites Prepare for Viewing of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>Wisconsinites will have the opportunity to see Comet 3I/ATLAS as it makes its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet was first observed in our solar system in early July 2025 and has since traveled through the inner solar system.</p>

<p>NASA has reported that the comet passed just inside the orbit of Mars by late October, reaching its closest point to the sun at a distance of approximately <strong>209 million kilometers</strong>. This event marks a significant moment for astronomers and skywatchers as it provides a rare chance to observe an interstellar comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Observation:</strong> Early July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Point to Sun:</strong> Approximately 209 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Visible in Wisconsin</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Scientists first detected Comet 3I/ATLAS in early July 2025. By late October, the comet had moved just inside Mars' orbit, indicating its approach toward the sun. It is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a unique opportunity for the public to see an interstellar comet,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of interstellar comets is rare, with Comet 3I/ATLAS being a significant addition to the catalog of known comets. Its trajectory and composition provide valuable data for ongoing research in astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers in Wisconsin should prepare for the viewing on December 19, 2025, as astronomers continue to study the comet's path and characteristics leading up to its closest approach.</p>
