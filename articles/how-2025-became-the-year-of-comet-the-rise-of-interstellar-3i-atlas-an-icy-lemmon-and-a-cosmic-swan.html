      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Captivates Stargazers in 2025</h2>

<p>In 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS has emerged as a significant astronomical event, captivating observers worldwide since its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. This interstellar comet is one of three notable comets observed this year, alongside C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) and C/2025 R2 (SWAN).</p>

<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS stems from its status as only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its potential size and brightness have drawn attention from scientists and the public alike, while also attracting conspiracy theories regarding its origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Diameter: Up to 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers)</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest approach to the sun): October 30, 2025, at a distance of 125 million miles (202 million km)</li>
    <li>Visibility: Became visible to Earthbound astronomers in early November 2025</li>
    <li>NASA press conference: November 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS telescope. Follow-up observations confirmed its interstellar origin and size. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, passing 125 million miles from the sun. Observations from spacecraft orbiting Mars monitored its activity during this time. After emerging from behind the sun's glare in early November, 3I/ATLAS became visible to astronomers and the public.</p>

<p>On November 11, 2025, comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) broke into three pieces following its close approach to the sun on October 8. This event highlighted the fragility of comets during their solar encounters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya during a press conference on November 19, addressing conspiracy theories regarding the comet's nature.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed in recent years. Its appearance has reignited interest in the scientific study of comets and their behavior as they approach the sun. The ongoing observations of these celestial bodies contribute to our understanding of the solar system's formation and evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As astronomers continue to study 3I/ATLAS, further observations will focus on its chemical composition and behavior as it travels back into space. The scientific community anticipates more discoveries from this and other comets in the coming months.</p>
