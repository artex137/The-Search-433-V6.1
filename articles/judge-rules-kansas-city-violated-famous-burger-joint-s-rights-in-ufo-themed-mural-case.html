      <h2>Judge rules Kansas city violated famous burger joint’s rights in UFO-themed mural case</h2>

<p>The City of Salina has unconstitutionally restricted the free speech of Cozy Inn, a century-old hamburger restaurant, by designating its UFO-themed mural as a regulated sign instead of an unregulated artwork, according to a ruling by U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse. The ruling was issued on November 21, 2025, and has been celebrated by free speech advocates and the Kansas Justice Institute (KJI), which represented the restaurant's owner, Steve Howard.</p>

<p>This ruling is significant as it highlights the ongoing debate over free speech and artistic expression in municipal regulations. The case underscores concerns regarding government overreach and the potential for arbitrary enforcement of city codes. The KJI aims to challenge laws that infringe on free speech rights, furthering their litigation campaign against city regulations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Judge:</strong> Toby Crouse</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Salina, Kansas</li>
    <li><strong>Business:</strong> Cozy Inn, established in 1922</li>
    <li><strong>Ruling date:</strong> November 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Legal representation:</strong> Kansas Justice Institute (KJI)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The conflict began two years ago when the City of Salina determined that the UFOs in the mural resembled hamburgers, categorizing it as a sign subject to city code. Cozy Inn’s owner, Steve Howard, commissioned the mural to contribute to Salina's growing art scene.</p>
<p>Following the city’s ruling, Howard's permit application for the mural was placed on indefinite hold, prompting legal action from KJI on behalf of Howard and the Cozy Inn.</p>
<p>On November 21, 2025, Judge Crouse issued his ruling, finding that Salina's distinction between murals and signs was unconstitutional and that the city had imposed an unlawful prior restraint on the restaurant's speech.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Salina’s code would have allowed Steve to paint a mural depicting flying pizza slices, but not ‘burger-esque’ UFOs, just because The Cozy sells sliders. That’s not just unfair, it’s unconstitutional,” said Samuel MacRoberts, KJI’s Litigation Director.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The ruling is clear, to the point, and correct. Salina’s officials don’t get to play art critic, picking and choosing which murals stay, and which go,” MacRoberts added. “The right to free speech doesn’t work that way and never has.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This case reflects broader issues of free speech in the context of municipal regulations on art and signage. The KJI has been actively challenging laws that interfere with rights to free expression, and this ruling adds another precedent in the ongoing discourse about government authority over artistic content.</p>
<p>Prior incidents in various jurisdictions have similarly raised concerns about the balance between community standards and individual rights, particularly regarding artistic expressions that local governments may find contentious.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Kansas Justice Institute plans to continue its efforts to challenge municipal regulations that it views as unconstitutional. The ruling may prompt Salina officials to reconsider their regulations regarding murals and signs in order to align with the First Amendment protections established by the court.</p>
