      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches the Sun, Sparks Interest Among Astronomers</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023, exciting astronomers worldwide. This rare interstellar comet is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, having travelled billions of miles through other systems in space. Its trajectory is hyperbolic, allowing it to escape the sun's gravitational pull.</p>

<p>The significance of Comet 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to provide insights into the formation of other star systems. Authorities, including NASA, are closely monitoring its path and characteristics, as this comet presents a unique opportunity for scientific study. "Interstellar objects are like cosmic time capsules," according to Space.com, which could help scientists compare materials from various exoplanetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>It is travelling at approximately 130,000 miles per hour, the highest velocity recorded for a solar system visitor.</li>
    <li>The comet will be closest to the sun at about 130 million miles on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>It is expected to come closest to Earth around December 19, 2023, at a distance of roughly 167 million miles.</li>
    <li>The comet is not currently visible to the naked eye or telescopes, but visibility is expected to improve in mid-to-late November.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 during a sky survey. After its discovery, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope provided critical data about its size and composition. The comet has been accelerating as it nears the sun and will soon exit the solar system.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2023, it reached its closest point to the sun at approximately 130 million miles. Predictions indicate it will come closest to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "No one knows where the comet came from. It’s like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second." 
    <footer>- David Jewitt, University of California</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "It looks like a comet. It does comet things. The evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body." 
    <footer>- Tom Statler, NASA lead scientist</footer>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the earlier discoveries of 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, which were the first two confirmed interstellar objects. These discoveries have opened new avenues in astrophysics, allowing researchers to explore materials and conditions from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University, has suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be "hostile" alien technology, a claim met with skepticism by many in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves further from the sun. The comet's visibility is expected to improve in December, allowing astronomers to gather more data before it exits the solar system.</p>
