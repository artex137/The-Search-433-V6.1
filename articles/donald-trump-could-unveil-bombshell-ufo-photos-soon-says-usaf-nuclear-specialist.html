      <h2>Donald Trump 'could unveil bombshell UFO photos soon' says USAF nuclear specialist</h2>

<p>An ex-Air Force nuclear specialist has suggested that former President Donald Trump might become the UAP "disclosure" president, potentially revealing "photos of a recovered craft" this year. Gene Sticco made these comments in light of recent heightened public interest in UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomena), which has been fueled by various reports and testimonies related to unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>This discussion matters as it touches on an ongoing debate regarding the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence and the government's transparency on the subject. Sticco indicated that a presidential commission could be formed to facilitate disclosure, with significant implications for public understanding and governmental accountability.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Gene Sticco is a national security expert and former Air Force nuclear protection specialist.</li>
    <li>Sticco's father-in-law, Valerij Černohajev, reportedly authored a manuscript on UAP.</li>
    <li>The documentary "The Age of Disclosure" features 34 senior figures from the US government and military.</li>
    <li>Sticco anticipates a presidential commission could be expected in 2026.</li>
    <li>He believes the public may see "photos of a recovered craft" as part of the disclosure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, UAP has gained significant public attention due to various reports and claims, including encounters reported by US Navy pilots and whistleblower testimonies. A documentary titled "The Age of Disclosure" has contributed to the discourse by showcasing insights from government and military officials.</p>

<p>Gene Sticco, involved in the UAP discussion, has indicated that the US government may possess evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence. He suggests that a formal process for disclosure could unfold under Trump's leadership, potentially leading to the release of significant information by 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The 'smoking gun' is out there. Whether or not they EVER wheel it out for public display is another question." 
    <strong>— Gene Sticco</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "I do think President Trump will be the 'disclosure' President. The next step I expect is a Presidential Commission which will set the stage for the disclosure speech."
    <strong>— Gene Sticco</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "So even if it's not full disclosure, the basic confirmations get out, the debate is settled and institutions can begin taking steps towards normalization of this 'new reality.'"
    <strong>— Gene Sticco</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The UAP phenomenon has been a topic of interest for decades, with numerous reports of sightings and encounters. Recent developments have led to increased scrutiny of government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena, with the public demanding more information. The documentary "The Age of Disclosure" has further fueled discussions about a potential cover-up related to non-human intelligent life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP and its implications for national security are expected to continue. A potential presidential commission may be established to evaluate the evidence and recommend actions to Congress regarding transparency and disclosure policies. The timeline for any significant announcements remains uncertain, but Sticco suggests that developments could occur as early as 2026.</p>
