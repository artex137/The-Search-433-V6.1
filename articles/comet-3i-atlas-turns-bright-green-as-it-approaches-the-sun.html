      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Turns Bright Green as It Approaches the Sun</h2>

<p>Recent observations of comet 3I/ATLAS have revealed a striking emerald hue as it approaches the sun, with astrophotographers capturing images over Namibia during the total lunar eclipse on September 7. The comet, which is not a native of our solar system, was discovered in early July and is moving at a speed of over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it suggests a transformation of the comet due to increased solar radiation. Authorities and astronomers are closely monitoring its trajectory and color changes as it heads toward a flyby of Mars next month and its closest encounter with the sun on October 29.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>Current speed: over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Diameter: approximately 7 miles (11 kilometers).</li>
    <li>Closest encounter with the sun: October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Upcoming flyby of Mars: October 2023.</li>
    <li>Color observation made during total lunar eclipse on September 7, 2023.</li>
    <li>Expected reemergence before closest point to Earth in December 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023. On September 7, during a total lunar eclipse, astrophotographers captured images of the comet in Namibia, revealing its possible green coloration. As the comet approaches the sun, it is absorbing more solar energy, which contributes to its transformation.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to fly by Mars next month and reach its closest point to the sun on October 29. It will reemerge months later before its closest point to Earth in December 2023, remaining approximately 700 times farther away than the moon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It is still too early to confirm the green light observed from the comet, as additional data and sightings from other astronomers are needed,” experts noted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Avi Loeb, an astronomer from Harvard University, stated, “The green coloration could stem from cyanide, which was detected in its coma in late August by the Very Large Telescope in Chile.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first instance of green comets. Historical examples include comets C/2022 E3, 12P/Pons-Brooks, and SWAN25F, which displayed similar colors due to the presence of dicarbon, a molecule made up of two bonded carbon atoms. Spectroscopic studies of 3I/ATLAS have yet to detect dicarbon in its coma, suggesting it might be hidden beneath layers of recently melted ice.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>More observations will be essential in the coming weeks to clarify the cause of the color transformation of comet 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey toward the sun.</p>
