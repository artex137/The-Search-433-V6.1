      <h2>Congressman Burlison discusses skepticism about extraterrestrial life and UFOs</h2>

<p>Congressman Eric Burlison has expressed skepticism about the existence of extraterrestrial life during an interview with Newstalk KZRG, emphasizing the need for caution regarding UFO disclosures. The discussion took place recently, with Burlison addressing the complexities of unidentified aerial phenomena and government responses to them.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights ongoing debates within government circles about UFOs and the potential implications for national security. Burlison has served on the Oversight Committee investigating this topic for two and a half years and believes that government agencies face challenges in explaining these phenomena due to technological limitations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Congressman Burlison articulated his views on UFOs and extraterrestrial life. He shared his experiences on the Oversight Committee, where he has investigated UFO-related topics for the past two and a half years. Burlison reiterated his skepticism about the existence of beings from other planets, aligning his perspective with that of former President Obama.</p>

<p>Burlison noted that government agencies face challenges in providing explanations for unidentified objects, attributing this partly to a desire to keep U.S. technological limitations concealed from adversaries.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You know, I've been on the Oversight committee investigating this topic for the last two and a half years. I still remain skeptical on this topic. I don't believe that there's necessarily little green men from another planet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I actually kind of have the view that President Barack Obama had when he was interviewed. He said, do they exist? Basically he was probably saying, I haven't seen them and they're not in any underground bases that I'm aware of. That's the same position I'm in.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’m a Christian, so I certainly believe that there are beings that exist that are not terrestrial beings, not of this Earth.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
