      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Spotting From Earth: Is The Interstellar Object Visible From Home Planet? Here's How You Can See It</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has returned to visibility from Earth after passing its closest approach to the Sun on October 30. The comet, first detected on July 1, is currently on its way back to the night sky and can be spotted with basic viewing equipment. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to its observation.</p>

<p>The visibility of 3I/ATLAS is significant for space enthusiasts and astronomers alike. Experts have noted that the comet offers an opportunity to study interstellar objects and their formation processes. Observers can expect the best viewing chances from early November through December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>Best visibility is expected from early November 2023 to December 2025.</li>
    <li>Observers should look to the low eastern horizon before dawn.</li>
    <li>Visibility requires at least a medium telescope; it is not visible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered in our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023, and reached perihelion on October 30, 2023. Following this closest approach to the Sun, the comet is now returning to the night sky, becoming visible to observers on Earth.</p>

<p>Experts have indicated that the comet can be seen with basic telescopes, contrary to earlier claims that it was no longer visible. Astronomer Yicheng Zhang has emphasized that the visibility issues stemmed from the limitations of larger telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is easily visible with small telescopes now,” said astronomer Yicheng Zhang. “A lot of large telescopes...can’t observe objects particularly close to the Sun in twilight,” he explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects studied within our solar system. Astronomers aim to learn more about the formation of comets in different regions of the galaxy by analyzing this comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey back into view, astronomers will monitor its trajectory and visibility. Observers are encouraged to prepare their equipment for the upcoming viewing opportunities in the coming months and years.</p>
