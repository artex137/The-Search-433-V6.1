      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Comet or Alien Spaceship? 7 Anomalies Fuel Extraterrestrial Debate</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, first detected on 1 July 2025 in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile, has prompted intense discussions among astronomers regarding its origin and nature. This object, which is the third confirmed visitor from beyond our solar system, exhibits several anomalies that challenge conventional comet models.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as NASA and ESA missions track 3I/ATLAS's hyperbolic path towards its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025. The debate centers on whether the object is a natural icy comet or an engineered spacecraft potentially probing Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Velocity at perihelion: approximately 244,000 km/h (152,000 mph).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: 1.36 AU on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Observed passing 30 million km from Mars by ESA's Mars Express.</li>
    <li>Nucleus estimated to be 1.4 to 5.6 km in size, weighing 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Unique composition includes a 7.6:1 CO2-to-water ratio.</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration measured below 4.6 m per day.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS in R&iacute;o Hurtado, Chile. This detection confirmed its extrasolar origin through its hyperbolic orbit. On 21 July 2025, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope imaged the object at a distance of 277 million miles from Earth. By 6 August 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope reported a significant CO2-to-water ratio. In September 2025, the Very Large Telescope noted unusual nickel dominance over iron in the object's composition.</p>
<p>On 4 October 2025, NASA's Perseverance rover captured a cylindrical streak near Mars, which was later dismissed as an artefact. Discussions regarding the object's potential artificial origin intensified following Avi Loeb's proposal in September 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The scale and precision of 3I/ATLAS suggest 'alien origin',” said Avi Loeb in a NewsNation interview. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “NASA reassures there is no collision risk, focusing on scientific gains from this interstellar object,” an agency spokesperson stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS follows the previous interstellar objects 'Oumuamua and Borisov, which have also sparked debates regarding their origins. The unique trajectory and composition of 3I/ATLAS have led to comparisons with these earlier findings, prompting calls for further investigation into its nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth in December 2025, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition. Further observations and analyses are expected to help clarify the object's origins and whether it may represent an engineered design.</p>
