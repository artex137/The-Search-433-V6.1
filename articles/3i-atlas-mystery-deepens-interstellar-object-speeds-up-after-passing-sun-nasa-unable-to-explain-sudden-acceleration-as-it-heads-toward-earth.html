      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery Deepens as NASA Reports Unexplained Acceleration</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, has exhibited an unexplained increase in speed after passing close to the Sun on October 29, according to NASA. The object has drawn global attention due to its unusual behavior as it moves away from the Sun, raising questions about its nature and the forces acting upon it.</p>

<p>This acceleration, which cannot be accounted for by solar gravity alone, has prompted scientists to investigate further. NASA confirmed that the object’s trajectory deviates from predictions, leading to speculation about its composition and the possibility of unexpected influences. The object is expected to reach its closest point to Earth in six weeks.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Initial speed:</strong> Over 130,000 mph upon entering the Solar System</li>
    <li><strong>Speed after perihelion:</strong> Approximately 152,000 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Date of perihelion:</strong> October 29</li>
    <li><strong>Projected closest approach to Earth:</strong> Six weeks from now</li>
    <li><strong>Mass loss requirement for observed behavior:</strong> At least 13%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System traveling at over 130,000 mph. After its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, astronomers noted a further increase in speed to approximately 152,000 mph. NASA has confirmed that this acceleration cannot solely be attributed to the Sun’s gravitational pull.</p>
<p>As the object continues its trajectory away from the Sun, scientists are seeking to understand the forces influencing its motion. The James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to conduct observations in December to search for any residual gas or material.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard physicist, stated, "Astronomers have not detected evidence of the gas emissions expected from a standard comet." He suggested that if 3I/ATLAS continues to show no surrounding gas cloud, the explanation might lie outside natural processes.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is among the fastest interstellar objects detected to date. Under typical conditions, comets display gas emissions when nearing the Sun, which can alter their speed and direction. The lack of such emissions from 3I/ATLAS raises questions about its classification and the underlying physics at play.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope's observations in December are expected to provide further insights into the object’s behavior and composition.</p>
