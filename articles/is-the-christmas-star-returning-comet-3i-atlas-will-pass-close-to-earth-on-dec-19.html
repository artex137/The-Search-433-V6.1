      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS to Pass Close to Earth on December 19</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023, according to astronomers. The comet, known for its bright appearance, is expected to be visible in the night sky during this event.</p>

<p>The approach of Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant for astronomers and stargazers alike. Observers anticipate a spectacular view, as the comet will pass within approximately 0.09 astronomical units (13.5 million kilometres) of Earth. Astronomical societies are planning events to educate the public about the comet and its features.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
