      <h2>NASA scientists stunned by mysterious interstellar object nearing Earth</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is approaching Earth and has left NASA scientists astonished as it draws closer. Current scans reveal that the comet is significantly smaller than previously thought, measuring approximately 1.7 miles in diameter and releasing around 904 trillion molecules of carbon dioxide gas each second. At present, 3I/ATLAS is about 298 million miles from Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge of comet behavior and composition. Authorities are actively monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics using NASA's most powerful telescopes. The unusual properties of 3I/ATLAS may provide new insights into the origins of comets and celestial objects from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 1.7 miles in diameter.</li>
    <li>It is releasing about 904 trillion molecules of CO2 each second.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently 298 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at nearly 150,000 mph.</li>
    <li>It is expected to pass within 223 miles of Earth by December 17.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected from outside the Milky Way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023 by the ATLAS telescope network, which is tasked with detecting potentially hazardous objects. The comet's presence was further confirmed when photos were inadvertently captured by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile. Initial observations suggested the comet was 12 miles in diameter, but later scans revealed its actual size to be much smaller.</p>
<p>In mid-August 2023, scientists proposed that the comet might consist of a mixture of CO2 and ice, with the CO2 preventing the ice from melting into vapor. This finding has raised questions about the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, as it lacks the typical tail or jets of gas and dust associated with most comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet is unlike any we have seen before,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist. “Its unusual properties may suggest it has origins outside our understanding of comet formation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects. Previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have sparked interest and debate among scientists concerning their origins and compositions. The study of such comets helps refine our understanding of the solar system's formation and the dynamics of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Scientists will analyze its characteristics to better understand its composition and trajectory. Further observations are expected as the comet nears its closest point to Earth.</p>
