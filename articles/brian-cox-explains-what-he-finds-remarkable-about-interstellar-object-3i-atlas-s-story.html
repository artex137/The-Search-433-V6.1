      <h2>Brian Cox Highlights Significance of Comet 3I/ATLAS Discovery</h2>
<p>Renowned physicist Brian Cox has shared insights about comet 3I/ATLAS, emphasizing its importance for humanity's relationship with celestial bodies. His comments come following the comet's discovery by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System on July 1, 2025, and highlight its status as the fastest recorded object of its kind.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks humanity's third verified encounter with an interstellar object. Authorities, including the European Space Agency, have coordinated efforts to capture imagery of the comet using multiple spacecraft positioned near Mars and Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It has an eccentricity rating between 6.1 and 6.2.</li>
    <li>Estimated to have formed approximately 7.5 billion years ago.</li>
    <li>Multiple space agencies involved, including the European Space Agency and NASA.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors include ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Initial observations indicated its exceptional speed and trajectory, confirming its classification as an interstellar object. The European Space Agency deployed its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter to photograph the comet. Meanwhile, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft prepared to document the comet's passage near Jupiter.</p>
<p>NASA also attempted to capture images of 3I/ATLAS using the Perseverance rover on Mars, although confirmation of those images is still pending.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What makes this achievement particularly striking is the temporal context... Today, humanity routinely operates sophisticated instruments on distant worlds,”</blockquote> said Brian Cox, reflecting on the advancements in space exploration. 

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previously, interstellar visitors like ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov generated significant interest within the scientific community. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS benefits from enhanced preparedness and a distributed observation network across the solar system, demonstrating progress in scientific collaboration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations continue, scientists will analyze data from 3I/ATLAS to better understand its composition and trajectory. The ongoing collaboration among international space agencies will facilitate further observation and research opportunities related to this interstellar object.</p>
