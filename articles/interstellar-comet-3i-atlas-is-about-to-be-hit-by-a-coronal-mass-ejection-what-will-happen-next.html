      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas to Face Coronal Mass Ejection</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is set to collide with a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun on September 25, 2025, according to NASA. The comet, first spotted on July 1, 2025, is moving through the Solar System at nearly twice the speed of previous interstellar visitors and is expected to come within 0.35854 astronomical units of Jupiter.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks only the third known interstellar object to enter the Solar System. Astronomers are monitoring the situation closely, as the CME's impact could provide valuable insights into the comet's characteristics and behaviour. The Sun is currently more active than expected, complicating observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has an estimated nucleus size of 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles).</li>
    <li>Its mass is believed to exceed 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>The CME is predicted to collide with the comet on September 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will approach Jupiter at a distance of about 0.35854 AU.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers identified 3I/Atlas, an interstellar comet, moving rapidly through the Solar System. As it approached the Sun, it displayed characteristics typical of comets, including outgassing. NASA has been tracking its trajectory closely.</p>

<p>A forecast by NASA indicated that a CME would impact 3I/Atlas on September 25, 2025. This prediction comes amid heightened solar activity, which has been described as the Sun "slowly waking up" during this stage of the Solar Cycle.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"It's not often we get an interstellar visitor, this being only the third that we know of," NASA stated. "While we haven't seen an interstellar comet being struck by a CME before, we have seen it happen to others." </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous instances of comets being affected by CMEs include an event on April 20, 2007, when Comet Encke experienced a CME impact. The CME caused a temporary disruption in the comet's tail, but it quickly reformed. Astronomers do not expect a significant change in 3I/Atlas's trajectory due to its large mass, but the effects on its tail remain of interest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/Atlas closely until it enters solar conjunction, a phase during which the Sun will obstruct Earth’s view of the comet. The short window for observations makes the upcoming CME event particularly significant for researchers.</p>
