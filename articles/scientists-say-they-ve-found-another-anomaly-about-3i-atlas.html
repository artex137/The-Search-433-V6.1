      <h2>Scientists Say They’ve Found Another Anomaly About 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported a new anomaly concerning the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, expected to make its closest approach on October 29, 2023. The comet will come within approximately 126 million miles of the Sun, which is just shy of twice the average distance between Earth and the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as astronomers prepare to observe 3I/ATLAS with ground- and space-based telescopes during this rare opportunity. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, has highlighted various anomalies associated with the object, including its trajectory and composition. He continues to monitor the comet closely, noting the potential implications of their findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach date:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun at perihelion:</strong> 126 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Observation period:</strong> Early July to September 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Research published in:</strong> Astronomy & Astrophysics</li>
    <li><strong>Research conducted by:</strong> Astronomers in Spain</li>
    <li><strong>Probability of specific alignment:</strong> 0.5 percent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation since early July 2023. During this time, a team of astronomers from Spain detected a wobbling high-altitude jet in the comet, which was reported in a recent letter published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.</p>
<p>The comet reached its perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, on October 29, 2023. During this period, it exhibited an unusual "anti-tail" jet that has raised questions about its composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "If not for that special alignment, the anti-tail jet towards the Sun would have been oriented at a much larger angle relative to the rotation axis."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb further explained, "With a larger misalignment angle, it could have featured prominent gaps in activity as its base exits the dayside and enters the nightside of 3I/ATLAS."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar objects to pass through the solar system, making its study critical for understanding such celestial bodies. Previous observations have indicated various anomalies, including its unusually large suspected size and high concentration of carbon dioxide ice and gas.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to conduct spectroscopic observations of the material inside 3I/ATLAS’ anti-tail to gain further insights into its composition and behaviour. These upcoming studies may clarify the object's unique features and alignments.</p>
