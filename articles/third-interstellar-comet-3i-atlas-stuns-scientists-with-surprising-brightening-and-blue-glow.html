      <h2>Third Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Stuns Scientists With Surprising Brightening and Blue Glow</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has surprised astronomers with unexpected brightening and a blue hue since its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Río Hurtado, Chile. The comet is only the third known interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, and poses no threat to Earth as it will not come closer than 240–270 million km.</p>

<p>This unexpected behavior of 3I/ATLAS has significant implications for the study of interstellar objects. NASA and various observatories are closely monitoring the comet's activity as it approaches perihelion, which occurred on October 29, 2025. Scientists are eager to analyze its composition and learn about the conditions of its home system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> 240–270 million km (1.6–1.8 AU)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated age:</strong> 7–9 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Speed upon entry:</strong> Over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025. It entered the solar system at a high speed and passed near Mars on October 3, coming within 28 million km of the planet. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, where it exhibited a significant increase in brightness.</p>
<p>Following perihelion, 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, before moving towards Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is only the third such interstellar comet we’ve ever been able to study, and planetary scientists are super excited to learn about what comets in other solar systems are like,” said Jason Wright, an astronomer at Penn State.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The reason for 3I’s rapid brightening, which far exceeds the brightening rate of most Oort Cloud comets at similar distances, remains unclear,” wrote astronomers Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third interstellar object ever detected. Previous interstellar visitors, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, provided limited opportunities for detailed study. 3I/ATLAS offers a unique chance to understand the chemical makeup of material from another star system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible again in mid-November 2025. Scientists aim to analyze its gas and dust to gain insights into the environment of its home system and understand the mechanisms behind its rapid brightening.</p>
