      <h2>X-Ray Vision: Comet 3I/ATLAS Turns Green and Reveals Interstellar Secrets</h2>

<p>On December 13, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, has drawn global attention as it displays a rapidly changing chemistry. Astronomers are closely monitoring the comet as it approaches Earth, with its closest point occurring on December 19, 2025, at a safe distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it offers a unique opportunity for scientists to conduct a real-time chemical analysis of materials from a star system beyond our own. The comet was discovered by the ATLAS survey on July 1, 2025, and its hyperbolic trajectory confirms its non-native origin, meaning it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million km (1.8 AU).</li>
    <li>The comet has shown a distinctive green glow, indicating changes in its chemical composition.</li>
    <li>X-ray detection was first achieved on December 3, 2025, by ESA’s XMM-Newton from a distance of approximately 282–285 million km.</li>
    <li>Initial composition analysis has detected water ice, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbonyl sulphide, and nickel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey. Following its discovery, astronomers began monitoring its trajectory as it traveled toward the solar system. On October 29-30, 2025, the comet reached its perihelion, triggering a change in its outgassing profile.</p>
<p>On December 3, 2025, ESA’s XMM-Newton successfully detected X-rays emitted from the comet, marking a significant milestone in the study of interstellar objects. Recent images from the Gemini North telescope have shown the comet's transition to a greenish glow, indicating the release of volatile materials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of X-rays from 3I/ATLAS is a major breakthrough. It allows us to study elements that are nearly invisible to standard instruments,” said a spokesperson from ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered the solar system, following the detections of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. These objects provide insight into the composition of foreign star systems and the processes that govern their formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its decay rate and stability. Observations will help understand the comet's behavior before it fades from view in the spring of 2026.</p>
