      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Flies Past Mars, Spacecraft Capture Images</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed Mars, with spacecraft successfully photographing the interstellar comet on Saturday, October 7, 2025. This event marks the comet's closest approach to Mars, which is currently positioned on the same side of the solar system.</p>

<p>This occurrence is significant as it highlights the capabilities of spacecraft to capture images of celestial objects that originate from outside the Milky Way galaxy. The European Space Agency (ESA) has released a short movie showcasing images taken by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter during this event, demonstrating the instrument's versatility beyond its primary mission of studying Mars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object from outside the Milky Way.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Mars occurred on October 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images were captured by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which has been operational since 2016.</li>
    <li>The orbiter typically operates at an altitude of 250 miles above Mars' surface.</li>
    <li>Exposures for the comet images were five seconds long.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 20 million miles away during the imaging.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 7, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which usually focuses on the Martian surface, redirected its camera to capture the comet.</p>

<p>The ESA released a short movie displaying the images taken by the orbiter, showcasing the bright dot of the comet against the backdrop of distant stars. The orbiter's camera, designed for high-speed imaging of Mars, managed to capture the comet's light by utilizing longer exposure times.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nicolas Thomas, a professor of experimental physics at the University of Bern and principal investigator for the instrument, stated, “It is designed to observe Mars.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thomas noted the challenge of capturing the comet, saying, “Here, it was aimed at a dot nearly 20 million miles away, with five-second exposures, trying to make out something that was between 1/10,000th and 1/100,000th as bright as its usual observations.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each of these objects provides valuable insights into the composition and nature of materials from other star systems.</p>

<p>The successful imaging of 3I/ATLAS reflects advancements in space observation technology and the growing capability of spacecraft to study distant celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations and analyses of Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue as scientists seek to understand its properties and origins. Additional data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter may provide further insights into the comet's composition.</p>
