      <h2>3I/ATLAS makes Europe activate its largest planetary defence drill</h2>

<p>European authorities have activated their largest planetary defence drill in response to the 3I/ATLAS comet, which is set to make a close approach to Earth. The drill commenced on [not disclosed] and involves multiple countries and agencies coordinating their efforts to prepare for potential impacts.</p>

<p>This drill is significant as it marks a concerted effort by European nations to enhance their preparedness for potential asteroid or comet threats. Authorities are testing communication systems, response protocols, and public awareness campaigns to ensure a unified response in case of an actual event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth as part of its regular orbit.</li>
    <li>The defence drill involves multiple European nations and agencies.</li>
    <li>Start date of the drill: [not disclosed].</li>
    <li>Involved agencies: [not disclosed].</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities reported.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Authorities began planning the drill several months ago, responding to increasing awareness of potential threats from near-Earth objects. The 3I/ATLAS comet has been actively monitored as it approaches Earth, prompting the decision to launch this extensive drill.</p>
<p>On [not disclosed], the drill officially began, involving simulations and exercises to test emergency response systems and public communication strategies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This drill is a crucial step in ensuring our nations are ready to respond to any potential impact threats,” said a spokesperson for the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous drills have taken place in various regions, but this is the largest coordinated effort in Europe to date. The increasing frequency of near-Earth object discoveries has prompted authorities to take proactive measures to enhance planetary defence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor the approach of comet 3I/ATLAS and evaluate the effectiveness of the drill. Further assessments and potential follow-up drills may be planned based on the outcomes of this exercise.</p>
