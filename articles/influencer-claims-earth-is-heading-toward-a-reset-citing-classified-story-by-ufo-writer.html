      <h2>Influencer Claims Earth is Heading Toward a Reset, Citing Classified Story By UFO Writer</h2>

<p>A TikTok influencer has raised alarms about a potential global 'reset' by referencing a long-classified CIA document related to UFO researcher Chan Thomas. The influencer, known as Kela, made her claims in a viral video that links current geological events to Thomas's theories. The video has garnered significant attention, sparking renewed doomsday fears.</p>

<p>This situation has prompted discussions among scientists and the public regarding the implications of Thomas's theories. Authorities have not issued any official statements in response to Kela's claims, but the resurgence of interest in Thomas's work has led to increased scrutiny of geological activities around the world.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Influencer Kela cites Chan Thomas's book, The Adam and Eve Story, first published in 1963.</li>
    <li>Thomas's book was classified by the CIA in 1966 and declassified in 2013 with heavy redactions.</li>
    <li>Kela connects current geological events, including shifting magnetic poles and volcanic eruptions, to Thomas's theories.</li>
    <li>She mentions signs of increased seismic activity and solar storms impacting areas as far south as Tennessee, USA.</li>
    <li>Historically dormant volcanoes in Ethiopia and Antarctica are reported to show signs of activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1963, Chan Thomas's book, The Adam and Eve Story, is first published. In 1966, the CIA classifies the book, leading to years of speculation about its contents. After a Freedom of Information Act request, the book is declassified in 2013, albeit with significant redactions.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, influencer Kela posts a video linking current geological events to Thomas's theories, which quickly goes viral. She highlights various signs, including the movement of the magnetic north pole and the activity of previously dormant volcanoes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Scientists have confirmed the magnetic north pole is racing towards Siberia like it's got a date with it,” said Kela in her video.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “When we have solar storms giving us auroras as far south as Tennessee in the US, then yes, the magnetic field around us is weakening,” she added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims made by Kela align with Chan Thomas's theories, which suggest that the Earth undergoes catastrophic changes every 6,500 years. Thomas's assertion that a major disaster comparable to the biblical Great Flood will occur again has been a focal point for conspiracy theorists since the book's classification.</p>
<p>Previous discussions surrounding geological events have often included theories about pole shifts and their potential effects on civilization, though mainstream science does not support these catastrophic predictions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in Thomas's theories grows, scientists may conduct further investigations into the claims made by Kela. Public discourse surrounding these issues is expected to continue, particularly as geological events unfold globally.</p>
