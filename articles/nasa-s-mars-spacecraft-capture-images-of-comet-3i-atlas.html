      <h2>NASA's Mars Spacecraft Capture Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>At the start of October, three NASA Mars spacecraft observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from approximately 30 million kilometers away. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) captured close-up images, while MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) orbiter obtained ultraviolet images. The Perseverance rover also recorded a faint glimpse of the comet. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to these observations.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it allows scientists to estimate the comet's size and analyze its chemical composition. The data collected will enhance understanding of the comet's past, present, and future. 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>October 2, 2023: MRO observed 3I/ATLAS from 30 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>October 4, 2023: Perseverance rover captured images of the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered in our solar system.</li>
    <li>MAVEN captured images over a 10-day period starting September 27.</li>
    <li>Imaging scale from MRO was approximately 30 kilometers per pixel.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be closest to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 27, MAVEN began capturing images of 3I/ATLAS using its Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) camera. The observations continued for ten days, allowing for multiple captures in varying wavelengths. On October 2, the MRO obtained close-up images of the comet, marking one of the closest views from any NASA spacecraft. On October 4, the Perseverance rover recorded a faint image of the comet as it explored Jezero Crater.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Observations of interstellar objects are still rare enough that we learn something new on every occasion,” said Shane Byrne, HiRISE principal investigator at the University of Arizona in Tucson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The detections we are seeing are significant, and we have only scraped the surface of our analysis,” said Shannon Curry, MAVEN's principal investigator at the University of Colorado Boulder.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every measurement we make of this comet helps to open up a new understanding of interstellar objects,” said Justin Deighan, MAVEN's deputy principal investigator.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar object identified in the solar system, providing valuable opportunities for scientific study. Prior observations of interstellar comets have yielded insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from MRO and MAVEN. Further studies will focus on the chemical makeup of 3I/ATLAS to enhance understanding of its origins and evolution as it approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>
