      <h2>Trump Discusses UFOs and Aliens in Recent Speeches</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump has alternated between skepticism and curiosity about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and aliens during various interviews and public appearances. His remarks come amid increasing public interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) following recent reports and hearings from Congress and the Pentagon. A 2021 Pew Research Center survey indicated that nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of Americans believe that intelligent life could exist on other planets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump expressed skepticism about UFOs in June 2019.</li>
    <li>In June 2020, he hinted at undisclosed knowledge regarding the Roswell incident.</li>
    <li>On Logan Paul’s Impaulsive podcast in June 2024, Trump mentioned meeting pilots who described unusual sightings.</li>
    <li>He claimed to have access to information about UAPs during a podcast appearance.</li>
    <li>In September 2024, Trump reiterated that pilots reported seeing a “round object” moving faster than an F-22.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2019, Trump stated he had been briefed on Navy UFO reports but expressed doubt about their validity during an interview with ABC News. He reiterated his skepticism later that year in a conversation with Tucker Carlson, stating, “I tend to doubt it.”</p>

<p>In June 2020, Trump was asked by his son, Donald Trump Jr., about revealing information related to the Roswell incident. He responded by indicating that he found the topic "very interesting" but would not disclose details.</p>

<p>In June 2024, during an appearance on Logan Paul’s Impaulsive podcast, Trump mentioned speaking with pilots who reported seeing "things you wouldn’t believe." He maintained his skepticism but acknowledged having access to information regarding UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I did have one very brief meeting on it,” Trump said about UFO reports. “People are saying they’re seeing UFOs. Do I believe it? Not particularly.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I have met with people, serious people, that say there are some really strange things flying around out there,” Trump stated on the Impaulsive podcast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The question I may get more than any other is about aliens in Area 51,” Trump remarked on Greg Gutfeld's Fox News show.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Trump's comments reflect a broader national conversation about UFOs, which has gained traction following official investigations and disclosures from the government. The release of reports and congressional hearings has intensified public curiosity about UAPs and what the government knows about them.</p>

<p>Historically, UFO sightings have provoked a mix of skepticism and intrigue. Trump's remarks illustrate a balancing act between acknowledging public interest and maintaining a critical stance on the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As public interest continues to grow, further investigations into UAPs by government agencies are likely. Congressional hearings and reports may provide additional insights into what information is available regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
