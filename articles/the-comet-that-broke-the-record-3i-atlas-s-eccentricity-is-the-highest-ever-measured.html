      <h2>The comet that broke the record: 3I/ATLAS’s eccentricity is the highest ever measured</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope, has set a record for the highest orbital eccentricity measured at 6.14. This record-breaking eccentricity indicates a hyperbolic path from deep space, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides vital clues about interstellar objects and the cosmic origins beyond our Solar System. Authorities in the scientific community are actively studying 3I/ATLAS to gain insights into the building blocks of stars and planets in other systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Eccentricity:</strong> 6.14, the highest ever measured.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Entered the Solar System at 58 kilometres per second.</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> 1.36 AU, between Earth and Mars.</li>
    <li><strong>Peak speed at perihelion:</strong> 68 kilometres per second.</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus size:</strong> Estimated to be under 1 kilometre wide.</li>
    <li><strong>Emissions:</strong> Gases like cyanide and carbon dioxide detected.</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope. It entered the Solar System moving at a speed of 58 kilometres per second. The comet passed closest to the Sun, reaching perihelion at 1.36 AU, where it peaked at a speed of 68 kilometres per second.</p>

<p>Throughout its journey, observations from space telescopes, including Hubble and James Webb, have provided insights into its composition and dust tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet’s orbit has the highest eccentricity ever measured, showing just how stretched out its path is around the Sun,” said an astronomer involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Studying 3I/ATLAS helps scientists learn about the building blocks of stars and planets in other systems,” the astronomer added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its unique trajectory compared to previous interstellar visitors. Its orbit is tilted backwards by 175 degrees relative to the plane of the planets, meaning it moves in the opposite direction to most objects in the Solar System. This feature, along with its high speed, highlights the diverse nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gather more data and insights about interstellar objects and their implications for understanding the universe. Further observations from space telescopes are expected as the comet moves into interstellar space.</p>
