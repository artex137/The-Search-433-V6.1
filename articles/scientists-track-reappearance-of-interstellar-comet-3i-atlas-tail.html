      <h2>Scientists track reappearance of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS tail</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reestablished its tail after previously disappearing following its passage near the Sun. The Virtual Telescope Project captured new images of the comet on November 10, 2025, showing a clear ion tail extending from its nucleus.</p>

<p>This development is significant for scientists studying interstellar objects. The renewed tail indicates that the comet is actively releasing gases and dust, which can provide valuable data about its composition and behavior within the solar system. NASA and the European Space Agency plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed on November 10, 2025, at 11:31 p.m. Eastern Time (04:31 GMT on November 11).</li>
    <li>The images were taken using robotic telescopes in Manciano, Italy.</li>
    <li>The comet was 14 degrees above the horizon during the observation, with a 61 percent illuminated Moon affecting visibility.</li>
    <li>The ion tail extends approximately 0.7 degrees from the nucleus of the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object in the solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was previously observed to lack a visible tail after its perihelion, despite expectations based on its mass and composition. The tail has now reappeared, confirmed by images captured on November 10, 2025. The Virtual Telescope Project used 18 long exposure frames to create a single image of the comet, revealing a bright nucleus and a faint coma.</p>

<p>The ion tail is formed by solar ultraviolet radiation ionizing gases emitted from the comet's nucleus. Solar wind then pushes these charged particles away from the Sun, creating the characteristic tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If confirmed, it will be the third known interstellar object... providing more evidence that such interstellar wanderers are relatively common in our galaxy,” said Mark Norris, Senior Lecturer in Astronomy at the University of Central Lancashire.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project, noted that the team recorded “a much more developed ion tail” thanks to favorable weather conditions during the observation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov as the only confirmed interstellar objects to enter the solar system. These objects provide unique insights into the materials that exist in other star systems and how they behave when influenced by solar radiation and wind.</p>

<p>The previous disappearance of the tail raised questions about the comet's activity, but the recent observations confirm that it is still releasing material as it travels through the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026. Ongoing observations will focus on changes in the comet’s tail, coma, and nucleus, contributing to a better understanding of interstellar materials.</p>
