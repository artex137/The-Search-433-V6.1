      <h2>3I/ATLAS’ Bizarre Trajectory Suggests It Could Be Sending ‘Satellites’ to Spy on Jupiter: Harvard Scientist</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has claimed that comet 3I/ATLAS could be sending “satellites” to Jupiter for reconnaissance, with a close approach scheduled for March 16, 2026. Loeb made the remarks in a recent blog post, suggesting that the comet’s trajectory indicates it may be gathering intelligence for an “extraterrestrial civilization.”</p>

<p>This assertion raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential mission. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has calculated that during its closest approach, the comet will be approximately 53.445 million kilometers from Jupiter, close to the Hill radius where Jupiter’s gravity dominates. Loeb’s comments have sparked interest among the scientific community regarding the comet's unusual behavior and its implications for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to approach Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
    <li>It will be at a minimum distance of 53.445 million kilometers from Jupiter.</li>
    <li>The Hill radius is located at 53.502 million kilometers from Jupiter.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory provided the distance calculations.</li>
    <li>Loeb suggests that advanced satellites could be released near Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Jupiter, where it may utilize the planet’s gravitational pull to deploy additional probes. Loeb speculates that the comet might have adjusted its course during its passage near perihelion, which is its closest approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS has raised questions about its purpose, with Loeb highlighting the comet's unusual features and movements, which may suggest intelligent design.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It comes exactly at the right distance from Jupiter for Jupiter’s gravity to dominate,” Loeb told News Nation. “So, if it wants to release some probes near Jupiter, that’s where it needs to be.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If we find technological satellites of Jupiter that we did not send, it would imply that Jupiter is of interest to an extraterrestrial civilization,” Loeb said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time 3I/ATLAS has generated speculation regarding its origins and purpose. Loeb has previously noted that the comet exhibits anomalous behavior, including an anti-tail that points towards the Sun, which is atypical for comets. NASA has maintained that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, despite ongoing discussions about its unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, scientists will monitor the situation closely. Loeb hopes that future observations by the Juno spacecraft or other orbiters will provide insights into the comet’s trajectory and any potential objects it may release near Jupiter.</p>
