      <h2>Cosmic mystery deepens as 3I/ATLAS interstellar object shows sunward glow</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, has baffled scientists with its unusual trajectory in the solar system. The object was observed with a faint jet or anti-tail, roughly 5.9 kilometres from its nucleus, pointing towards the sun, as captured by the Two-Meter Twin Telescope in the Canary Islands.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges the conventional understanding of comet behaviour. Experts, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, are investigating the anomaly, questioning the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a typical comet. The findings could lead to new insights into the nature of interstellar objects and their interactions with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Date:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Two-Meter Twin Telescope, Canary Islands</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from nucleus:</strong> 3.7 miles (5.9 km)</li>
    <li><strong>Expert:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Observation:</strong> Hubble Space Telescope, late July</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1. Observations have continued since then, with significant findings made by both the Two-Meter Twin Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope. The unusual sunward glow was noted in late July, prompting further investigation.</p>

<p>Loeb has raised questions regarding the nature of the anti-tail and why experts have not acknowledged this anomaly in their assessments of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The existence of an anti-tail pointed toward the sun is an anomaly that raises two questions: What is the nature of the anti-tail? Why are comet experts ignoring this anomaly while insisting that 3I/ATLAS is a familiar comet?” - Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist
</blockquote>

<p>Loeb also noted that the glow exhibited by 3I/ATLAS was roughly ten times longer than it was wide, indicating a jet directed at the sun, which is unlike typical comet behaviour.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The classification of interstellar objects has evolved with advancements in astronomical technology. Previous incidents have shown that many objects can exhibit unexpected features, prompting ongoing debates within the scientific community regarding their origins and characteristics.</p>

<p>Loeb has previously suggested the extraterrestrial nature of 3I/ATLAS, which has added to the intrigue surrounding the object and its behaviour.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and its unusual features. Further investigations will aim to clarify the object's composition and behaviour, potentially leading to new understandings of interstellar objects.</p>
