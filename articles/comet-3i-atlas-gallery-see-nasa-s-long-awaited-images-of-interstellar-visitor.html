      <h2>NASA Releases New Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has released a series of images of comet 3I/ATLAS, providing detailed views of the interstellar object captured from various instruments, including those around Mars and the sun. The images were made public on November 19, 2023, after delays caused by the U.S. government shutdown from October 1 to November 12.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant for astronomers studying the comet, which is of natural origin and came from outside the solar system. NASA officials have emphasized the scientific importance of these observations, which aim to enhance understanding of the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images released on November 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 19 million miles (30 million kilometers) from Mars during imaging.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured an image in early October 2023.</li>
    <li>MAVEN orbiter obtained an ultraviolet image on September 28, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet passed Mars on October 4, 2023, while NASA's Perseverance rover observed it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. The U.S. government shutdown delayed the release of images, which were finally made public on November 19, 2023. Various instruments, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN, captured images of the comet as it passed Mars in early October.</p>

<p>On October 4, 2023, the Perseverance rover on Mars observed the comet during its exploration of Jezero Crater. The comet was notably brightening as it approached the sun, with images taken from different spacecraft highlighting its unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This object is a comet... and all evidence points to it being a comet. But this one came from outside the solar system, which makes it fascinating, exciting and scientifically very important,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya during the image release stream.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, there has been speculation about comet 3I/ATLAS potentially being an alien spacecraft. However, NASA has clarified that the comet is a natural object, consistent with typical comet behavior. This clarification has been important in guiding public perception and scientific discourse.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the images and data collected from comet 3I/ATLAS to enhance understanding of its composition and origins. Further observations from various space missions are expected as the comet continues its trajectory through the solar system.</p>
