      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaches closest proximity to Earth this Friday</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This close encounter marks the minimum distance between the comet and Earth, with no risk of collision. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have actively monitored the comet's passage using ground-based and space telescopes to gather data on its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest distance:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion passage:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated core diameter:</strong> Hundreds of meters to a few kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Future trajectory:</strong> Will pass near Jupiter in March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet was first detected in images captured in June 2025. It received official confirmation of its existence in July 2025 by the NASA-funded ATLAS project. After passing through perihelion on October 29, 2025, it exhibited cometary activity, including the formation of a coma and tail.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest approach to Earth, continuing its journey away from the Solar System. It is expected to pass near Jupiter in March 2026, which may alter its trajectory slightly due to gravitational influences.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The close passage of 3I/ATLAS presents a rare opportunity to study primordial materials from another star system,” said a representative from NASA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic trajectory indicates that it originated from outside the Solar System, distinguishing it from native comets that typically follow elliptical or parabolic orbits.</p>

<p>Previous observations have revealed that this comet displays a variable brightness and has a reddish dust tail. The unique composition of the comet suggests it formed in a different stellar environment than those typical of the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its close approach to Earth, astronomers will continue to analyze data collected during its passage. Planned observations with the Juno probe, which is currently orbiting Jupiter, aim to capture additional details of the comet's trajectory and behavior as it moves further into interstellar space.</p>
