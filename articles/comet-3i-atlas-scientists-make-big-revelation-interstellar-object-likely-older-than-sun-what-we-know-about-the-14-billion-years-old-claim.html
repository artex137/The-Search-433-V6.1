      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: Scientists Make Big Revelation, Interstellar Object Likely Older Than Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed object to enter our solar system from beyond, has been identified as potentially older than the Sun, according to astronomers at the University of Canterbury and the University of Oxford. The findings, based on early observations, suggest the comet may be between 8 and 14 billion years old, reshaping scientific understanding of cosmic history.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the formation of celestial bodies and the early universe. Authorities, including the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), have been instrumental in studying the comet's unusual chemical makeup and trajectory, which may indicate its origins in a cold region far from its original star.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system.</li>
    <li>It could be between 8 and 14 billion years old, making it potentially older than the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet was studied by researchers Michele Bannister from the University of Canterbury and Chris Lintott from the University of Oxford.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted using the Two-Meter Twin Telescope at Tenerife’s Teide Observatory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected as it entered the solar system. Between July and September 2025, astronomers monitored its trajectory and observed unusual jet-like structures. The comet's appearance evolved, displaying a fan-shaped dust cloud before developing a well-defined tail as it approached its closest point to the Sun in October 2025. Following its close approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, the comet has continued to move away from the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This distinct chemistry offers clues about the environment where the comet was born,” said Michele Bannister, highlighting the significance of the findings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Speculation about artificial origins has surfaced online, but there is no evidence supporting such claims,” noted researchers regarding the comet's unique characteristics.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS joins 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov as the only confirmed interstellar visitors detected so far. The study of these objects has become increasingly important for understanding the dynamics of our galaxy and the origins of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it exits the solar system, gathering more data to enhance our understanding of its origins and the early universe.</p>
