      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS from beyond solar system carries key molecule for life</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered that comet 3I/ATLAS is emitting significant amounts of methanol and other carbon-rich chemicals that likely played a crucial role in the origin of life. This finding was reported by Martin Cordiner from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and his team on December 5, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it indicates that 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to visit our solar system, differs markedly from typical comets found in our galaxy. Researchers are now studying the comet's chemical composition to better understand the conditions that may have led to life on Earth and elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar visitor to the solar system.</li>
    <li>It has been found to produce around 40 kilograms of methanol per second.</li>
    <li>Hydrogen cyanide is emitted at a rate of approximately 0.25 to 0.5 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>Methanol makes up about 8% of the total vapour from 3I/ATLAS, compared to 2% in typical solar system comets.</li>
    <li>The observations were made using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been traveling through the solar system, and as it approached the sun, it developed a significant envelope of water vapour and gas. This envelope contained higher levels of carbon dioxide than typical comets. Observations revealed that the comet began releasing gases while still far from the sun, suggesting it has not interacted closely with another star for hundreds of millions of years.</p>

<p>On December 5, 2025, Cordiner and his team published findings showing that the comet emits large quantities of methanol and hydrogen cyanide. This research provides new insights into the chemical makeup of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Molecules like hydrogen cyanide and methanol are at trace abundances and not the dominant constituents of our own comets,” says Cordiner. “Here we see that, actually, in this alien comet they’re very abundant.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It seems really chemically implausible that you could go on a path to very high chemical complexity without producing methanol,” Cordiner added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous research has suggested that comets rich in metals, such as iron, are likely to produce larger amounts of methanol due to chemical reactions between liquid water and iron compounds. These findings align with the compositions observed in 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>Understanding the chemical diversity of comets like 3I/ATLAS can help scientists learn more about the origins of life and the conditions necessary for it to arise in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study comet 3I/ATLAS to analyze its chemical composition further. This ongoing research may provide new insights into the formation of comets and the origins of life in the universe.</p>
