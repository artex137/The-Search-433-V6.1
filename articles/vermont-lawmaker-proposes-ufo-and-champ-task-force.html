      <h2>Vermont Lawmaker Proposes UFO and ‘Champ’ Task Force</h2>

<p>A Vermont lawmaker has introduced a bill to create a task force focused on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and other anomalous phenomena. Representative Troy Headrick, an Independent from Burlington, proposed the legislation on <strong>October 16, 2023</strong>, to investigate sightings of unknown aerial and underwater objects.</p>

<p>The Vermont Airspace Safety and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Task Force aims to assess airspace safety and coordinate with federal agencies and researchers. Headrick stated that the panel would help address emerging trends in public safety regarding unexplained phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Proposed by Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington.</li>
    <li>Bill number: H.654.</li>
    <li>Task force to investigate unknown aerial and underwater objects.</li>
    <li>Legislation drafted at the request of lobbyist Maggie Lenz.</li>
    <li>Focus on performance characteristics inconsistent with known technologies.</li>
    <li>Potential exploration of Vermont’s lake monster, Champ.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On <strong>October 16, 2023</strong>, Rep. Headrick introduced H.654 to the Vermont Legislature. The bill seeks to establish a task force that will investigate unusual aerial and underwater sightings, reflecting a growing concern about airspace safety and the use of drones in the state. Headrick noted that reports of unusual objects have been made to local police, indicating a need for a coordinated response.</p>

<p>The legislation has not yet been voted on by the committee, but it has garnered attention due to its dual focus on aviation safety and local cryptids.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I am not a subject matter expert at all. As policymakers, I think we have an obligation to remain attentive to emerging trends [in public safety]," said Rep. Troy Headrick.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "I’m certainly not saying that it’s aliens, but I do think just having the conversation here in Vermont will begin to allow for it to be taken a little bit more seriously," said Maggie Lenz, the lobbyist who requested the legislation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The proposed task force mirrors federal efforts to address unidentified anomalous phenomena, including the 2023 Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act and the establishment of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office by the Department of War. The growing interest in unexplained phenomena coincides with an increase in UAP reports nationwide, including a notable wave in New Jersey during 2024.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Vermont House Government Operations Committee will consider the bill in the coming weeks. If approved, the task force will begin its investigations into aerial and underwater phenomena, including potential discussions about Champ, Vermont’s legendary lake monster.</p>
