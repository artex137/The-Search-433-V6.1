      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS generates millions of false posts and AI reduces dissemination in hours</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has generated millions of false posts on social media since its discovery in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The rapid spread of misinformation began shortly after the Minor Planet Center published an electronic circular. No injuries or fatalities have been reported as a result of the misinformation.</p>

<p>This surge in false information has prompted researchers and space agencies to develop new tools to combat the spread of misinformation. The AstroBERT-v2 system, which uses artificial intelligence to detect false news, has proven effective in reducing the lifespan of pseudonews to about six hours. Authorities aim to preserve informational integrity as the comet continues to attract scientific interest.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Generated over 5.7 million posts in English by October 2025.</li>
    <li>More than 12,000 posts per hour during initial phases.</li>
    <li>62% of false information resulted from unintentional errors.</li>
    <li>6 YouTube channels accounted for 67% of misinformation.</li>
    <li>AI tool AstroBERT-v2 detects fake news with 94% accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Following the announcement, millions of posts emerged on social media platforms, with a significant portion containing misinformation. By October 2025, researchers had logged over 5.7 million posts in English, with 62% attributed to unintentional errors.</p>

<p>In response, scientists developed the AstroBERT-v2 system, which uses AI to identify and reduce the spread of false narratives. This system has reduced the lifespan of misinformation to approximately six hours, demonstrating a proactive approach to managing digital misinformation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The combination of AI and community participation decreased misinformation retweets by more than 50%,” said a spokesperson from the research team. “This case demonstrates the scalability of automated tools against mass infodemics.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The rapid spread of misinformation surrounding rare astronomical events has raised concerns among researchers and space agencies. Previous incidents have shown how quickly unverified narratives can proliferate, highlighting the need for effective countermeasures. The development of AI tools like AstroBERT-v2 represents a significant advancement in combating falsehoods in real time.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research into comet 3I/ATLAS will continue, focusing on its composition and trajectory. Authorities plan to further refine AI models to improve the detection of misinformation, especially in sensitive fields like astronomy.</p>
