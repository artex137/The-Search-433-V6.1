      <h2>Gli scientifically simulates the 3I/Atlas collision with an average speed of 72 km/s</h2>

<p>The Michigan State University Recorders have published a simulation analyzing the potential collision of comet 3I/Atlas with the Solar System, revealing an average impact speed of 72 kilometers per second. The study, conducted by researcher Darryl Seligman, does not report any injuries or fatalities related to the simulation.</p>

<p>This simulation is significant as it enhances understanding of interstellar engagements and the dynamics of potential impacts on Earth. Researchers aim to assess the risks associated with interstellar objects, especially as Earth’s orbital position can affect the trajectory and speed of incoming bodies. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring such studies to prepare for any future threats from interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Simulation speed: 72 km/s (259,200 km/h)</li>
    <li>Research conducted by Michigan State University</li>
    <li>Lead researcher: Darryl Seligman</li>
    <li>Interstellar object: 3I/Atlas, established in 2024</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>No immediate risk from 3I/Atlas reported</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The analysis of the 3I/Atlas simulation has occurred in the context of understanding interstellar engagements. The simulation indicates that the average speed of 72 km/s is derived from considering various factors, including the influence of Earth’s gravity and hyperbolic trajectories.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have crossed the Solar System, prompting ongoing research into the dynamics of such events. The simulation highlights the rarity of interstellar collisions in the short and medium term.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The simulation did not accurately reproduce the characteristics of these real objects. However, it highlights the rarity of interstellar collisions.” — Darryl Seligman
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This simulation builds on the understanding of interstellar objects, which have been largely neglected in the last few million years regarding potential impacts. The study of 3I/Atlas contributes to a growing body of research that seeks to understand the implications of such objects on Earth.</p>

<p>Previous studies have documented the dynamics of interstellar engagements, emphasizing the need for continued research in this field as Earth remains vulnerable to unknown threats from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the implications of the simulation and monitor the trajectory of 3I/Atlas. Further studies will focus on enhancing the accuracy of simulations and understanding the potential risks associated with interstellar objects.</p>
