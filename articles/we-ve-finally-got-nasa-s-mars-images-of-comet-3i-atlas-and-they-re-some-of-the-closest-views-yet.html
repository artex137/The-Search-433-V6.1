      <h2>NASA Captures Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS from Mars</h2>

<p>In October 2025, NASA's Mars spacecraft have captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing details of this interstellar object from the Martian surface. The images were taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, and the Perseverance rover during a period when the comet was hidden behind the Sun from Earth’s perspective.</p>

<p>The imaging campaign is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar comet that has not originated from our Solar System. Scientists are using these images to learn more about the comet's composition, shape, and trajectory while it is still observable.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images captured in October 2025 by NASA spacecraft.</li>
    <li>MAVEN started capturing images on 27 September 2025, over a 10-day period.</li>
    <li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images from 30 million kilometres (19 million miles) away on 2 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Perseverance rover captured an image of the comet on 4 October 2025.</li>
    <li>MAVEN used its Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) camera.</li>
    <li>HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was used to observe the comet.</li>
    <li>All images help identify hydrogen and estimate the comet's nucleus size.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's imaging of comet 3I/ATLAS began on 27 September 2025, when MAVEN started capturing images using its IUVS camera. Over the next ten days, MAVEN collected data in various wavelengths. On 2 October 2025, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took images from a distance of 30 million kilometres. Finally, on 4 October 2025, the Perseverance rover captured its own image of the comet from the Martian surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Observations of interstellar objects are still rare enough that we learn something new on every occasion,” says Shane Byrne, HiRISE principal investigator at the University of Arizona in Tucson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“One of MRO’s biggest contributions to NASA’s work on Mars has been watching surface phenomena that only HiRISE can see,” says MRO’s project scientist Leslie Tamppari of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being an interstellar comet, meaning it did not form within our Solar System. Its passage through the Solar System provides a unique opportunity for scientists to study its characteristics and gain insights into interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the data collected from the images to further understand the comet's properties and trajectory before it leaves the Solar System permanently.</p>
