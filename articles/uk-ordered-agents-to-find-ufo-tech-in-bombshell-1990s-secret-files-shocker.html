      <h2>UK ordered agents to find UFO tech in bombshell 1990s secret files shocker</h2>

<p>The British military actively sought extraterrestrial technology in the 1990s, according to recently unsealed files. The Defence Intelligence Staff, now known as Defence Intelligence, received directives to investigate “unidentified aerial phenomena” (UAP) following thousands of reported sightings in Belgium between November 1989 and April 1990.</p>

<p>This revelation highlights the UK's historical interest in UAPs and their potential implications for national defense. Current officials, however, have stated that the Ministry of Defence ceased investigations into UFOs in 2009 and do not plan to resume such efforts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Timeframe: Investigations focused on sightings from November 1989 to April 1990.</li>
    <li>Agency: Orders came from the UK’s Defence Intelligence Staff.</li>
    <li>Notable sightings: Reports of “large, silent, low-flying black triangles” and the 1980 Rendlesham Forest incident.</li>
    <li>Findings: Some sightings could not be explained by conventional science.</li>
    <li>Current status: Ministry of Defence has no plans to investigate UAPs as of December 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the late 1980s, a surge of UAP sightings occurred in Belgium, prompting UK intelligence to take action. In March 1997, an internal memo expressed concern about the potential threats posed by UAPs, suggesting they might have advanced propulsion technologies. Reports indicated that certain sightings demonstrated capabilities beyond known flight technology.</p>

<p>In 1980, the Rendlesham Forest incident involved a US Air Force base in Woodbridge, Suffolk, where a “craft of unknown origin” reportedly landed. This incident was confirmed by US military personnel, adding to the intrigue surrounding UAPs.</p>

<p>Despite many reported sightings being deemed non-credible, some remained unexplained and raised questions about their nature and potential impact on national security.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Logic would indicate that if significant numbers are reporting seeing strange objects in the sky then there may be a basis in fact,” stated an internal memo from March 1997.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Luke Pollard, the UK’s minister for defense readiness, noted in December 2024 that the Ministry of Defence had “ceased to investigate reports of UFOs or UAP in 2009.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, the UK has conducted investigations into UFO sightings, with various reports indicating interest from both military and intelligence communities. The French military has also shown interest in UAPs, and informal groups in the United States have explored similar topics. The documents reveal a persistent fascination with the potential technological advancements associated with UAPs.</p>

<p>While many sightings have been dismissed, the acknowledgment that some reports cannot be explained by current scientific understanding has kept the subject alive in public discourse.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, there are no plans for further investigations into UAPs by the UK Ministry of Defence. The future of UAP research remains uncertain, with no current deadlines or initiatives announced for revisiting the topic.</p>
