      <h2>3I/ATLAS Reaches Closest Point to Sun on October 29 as Surprising Nickel Discovery Fuels Mystery</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units (AU), or approximately 210 million kilometres. Scientists have discovered significant amounts of nickel vapor surrounding the comet, raising questions about its origins and composition.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the perihelion of the comet, a moment that allows astronomers to study its characteristics more closely. The discovery of nickel vapor suggests unusual chemical processes, prompting further investigation by multiple observatories and NASA spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion at 1.36 AU (210 million km) on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nickel vapor detected at extraordinary distances from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</li>
    <li>Comet travels at approximately 137,000 miles per hour (220,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Comet will not come closer than 170 million miles (1.8 AU) to Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered the comet on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects include ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. It has since been monitored as it approached the Sun, reaching its closest point on October 29, 2025. Throughout this time, astronomers have observed significant outgassing and the unusual presence of nickel vapor.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2025, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter passed the comet at a distance of 29 million kilometres. The comet is expected to reappear in predawn skies around December 2025, following its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is actively outgassing, meaning it has an icy nucleus and coma of gas and dust, classifying it as a comet rather than an asteroid,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object discovered in our solar system, following the detection of ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These discoveries have shifted scientists' understanding of comet origins, showing that they can come from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>The unusual nickel signature observed in 3I/ATLAS raises questions about the conditions under which it formed, suggesting a need for further research into its chemical composition and potential implications for planetary formation elsewhere in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its perihelion on October 29, 2025, scientists expect to conduct deeper analyses of the data collected from various telescopes and space missions. Research proposals from universities worldwide aim to study the comet's passing, which could provide new insights into the formation and chemistry of celestial bodies.</p>
