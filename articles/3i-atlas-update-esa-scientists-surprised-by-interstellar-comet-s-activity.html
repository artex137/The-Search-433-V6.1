      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: ESA Scientists 'Surprised' By Interstellar Comet's Activity</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has observed unexpected activity from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through our solar system. The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, is expected to make its closest approach to Earth in December 2025, before swinging towards Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) is actively investigating this rare cosmic visitor, as it is only the third object from another star system detected in our solar system. The urgency to understand 3I/ATLAS is heightened by its unusual characteristics and the limited time available to collect data on its composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth expected in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter anticipated in March 2026.</li>
    <li>Speed measured at approximately 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>Diameter of the comet's nucleus estimated between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Data from JUICE expected to arrive on Earth in late February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, during a routine survey by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The ESA began monitoring the comet shortly thereafter, utilising its Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft, which is on a decade-long mission. On November 2, 2025, JUICE captured preliminary images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing signs of activity as it neared its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun.</p>

<p>As the comet approached, astronomers noted a significant increase in the visibility of its plasma tail, a typical behaviour for comets exposed to solar radiation. The ESA has indicated that further analysis is ongoing, with full data expected to be transmitted back to Earth by late February 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “ESA scientists were 'surprised' by the image, finding the visitor to be 'surrounded by signs of activity' as it was being heated up by the Sun,” an ESA official stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its high carbon dioxide content relative to water ice, suggest it originated from a cold region of its parent star system, differing from typical solar system comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ESA will continue to analyse data from the JUICE spacecraft as it becomes available. The initial observations have already provided new insights into the nature of interstellar comets, and the awaited high-resolution data is expected to enhance our understanding of cosmic formation processes.</p>
