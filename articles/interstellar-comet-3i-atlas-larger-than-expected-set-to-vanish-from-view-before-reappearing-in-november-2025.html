      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS larger than expected, set to vanish from view before reappearing in November 2025</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has been observed by astronomers, is larger than previously estimated and is expected to disappear from view before reappearing in November 2025. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this phenomenon.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers and space enthusiasts as it provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. Authorities have been monitoring the comet’s trajectory and its physical characteristics closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is larger than earlier estimates suggested.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to vanish from view soon.</li>
    <li>It is set to reappear in November 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations are being conducted by astronomers worldwide.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been tracked since its discovery, with astronomers noting its size and trajectory. The comet has been under observation as it approaches its closest point to Earth. As it moves further away, it will become increasingly difficult to observe.</p>

<p>Predictions indicate that it will reappear in 2025, allowing for another chance to study its features and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The size of 3I/ATLAS has surprised many in the scientific community,” said an astronomer involved in the tracking of the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the study of interstellar comets has been limited. The observations of such celestial bodies can provide insights into the formation of the solar system and the materials present in interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches its disappearance, astronomers will continue to monitor it. Plans are in place for renewed observations when it reappears in 2025.</p>
