      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Shows Evidence Of “Galactic Cosmic Ray” Processing</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered that interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has undergone significant changes to its surface composition due to cosmic radiation during its journey through space. This finding was reported by a Belgian and American research team following observations made by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it alters expectations for the study of interstellar objects. Scientists had anticipated that 3I/ATLAS would yield pristine samples from another star system. However, the evidence suggests that cosmic ray processing has transformed the comet's outer layers, obscuring potentially unmodified material beneath.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Detection Date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Research Team: Belgian and American astronomers</li>
    <li>Key Measurement: Carbon dioxide to water ratio of 7.6 ± 0.3</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun during observations: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Depth of current outgassing activity: Approximately 15 to 20 meters</li>
    <li>NASA Lead Scientist: Tom Statler</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected by ATLAS on July 1, 2025. Subsequent spectroscopic analysis revealed significant changes to its chemical composition due to cosmic radiation. The research team evaluated various hypotheses regarding the object's formation conditions and concluded that cosmic ray processing is the most plausible explanation for the observed chemical signatures.</p>

<p>Observations made by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer contributed to the understanding of the object's properties. Ongoing monitoring by professional and amateur telescopes continues to gather data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite its unusual properties, 3I/ATLAS remains fundamentally cometary in nature,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for Solar System small bodies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous studies of interstellar objects have focused on their potential to provide insights into the conditions of distant protoplanetary disks. However, this discovery suggests that such objects may primarily serve as laboratories for studying cosmic-ray processing rather than pristine samples.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are cautiously optimistic that as 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, increased solar heating could trigger outgassing from deeper, unprocessed regions of the nucleus. Ongoing observations will be crucial to validate the cosmic ray processing hypothesis and to determine whether the modifications extend throughout the object or only affect surface layers.</p>
