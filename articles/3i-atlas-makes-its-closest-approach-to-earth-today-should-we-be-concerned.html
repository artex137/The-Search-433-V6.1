      <h2>3I/ATLAS Makes Its Closest Approach to Earth Today</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to Earth today, December 19, 2025, passing at a safe distance of about 170 million miles (270 million kilometers), roughly twice the distance from Earth to the Sun. Authorities have confirmed there is no risk of impact or harm from this third known interstellar comet.</p>

<p>This approach presents a unique opportunity for scientific study. NASA and other space agencies have assessed the comet's trajectory and confirmed its hyperbolic path, meaning it will exit the solar system without posing a collision risk. Astronomers are excited to observe the comet's material, which originates from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 170 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Up to 68 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered by:</strong> ATLAS telescope system</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Mainly carbon dioxide and water ices</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as a faint object on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system in Río Hurtado, Chile. Confirmation of its interstellar nature came on July 2, 2025, following 122 observations that confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory. The comet's closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 29, 2025, before it approached Earth today.</p>

<p>The object has been actively monitored through various telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS has been well-mapped, and there is no risk of collision,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This is an exciting opportunity for astronomers to study interstellar materials.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua discovered in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such comets allows researchers to gain insights into the composition of materials from other star systems, which is vital for understanding the formation of the solar system and beyond.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it exits the solar system. The data collected will contribute to ongoing research into the chemistry and dynamics of interstellar objects.</p>
