      <h2>3I/ATLAS Sparking Alien Fears: Harvard Scientist Claims Iron Levels Hint at Artificial Interstellar Origin</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked a debate about its origin following its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025 at approximately 6:00 UK time. The object passed at a distance of about 270 million kilometres (168 million miles) while travelling at an estimated speed of 153,000 mph.</p>

<p>This encounter has raised questions among scientists, particularly regarding the chemical composition of the comet. Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has suggested that unusual levels of nickel and iron may indicate an artificial origin. In contrast, NASA has asserted that there is "overwhelming evidence" that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet. The contrasting views highlight ongoing discussions about the possibilities of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>The object passed Earth at approximately 6:00 UK time.</li>
    <li>It travelled at a speed of 153,000 mph.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is located about 270 million kilometres (168 million miles) from Earth.</li>
    <li>Trajectory models indicate it will pass Jupiter in early 2026.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to clear the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune by 2028.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 19 December 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, prompting discussions among astronomers about its nature.</p>
<p>In October 2025, Avi Loeb published a blog post outlining his concerns about the chemical composition of the comet's coma.</p>
<p>Following the flyby, NASA reaffirmed its position that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, citing evidence from its behaviour and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb said, "Alien technology is a potential threat because when you go on a blind date of interstellar proportions, you never know whether you have a friendly visitor as your dating partner or a serial killer."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tom Statler, a lead scientist at NASA, stated, "The evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It's a comet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system. The debate surrounding its origin reflects a broader interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. Previous interstellar visitors have also prompted similar discussions, but mainstream science has generally classified them as natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its flyby, 3I/ATLAS is expected to continue on its trajectory out of the solar system, eventually becoming undetectable. Scientists will continue to monitor its path and gather data as it passes near other celestial bodies.</p>
