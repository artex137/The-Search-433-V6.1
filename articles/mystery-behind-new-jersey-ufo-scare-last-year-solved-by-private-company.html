      <h2>Mystery behind New Jersey UFO scare last year solved by private company</h2>

<p>A private contractor has claimed responsibility for the drone and UFO sightings that alarmed residents across New Jersey last year. The incidents occurred primarily in November 2024, when hundreds of mysterious "orbs" were reported in the skies, prompting concerns about national security. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these sightings.</p>

<p>This development matters as it addresses public fears that have been fueled by conspiracy theories regarding the drones. Authorities, including the FBI and the Pentagon, have reassured the public that the sightings do not pose a credible threat, but the mystery surrounding them has persisted. The contractor's disclosure may help quell some of the speculation that arose during the sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incidents began on November 13, 2024, above Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, NJ.</li>
    <li>Hundreds of drone sightings reported statewide into early December 2024.</li>
    <li>Contractor's representative claimed operations were conducted under a confidential government agreement.</li>
    <li>Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) attributed many sightings to hobbyists and recreational pilots.</li>
    <li>No credible threat identified by the FBI, White House, or Pentagon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The wave of reported drone sightings began on November 13, 2024, when residents spotted unusual orbs over Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County. The sightings continued throughout the state and persisted into early December. In January 2025, the Federal Aviation Administration revealed that many of the sightings were linked to hobbyists and private citizens rather than any organized operation.</p>

<p>In a recent development, a representative from an undisclosed contractor claimed responsibility for the drone activity, stating that they had been testing a piloted aerial vehicle during a high-level army conference. This revelation emerged from a source who attended the conference.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” a worker from the contractor reportedly told a small gathering following the presentation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that,” a source disclosed regarding the operations conducted above New Jersey.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The drone sightings have sparked numerous conspiracy theories, with some individuals suggesting they could be linked to foreign nations or even elaborate government plots. Speculation has included theories about nuclear warheads and the controversial 'Project Blue Beam,' which alleges that NASA plans to create a new world order through technology. Republican lawmakers have also voiced concerns that the drones could be tied to hostile governments.</p>

<p>Despite these theories, the FBI and other federal agencies have emphasized that there is no evidence to suggest any national security threat from the sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor the situation and investigate any remaining concerns related to drone activity. The contractor has stated they were not obligated to disclose their operations, but further inquiries may be made into the details of their activities in New Jersey.</p>
