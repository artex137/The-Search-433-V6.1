      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS is spewing life’s building blocks into space</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has become the focus of astronomers after it recently passed through the inner solar system, ejecting substances considered key components in the formation of organic chemistry. NASA has detected compounds such as methanol, cyanide compounds, and methane in the comet's ejecta.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as these molecules play a crucial role in the processes underlying life on Earth. However, scientists have emphasized that these substances can form without the involvement of living organisms, and their detection does not imply that the comet is biological or “alien” in origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It was observed moving at approximately 221,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The comet passed perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, in late October.</li>
    <li>In December, it came within about 270 million kilometers of Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA has detected methanol, cyanide compounds, and methane in the comet's ejecta.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 as an unknown celestial body. Astronomers noted its rapid movement within the orbit of Jupiter. In late October, the comet reached perihelion, marking its closest approach to the Sun. By December, it had traveled close to Earth, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of these compounds is important for understanding the building blocks of life, but it does not mean we are dealing with a biological entity,” said a NASA specialist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS’s journey through the solar system is significant as it may have traveled through interstellar space for billions of years, gaining speed as it passed various star systems and cosmic material. This comet's discovery adds to the ongoing research into the origins of organic materials and their role in the development of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it completes its journey through the Solar System, analyzing the data collected to further understand its composition and origins.</p>
