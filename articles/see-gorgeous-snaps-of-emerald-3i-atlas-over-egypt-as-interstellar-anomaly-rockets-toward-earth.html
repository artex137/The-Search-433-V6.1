      <h2>Emerald Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to fly by Earth on December 19, 2025. An amateur photographer, Osama Fathi, has captured a stunning image of the comet glowing green over the Egyptian desert on November 29, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's approach.</p>

<p>The close-up photograph has garnered attention from astronomers and space enthusiasts, as 3I/ATLAS is a rare interstellar visitor. Authorities and researchers are preparing for its closest approach to Earth, which will occur at a distance of 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li>Photographer: Osama Fathi</li>
  <li>Photo Taken: November 29, 2025</li>
  <li>Closest Approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
  <li>Distance at Closest Approach: 170 million miles</li>
  <li>NASA's Hubble Telescope captured images on: November 30, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 29, 2025, amateur photographer Osama Fathi captured an image of comet 3I/ATLAS in the Egyptian Black Desert. The photo shows the comet glowing green against a dark sky, enhanced by the absence of urban light pollution.</p>
<p>The following day, November 30, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope took additional images of the comet using its Wide Field Camera 3, revealing a blue glow as it traveled through the solar system.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“From the heart of Egypt’s Black Desert, where volcanic hills rise like silent sentinels... an object from another star system drifts through our sky: interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS,” said Osama Fathi in a statement to the BBC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These long integrations allowed the comet’s delicate coma and motion against the background stars to emerge clearly, even under the extremely dark Saharan skies,” Fathi explained regarding his photographic technique.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the few known interstellar comets, providing scientists with a unique opportunity to study material from outside our solar system. Prior to this, astronomers have observed other interstellar objects, but 3I/ATLAS's approach offers a chance for closer observation and analysis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Additional observations are planned to capture more data and images of the comet during its closest flyby.</p>
