      <h2>Prominent Astronomer Avi Loeb Proposes That An Interstellar Object Entering Our Solar System May Be A Spacecraft Powered By Nuclear Energy</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomer <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has suggested that the interstellar object known as <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, currently approaching the solar system, may be an alien spacecraft powered by nuclear energy. The object, which is the third known interstellar object observed, has garnered significant attention from both professional astronomers and amateur enthusiasts since its discovery.</p>

<p>This claim is notable as it challenges the prevailing view that 3I/ATLAS is simply a comet. Loeb’s assertions stem from the object’s unusual shape and its unexpected speed. As the object gets closer, astronomers have also detected a light emanating from it, which Loeb believes is generated by 3I/ATLAS itself rather than from external sources.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Third known interstellar object observed</li>
    <li><strong>Avi Loeb's Position:</strong> Harvard astronomer</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> October 2025 near Mars</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's Response:</strong> Receptive to using the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers first spotted 3I/ATLAS as it traveled toward the solar system, igniting excitement in the scientific community. Loeb has made his claims regarding the object’s nature based on its shape, speed, and the light detected from it. He has argued that there is no evidence of a typical cometary tail, which would be expected from a comet. Instead, he has proposed that the object may be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy.</p>

<p>In a recent blog post, Loeb outlined his reasoning and called for NASA to utilize the <strong>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</strong> during the first week of October 2025 to capture detailed images of 3I/ATLAS. NASA's HiRISE team has responded positively to his request.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “This morning, I encouraged the HiRISE team to use their camera during the first week of October 2025 in order to gather new data on 3I/ATLAS. They responded favorably.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb is known for making bold claims in the field of astronomy. His suggestion that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft adds to the ongoing discourse about the nature of interstellar objects. Previous interstellar objects have mostly been classified as natural phenomena, making this assertion particularly provocative. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretation of such objects and their implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars in October 2025, astronomers are preparing to gather more data. The outcome of these observations may confirm or refute Loeb's hypothesis, providing valuable insights into the object and interstellar phenomena.</p>
