      <h2>Pope 'preparing' for first contact with aliens this year, says UFO researcher</h2>

<p>A British documentary maker claims the Vatican may be preparing for potential contact with extraterrestrial life, with Pope Francis possibly addressing this issue within the year. UFO researcher Mark Christopher Lee has gained access to the Vatican's confidential archives as he investigates historical accounts of unexplained phenomena that could relate to human interactions with alien civilizations.</p>

<p>This development raises questions about the Catholic Church's stance on extraterrestrial life and its implications for theology and spirituality. Authorities, including the Vatican, may need to consider the ramifications of such discoveries on global faith communities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary maker: Mark Christopher Lee</li>
    <li>Access: Vatican's confidential archives</li>
    <li>Documentary title: God Vs Aliens</li>
    <li>Previous statements from Vatican astronomers on extraterrestrial life</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee has claimed rare access to the Vatican's archives and is currently investigating historical references to unexplained phenomena. He suggests that the Catholic Church has been contemplating the implications of discovering extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>In 2008, Father Gabriel Funes of the Vatican suggested that intelligent life could exist beyond Earth without contradicting Christian faith. Recently, Father Richard D'Souza, the Vatican Observatory's head, has stated he would be willing to baptise an alien.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I've been given rare access to the Vatican's secret archives. I'll be looking for any historical references to unexplained phenomena, spiritual encounters, or anything that could shed light on humanity's possible contact with intelligent life beyond Earth." 
    <strong>- Mark Christopher Lee</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "They are all part of God's creation. The question would be how to reach them or how they would reach us."
    <strong>- Father Richard D'Souza</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, Vatican astronomers have maintained that the existence of extraterrestrial life does not contradict Christian beliefs. Father Gabriel Funes previously stated that the notion of intelligent beings created by God could exist in the universe aligns with the Church's teachings.</p>

<p>As interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life has surged globally, Lee asserts that this moment could lead to significant changes in how faith interacts with science and the unknown.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee plans to continue his investigation into the Vatican's archives and will produce findings that may reveal the Church's preparedness for potential contact with extraterrestrials.</p>
