      <h2>3I/ATLAS Will Pass Closest to Earth in December: What to Know About the Interstellar Visitor</h2>

<p>Experts have confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will pass closest to Earth in December 2025. This event marks a significant moment for both scientists and astronomy enthusiasts as it represents a rare opportunity to observe an object formed outside our solar system.</p>

<p>The December 2025 encounter offers a unique viewing window for the comet, which is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor in history. NASA has stated that while 3I/ATLAS will not be visible to the naked eye, it can be observed with a small telescope through spring 2026. The agency's real-time simulator, Eyes on the Solar System, will track the comet's position and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
<li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 2025</li>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 137,000 mph at first detection</li>
<li><strong>Viewing Period:</strong> Through spring 2026 with a small telescope</li>
<li><strong>NASA Tool:</strong> Eyes on the Solar System for tracking</li>
<li><strong>Significance:</strong> Third confirmed interstellar object</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023. Astronomers confirmed its interstellar origin shortly thereafter. Since then, experts have been preparing for its closest approach, anticipated in December 2025.</p>

<blockquote>“This is an extraordinary chance to observe an object formed around another star,” said a NASA researcher. “These encounters are exceedingly rare in human history.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the paths of previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, which have captivated the scientific community and the public with their unique origins and trajectories. Each encounter with interstellar objects provides valuable insights into the formation of stars and planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As December 2025 approaches, astronomers and enthusiasts will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS's trajectory. Plans for public viewing events and educational outreach by NASA and other organizations are expected to be announced in the lead-up to the comet's closest approach.</p>
