      <h2>Did The Interstellar Comet 3I ATLAS Do Something With Our Sun?</h2>

<p>An interstellar object known as 3I ATLAS has generated a surge of online theories suggesting it may have caused the Sun to “glitch.” The speculation began on Reddit and quickly spread to TikTok, captivating thousands of users who believe the comet is an ancient alien spacecraft approaching our solar system. Scientists have stated that 3I ATLAS is a naturally occurring comet, detected on 1 July 2025 through the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</p>

<p>This matter has sparked significant interest as it highlights the intersection of science and popular culture. Various space agencies, including NASA, have confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth and is behaving like a typical comet, despite the rampant speculation online.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I ATLAS detected on 1 July 2025 in Chile.</li>
    <li>Third confirmed interstellar object after 1I 'Oumuamua and 2I Borisov.</li>
    <li>NASA describes it as a metal-rich comet on a hyperbolic orbit.</li>
    <li>Expected to pass the Sun and return to deep space by early 2026.</li>
    <li>No evidence linking 3I ATLAS to solar anomalies, according to NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers first detected 3I ATLAS through the ATLAS system in Chile. The discovery made headlines as it became the third confirmed interstellar object. Since then, theories about its nature have proliferated on social media platforms like Reddit and TikTok.</p>

<p>As 3I ATLAS approaches perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, observations have revealed typical comet behavior, including the formation of dust and gas tails.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comets do not possess enough mass or energy to alter solar dynamics,” an astrophysicist told Space.com.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The theories are imaginative, but not physically possible,” the astrophysicist added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The fascination with 3I ATLAS reflects a broader cultural interest in extraterrestrial life and cosmic phenomena. This interest has been fueled by popular media portrayals of space exploration and alien encounters, from films like 2001: A Space Odyssey to Interstellar. Despite the speculative nature of these theories, they have encouraged public engagement with astronomical sciences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories worldwide will continue to track 3I ATLAS as it approaches perihelion later this winter. Scientists will monitor its trajectory and behavior, aiming to further understand interstellar comets and their characteristics.</p>
