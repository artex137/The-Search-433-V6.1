      <h2>European Mars Orbiters observe interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>Between 1 and 7 October, the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express spacecraft have observed the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas during its close encounter with Mars. The comet approached within 30 kilometres of Mars on 3 October, with no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/Atlas is only the third known interstellar visitor to the Solar System. The data collected is expected to provide insights into the characteristics of the comet, which is believed to be shedding water as it travels through the Solar System. Scientists are analyzing the images and data captured by the orbiters to enhance understanding of this unusual object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas approached Mars on 3 October, coming within 30 km.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted by ExoMars TGO and Mars Express between 1 and 7 October.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of the comet is estimated to be about 1 kilometre wide.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar comet, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet was initially flagged on 1 July.</li>
    <li>It is expected to reappear from behind the Sun towards the end of November.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July, comet 3I/Atlas was initially flagged as an interstellar object. The ExoMars TGO and Mars Express began their observations of the comet between 1 and 7 October. On 3 October, the comet made its closest approach to Mars, coming within 30 km of the planet.</p>

<p>During the observations, ExoMars TGO captured a series of images showing a fuzzy white dot, indicating the coma surrounding the nucleus. Mars Express was unable to capture images of the comet due to its exposure time limitations. Scientists are now stacking images from Mars Express to see if they reveal the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The cameras on the spacecraft were designed to image the bright surface of Mars, and not an interstellar comet,” said a spokesperson for the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is notable for being only the third interstellar object observed in the Solar System. The previous two, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, were detected in 2017 and 2019, respectively. These interstellar comets provide unique opportunities for research into the composition and behavior of celestial objects from beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the images and spectrometer data captured by the orbiters. The comet is currently hidden from view from Earth and is expected to be observable again towards the end of November.</p>
