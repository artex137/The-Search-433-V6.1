      <h2>Scientist Confirms No Color Change for Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been confirmed to have no significant color change by scientist Qicheng Zhang from the Lowell Observatory. This announcement comes after the comet made its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2023, where it attracted attention from astronomers and space agencies. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet's observations.</p>

<p>The significance of this confirmation lies in the ongoing interest in the comet, which is the third known interstellar comet to enter our solar system. Authorities and researchers are actively studying 3I/ATLAS to enhance understanding of interstellar materials and comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun occurred on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>Observations involved three spacecraft and numerous telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>Upcoming closest pass to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Visual observations indicated a blue/green color of the gas coma in early September 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2023. It made its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2023, during which it underwent a rapid brightening. Observations from various spacecraft and telescopes have contributed to the ongoing study of the comet. Reports of its color change were clarified by Qicheng Zhang, who stated that the comet's apparent color shift was due to the visibility of its gas coma.</p>

<p>In early September 2023, amateur astronomers noted the blue/green color of the coma, but Zhang emphasized that no significant color change has occurred.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no evidence of a significant color change in the gas coma of the comet,” said Qicheng Zhang from the Lowell Observatory. “The brightness results from the sustained presence of its gas coma.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet discovered to date. Previous interstellar comets, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, also garnered significant scientific interest. Each of these comets has provided unique insights into the materials and processes that exist outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth on December 19, 2023. This close pass offers a unique opportunity for further observations and analysis of interstellar materials.</p>
