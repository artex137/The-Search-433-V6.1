      <h2>Fact Check: Did Seth Meyers predict Trump would release UFO files amid Epstein fallout?</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON, DC: President Donald Trump has announced plans to direct officials to identify and release government files related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life, prompting social media users to claim comedian Seth Meyers had predicted this move months earlier. The posts suggest that Meyers indicated Trump would unveil alien information to distract from controversy surrounding files tied to Jeffrey Epstein. However, the accuracy of this claim warrants examination.</p>

<p>This matter has gained traction as renewed attention focuses on documents connected to Jeffrey Epstein. Social media users have interpreted Trump’s directive regarding UFO files as aligning with Meyers’ earlier remarks, suggesting a strategic distraction from potentially damaging information. Authorities have not yet responded to the claims regarding Meyers' predictions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump announced plans on Truth Social to release UFO files on <strong>October 2023</strong>.</li>
    <li>Meyers commented on the potential for a UFO announcement on <strong>July 24, 2023</strong>.</li>

He stated, “Whatever is in those Epstein files must be really bad.” Meyers suggested the administration could become “so desperate to distract everyone” that Trump might pivot to UFOs.</p>

<p>On <strong>October 2023</strong>, Trump posted on Truth Social, expressing his intention to direct relevant departments to identify and release government files related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life. His statement concluded with “GOD BLESS AMERICA!”</p>
