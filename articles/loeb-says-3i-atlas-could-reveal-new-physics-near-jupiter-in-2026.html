      <h2>Loeb Says 3I/ATLAS Could Reveal New Physics Near Jupiter In 2026</h2>

<p>As the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter on 16 March 2026, scientists are preparing to observe potential new physical phenomena. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has stated that the comet’s collision with Jupiter could serve as a natural experiment, challenging existing scientific understanding.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant because it presents an opportunity to explore anomalies in comet behavior that could inform our knowledge of physics. Authorities, including NASA, are considering specific maneuvers for the Juno spacecraft to enhance observations of the comet as it comes within 53.56 million kilometres of Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of approach: 16 March 2026</li>
    <li>Distance from Jupiter: 53.56 million kilometres</li>
    <li>NASA spacecraft involved: Juno</li>
    <li>Proposed maneuver: Juno Oberth manoeuvre</li>
    <li>Proximity goal: 27 million kilometres from 3I/ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 16 March 2026, the comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Jupiter. The encounter will allow scientists to observe the comet's behavior and its gravitational interactions with the planet. Loeb has indicated that this event is an opportunity to reconsider current scientific models.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Instead of considering anomalies as footnotes, we should view them as possible openings to new physics,” said Loeb. “The encounter with Jupiter may serve to close gaps in our understanding of space and cosmic matter.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb has previously referred to 3I/ATLAS as a 'message in a bottle,' emphasizing that humanity is not the primary focus of cosmic events. The upcoming flyby of Jupiter reinforces this perspective, suggesting that cosmic phenomena may not directly benefit Earth but instead broaden our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As March 2026 approaches, scientists will be closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS’s behavior. They aim to gather data that could either confirm existing scientific models or reveal new phenomena that challenge current knowledge.</p>
