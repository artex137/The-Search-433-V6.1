      <h2>Soldiers turned to stone by angry aliens and 'jellyfish' UFO in Soviet X-Files</h2>

<p>A 'jellyfish' UFO hovered for an hour above Nalchik, southern Russia, in February 1989, according to recently released Soviet-era files. The incident is part of a collection documenting mysterious aerial phenomena, which authorities in the former USSR discreetly evaluated while publicly dismissing claims of extraterrestrial vessels as Western propaganda. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this specific sighting.</p>

<p>The release of the files, translated into English by journalist George Knapp, provides insight into how Soviet organizations catalogued what they referred to as 'Abnormal Atmospheric Phenomena' during the 1970s and 1980s. This information comes at a time when interest in UFOs and their implications for national security continues to grow.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The 'jellyfish' UFO sighting occurred on February 13, 1989.</li>
    <li>The object was reported to have been visible for over an hour.</li>
    <li>The files were smuggled out of Russia in the early 1990s.</li>
    <li>Documentation spans approximately 70 pages.</li>
    <li>Reports include accounts from the public, military personnel, and technical experts.</li>
    <li>A notable incident in 1993 involved soldiers allegedly turned into stone after an encounter with a UFO.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In February 1989, observers in Nalchik reported a large aerial object resembling a jellyfish, which remained suspended in the sky for over an hour before disappearing. The incident is documented in files that were later smuggled out of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>In 1993, another significant event occurred when state media claimed that the military shot down an extraterrestrial vessel in Siberia. Witnesses reported that five humanoid entities emerged from the wreckage, which subsequently transformed into a luminous sphere, allegedly turning 23 nearby soldiers into stone pillars. Only two witnesses are said to have survived this incident.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The documentation reveals a systematic attempt to monitor cases that couldn’t be easily categorized into established frameworks,” said George Knapp, who translated the files.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If these accounts are genuine, they signify a highly perilous threat from advanced extraterrestrial technology,” noted US intelligence officials of the era.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The release of these files sheds light on the Soviet Union's approach to unidentified aerial phenomena during the Cold War. While the documents do not provide definitive proof of extraterrestrial life, they indicate that authorities were concerned about the implications of such sightings and monitored them closely.</p>

<p>Previous incidents, such as the 1993 case of soldiers turned to stone, have contributed to ongoing speculation regarding UFOs and potential military encounters with advanced technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any ongoing investigations related to these historical sightings. The release of the files may prompt further examination of past incidents and their implications for current security assessments regarding aerial phenomena.</p>
