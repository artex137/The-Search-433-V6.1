      <h2>UFO? Military operation? Questions surround balloon seen above Colorado mountains</h2>

<p>Residents of Colorado have reported sightings of a strange balloon floating across the state on Tuesday, prompting inquiries into its origin and purpose. The Moffat County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the balloon was a Stratollite, owned by World View Enterprises, a private company based in New Mexico that conducts high-altitude research.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service has identified the balloon as part of a research and development flight. Authorities are currently monitoring its trajectory, which has taken it from Craig to Boulder County and then toward Routt County before heading south-southwest. The sightings have raised questions about airspace safety and the nature of such high-altitude operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Balloon sighted on Tuesday, not disclosed time.</li>
    <li>Reported by Moffat County Sheriff’s Office.</li>
    <li>Launched 42 days prior from Tucson, Arizona.</li>
    <li>Operated by World View Enterprises, a private research company.</li>
    <li>Typical flight altitude between 75,000 and 100,000 feet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, residents in Colorado spotted a balloon drifting across the sky. The Moffat County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the balloon's identity as a Stratollite. By Wednesday, the balloon had continued its path toward the Four Corners region.</p>

<p>Phil Wocken, vice president of World View Enterprises, stated that the balloon had been launched from the company’s headquarters in Tucson, Arizona, 42 days prior to the sightings. He explained the balloon's ability to navigate using four-directional winds at different altitudes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That is one of our Stratollites, which is a fancy name we give to one of our stratospheric high-altitude balloon systems. Some people label these as weather balloons because that’s what’s familiar,”</blockquote>
<p>— Phil Wocken, vice president of World View Enterprises.</p>

<blockquote>“We’ll then increase and decrease altitude thousands of times during a flight to navigate the system.”</blockquote>
<p>— Phil Wocken, vice president of World View Enterprises.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a similar occurrence nearly a year ago when another balloon from World View Enterprises was reported over the Denver metro area, carrying a NASA payload. Such balloons are generally not visible to the naked eye due to their high altitudes.</p>

<p>The increasing frequency of high-altitude balloon flights has sparked discussions about airspace management and the need for public awareness regarding these operations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>World View Enterprises will continue to monitor the balloon's trajectory and operations. Authorities will assess the implications of these flights on airspace safety as the company prepares for future launches.</p>
