      <h2>NASA Unveils 3I/ATLAS Photos Tonight: Is The Mysterious Object an Alien Probe?</h2>

<p>NASA is set to unveil new photos and information about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS tonight at 9 p.m. Paris time. This comet, which has travelled billions of years from an unknown star system, has excited the global astronomical community due to its rarity and the speculation surrounding its nature.</p>

<p>The unveiling matters as it could provide crucial insights into the origins and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. The comet is only the third known interstellar comet, following 1I/'Oumuamua' in 2017 and 2I/'Borisov' in 2019. Scientists are eager to determine whether it behaves like a typical comet or if it exhibits unusual features.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system.</li>
    <li>It is moving at an inbound velocity of approximately 58 kilometres per second (36 miles per second).</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometres (168 million miles).</li>
    <li>NASA will release new images and data tonight at 9 p.m. Paris time.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope estimates the comet's nucleus size to be between 320 metres (1,050 feet) and 5.6 kilometres (3.5 miles) in diameter.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is believed to contain a high concentration of carbon dioxide, indicating it formed in a very cold environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system, which monitors the sky for moving objects. Shortly after its discovery, scientists confirmed that it is not from our Solar System and is on a one-way path through space.</p>
<p>The comet passed its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025, and is now on its way to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What does 3I/ATLAS really look like? Does it behave like a normal comet? Is its shape or tail in any way peculiar?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every new photograph carries the possibility of an extraordinary reveal.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar comet discovered, raising questions about the nature of celestial bodies that originate outside our Solar System. The previous interstellar visitors, 1I/'Oumuamua' and 2I/'Borisov', sparked significant interest and debate within the scientific community regarding their origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following tonight's update, scientists will analyze the new data and images to further understand 3I/ATLAS. Observations will continue as the comet approaches Earth, providing a unique opportunity to study its properties before it leaves our planetary neighborhood.</p>
