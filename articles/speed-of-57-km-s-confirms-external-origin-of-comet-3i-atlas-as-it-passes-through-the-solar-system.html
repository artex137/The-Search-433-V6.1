      <h2>Speed of 57 km/s confirms external origin of comet 3I/Atlas as it passes through the solar system</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/Atlas has been confirmed as an interstellar object, traveling through the solar system at a speed of 57 km/s. This significant discovery comes as the comet approaches its closest point to the Sun, scheduled for November. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>The confirmation of 3I/Atlas as an interstellar comet is important for the scientific community as it provides a unique opportunity to study the formation of distant star systems. Authorities, including global observatories, are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory to collect valuable data before it exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is traveling at 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun in November 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas has been confirmed as the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>Preliminary observations show it maintains its speed without acceleration from solar proximity.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibits a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it will not return.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been moving through the solar system since it was first detected. The comet's speed has been consistent since its entry into the heliosphere, independent of its distance from the Sun.</p>
<p>Observations of 3I/Atlas began as it approached the solar system, with various observatories around the world conducting spectroscopic analyses to confirm its chemical composition and interstellar origin.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches its closest point to the Sun, scientists are prioritizing data collection to gain insights into its characteristics and origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/Atlas offers a unique opportunity to test the laws of celestial mechanics under extreme conditions,” said a spokesperson for the global astronomical community.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“By analyzing the light reflected and emitted by 3I/Atlas, we can collect samples from another star system without the need for lengthy space missions,” noted an astrophysicist involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of interstellar objects has increased significantly since the discovery of Oumuamua in 2017. Comet Borisov followed in 2019, presenting similarities to local comets. The arrival of 3I/Atlas marks a new benchmark in interstellar astronomy due to its high speed and distinct trajectory.</p>
<p>These discoveries have prompted scientists to reconsider the frequency and characteristics of interstellar visitors, suggesting they may be more common than previously thought.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its path through the solar system, astronomers will focus on capturing as much spectral data as possible. This information will aid in understanding the comet's internal structure and its implications for planetary formation theories.</p>
