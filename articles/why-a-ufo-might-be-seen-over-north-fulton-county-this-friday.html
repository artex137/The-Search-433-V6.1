      <h2>Why a 'UFO' might be seen over North Fulton County this Friday</h2>

<p>Residents of Alpharetta, Georgia, might see a balloon resembling a UFO in the sky on Friday, October 17, between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. City officials have confirmed that the balloon test is part of the Alpharetta District Places project, which aims to demonstrate the height of proposed new buildings.</p>

<p>The balloon test is intended to provide residents with a visual representation of how tall the proposed buildings would appear from ground level. City leaders have postponed a vote on the mixed-use development to allow for further public input and review. The project is set to include 195 rental apartments and approximately 35,000 square feet of retail and commercial space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
