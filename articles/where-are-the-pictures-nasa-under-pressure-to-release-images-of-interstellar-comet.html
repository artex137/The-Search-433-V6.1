      <h2>Where are the pictures? Nasa under pressure to release images of interstellar comet</h2>

<p>Nasa is facing growing pressure to release high-resolution images of the interstellar comet 3IATLAS, captured during its closest approach to Mars on October 2, 2025. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has formally requested the imagery, citing the intense public and scientific interest in the comet's unusual behaviour.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as it may provide insights into the comet's unexpected non-gravitational acceleration and brightening, which differ from typical cometary activity. Nasa has yet to disclose the specific reasons for withholding these images, despite having released other data from space observatories.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3IATLAS was first detected in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is one of three known interstellar objects passing through the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibited unusual acceleration and brightness nearing perihelion.</li>
    <li>High-resolution images were captured on October 2, 2025, during its close flyby.</li>
    <li>Observations have been made using Nasa’s Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes.</li>
    <li>Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has requested the release of the imagery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3IATLAS was first detected in July 2025. On October 2, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to Mars, during which high-resolution images were captured. Despite this, Nasa has not yet released these images to the public.</p>

<p>Since the detection of 3IATLAS, it has generated significant interest due to its unusual behaviour, prompting calls for transparency from both the scientific community and the public.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The release of these images could reveal new physical phenomena, potentially deepening or reshaping our understanding of interstellar objects." — Experts in the field.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behaviour of 3IATLAS distinguishes it from typical cometary activity, which usually involves brightness variability and orbital shifts due to sublimation-driven venting. The comet's non-gravitational acceleration has raised questions about its nature and origins, intensifying scientific debate.</p>

<p>While Nasa has released data from various space observatories, the specific images from the Mars flyby remain undisclosed, leading to concerns regarding transparency and the verification of scientific findings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As public and scientific scrutiny of 3IATLAS continues to grow, Nasa faces increasing pressure to share the high-resolution images. The agency has not announced a timeline for the release or provided further updates on the status of the imagery.</p>
