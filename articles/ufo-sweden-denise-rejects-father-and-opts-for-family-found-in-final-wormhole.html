      <h2>Denise rejects father and opts for family found in final wormhole</h2>

<p>In the film <strong>UFO Sweden</strong>, directed by Victor Danell, protagonist Denise has chosen to reject her father in favour of a family she has found through a final wormhole. The film, set primarily in the 1990s in Suécia, explores themes of personal loss, family bonds, and the search for answers in the face of inexplicable phenomena.</p>

<p><strong>UFO Sweden</strong> has gained international attention since its original release in December 2022. It highlights the experiences of Denise, who, after losing her father Uno in 1988, embarks on a journey with a group of UFO enthusiasts to investigate gravitational anomalies. Their findings lead to theories about dimensional portals, challenging the official narrative surrounding her father's disappearance.</p>
