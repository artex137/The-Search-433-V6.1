      <h2>Physicist warns ‘3I ATLAS jets may change its orbit to intercept Earth’</h2>

<p>A physicist has stated that the interstellar object 3I/Atlas may have altered its trajectory and could potentially intercept Earth. The object, traveling at 209,215 kilometres per hour, was detected on July 1 and has raised concerns among millions globally, particularly following theories suggesting it might be an "alien mothership." Experts from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) first identified the object, prompting heightened alertness from scientists, astronomers, and space agencies, including NASA.</p>

<p>This situation is significant as it raises questions about the object's trajectory and its implications for Earth. NASA has officially added 3I/Atlas to its watchlist as a 'planetary threat.' Dr. John Brandenburg, a physicist, has warned that the observed changes in the jets of 3I/Atlas may lead to a course change towards Earth, potentially resulting in a catastrophic collision.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Speed: 130,000 mph (209,215 km/h)</li>
    <li>Date detected: July 1</li>
    <li>Watchlist status: Added by NASA as a 'planetary threat'</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29-30</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, scientists detected the interstellar object 3I/Atlas. Since then, concerns have emerged regarding its trajectory, with physicist Dr. John Brandenburg suggesting it may now be on a path to intercept Earth. The object will reach its closest point to the Sun between October 29 and 30, during which scientists will monitor any changes in its energy levels.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The full effect of the observed changes in the 3I ATLAS jets may be to change its orbit to intercept Earth,” said physicist Dr. John Brandenburg.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Perhaps this is a visitor, an intelligent visitor from another solar system,” stated Professor Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“From an engineer’s perspective, 3I/Atlas is a mothership that releases mini-probes,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the detection of 3I/Atlas, there have been various instances of interstellar objects passing through the solar system, but none have raised as much concern among scientists. Theories regarding extraterrestrial intelligence have circulated in the scientific community, although they remain speculative. The unusual behavior of 3I/Atlas, particularly its lack of a visible tail, has prompted further investigation into its nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will closely monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun at the end of October. They aim to determine if it gains additional energy, which could influence its trajectory and potential threat to Earth.</p>
