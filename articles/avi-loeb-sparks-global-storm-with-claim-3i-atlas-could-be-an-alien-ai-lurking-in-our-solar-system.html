      <h2>Avi Loeb Sparks Global Storm With Claim 3I/ATLAS Could Be an Alien AI Lurking in Our Solar System</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb has proposed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS might be an alien artificial intelligence (AI) probe, igniting widespread debate within the scientific community and among the public. The object was detected by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile in July 2025, marking it as only the third known object from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>This hypothesis raises significant questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and has prompted reactions from various scientific authorities. Loeb's claims have entered mainstream discussions, leading to scrutiny of both the object and the transparency of data shared by space agencies regarding its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>3I/ATLAS was detected by the ATLAS survey telescope in July 2025.</li>
<li>Loeb published his hypothesis in a blog post titled 'What if 3I/ATLAS Is AI/ATLAS?'.</li>
<li>NASA maintains that 3I/ATLAS is a natural cometary body.</li>
<li>Multiple telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, have provided observational evidence of classical cometary signatures.</li>
<li>The object has been classified as a comet by many astronomers based on its behaviour.</li>
<li>Loeb has requested high-resolution images from NASA of 3I/ATLAS taken near Mars in October 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was detected by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Loeb's hypothesis emerged shortly thereafter in a blog post, suggesting that the object could be an AI probe. Following this, various telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, provided evidence supporting its classification as a natural comet. In October 2025, 3I/ATLAS approached Mars, leading Loeb to request high-resolution images from NASA, which he claims have not been adequately provided.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The conventional explanation—that 3I/ATLAS is a comet comprised of ice and dust originating from another star system—remains the most likely scenario,” Loeb stated. “However, its unusual features deserve deeper scrutiny.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA has emphasized that “its findings to date show behaviour consistent with known comet physics.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate around 3I/ATLAS has sparked broader discussions about the nature of interstellar objects and the limits of scientific interpretation. Critics argue that Loeb's framing of the object risks conflating curiosity with speculation, potentially misleading public understanding of science. The response from the astronomical community has been largely sceptical, reaffirming the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the discussion continues, the scientific community is expected to further analyze 3I/ATLAS and its characteristics. Loeb's calls for clearer data from NASA may lead to renewed scrutiny of space agency practices regarding data transparency and public communication about interstellar phenomena.</p>
