      <h2>3I/ATLAS, Earth and Sun enter rare alignment on January 22: Here is why it matters</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS will reach a rare alignment with the Sun-Earth axis on January 22, 2026. The comet will come within an exceptionally small angle of 0.69 degrees from the axis, providing a unique opportunity to study its features and behaviour.</p>

<p>This alignment will allow scientists to observe the comet's anti-tail and its unusual gas plumes. The phenomenon known as "the opposition surge" will also be measured, where dust reflects sunlight more brightly. Researchers aim to gain insights into the composition of 3I/ATLAS, which has puzzled scientists since its discovery on July 1, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> January 22, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Alignment Angle:</strong> 0.69 degrees</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Glow Extent:</strong> Over 130,000 kilometres towards the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Mini-Jets:</strong> Three mini-jets are present, spaced at 120 degrees from each other</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Since then, scientists have monitored its trajectory and behaviour. The upcoming alignment on January 22, 2026, has been identified as a significant opportunity for observation.</p>
<p>During this alignment, 3I/ATLAS will be viewed from the direction of the Sun, allowing for clearer observations of its anti-tail and mini-jets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This alignment gives us a chance to learn about interstellar objects and the material they carry,” said a spokesperson from the research team studying 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 2I/Borisov and Oumuamua. Previous objects did not provide ideal conditions for thorough analysis. 2I/Borisov did not align closely enough, while Oumuamua lacked sufficient dust for observation.</p>
<p>The upcoming alignment marks a rare chance to study an object that has been travelling for billions of years, potentially revealing new information about the origins of interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will conduct observations on January 22 to analyze the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of interstellar objects and the dynamics of space.</p>
