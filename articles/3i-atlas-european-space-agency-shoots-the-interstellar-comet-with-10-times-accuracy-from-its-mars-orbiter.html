      <h2>3I/ATLAS: European Space Agency Shoots The Interstellar Comet With 10 Times Accuracy From Its Mars Orbiter</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has successfully pinpointed the trajectory of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with ten times more accuracy than previous measurements, using data from its Mars-based Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). This achievement comes as 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this event.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it marks the first instance where an official comet trajectory has been determined using data from another planet. The ESA has stated that this exercise enhances planetary defense capabilities, as it demonstrates the value of triangulating data from Earth with observations made from space. ESA routinely monitors near-Earth objects to provide warnings if necessary.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Trajectory pinpointed with ten times more accuracy using data from ESA's TGO.</li>
    <li>Closest flyby of Mars occurred between October 2 and 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>ESA published images of the comet on November 14, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet made its closest flyby of Mars on October 2 and 3, 2025. On November 14, 2025, ESA announced that it had accurately determined the comet's trajectory using data from its TGO spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have pinpointed the comet's path with 10 times more accuracy, using data from our ExoMars TGO probe,” ESA stated on social media.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Even though 3I/ATLAS poses no threat, it was a valuable exercise for planetary defense,” ESA added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event follows the discovery of previous interstellar objects, including the well-known 'Oumuamua. Researchers have debated the nature of 3I/ATLAS, with some proposing theories about its potential as an alien probe, while others regard it as a typical comet. The ongoing observations and analyses contribute to the broader understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and will provide further updates on its trajectory and characteristics. The data obtained from this event will also inform future planetary defense strategies.</p>
