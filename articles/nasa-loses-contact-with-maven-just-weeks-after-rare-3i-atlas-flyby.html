      <h2>NASA Loses Contact With MAVEN Just Weeks After Rare 3I/ATLAS Flyby</h2>

<p>NASA has lost contact with its MAVEN spacecraft, a Mars orbiter, on 6 December 2023, shortly after it captured detailed observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as MAVEN, which has been in orbit around Mars since September 2014, plays a critical role in both atmospheric research and communications for other Mars missions. NASA has launched an investigation into the loss of signal and is working to re-establish contact with the spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>MAVEN lost contact on 6 December 2023.</li>
    <li>The spacecraft has been operational since September 2014.</li>
    <li>It played a key role in observing comet 3I/ATLAS in late September and early October 2023.</li>
    <li>MAVEN has completed over 22,000 orbits and contributed to over 700 peer-reviewed papers.</li>
    <li>NASA has not disclosed the specifics of the communication issue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late September and early October 2023, MAVEN successfully captured ultraviolet images of comet 3I/ATLAS, providing valuable scientific data. On 6 December 2023, MAVEN passed behind Mars and ground controllers lost contact after the spacecraft emerged from occultation.</p>
<p>Telemetry received prior to the loss indicated that all onboard systems were functioning normally. NASA's Deep Space Network has since been unable to detect any signal from MAVEN, prompting ongoing analysis by engineers and operations teams.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa has stressed that the loss of signal does not yet mean the spacecraft is permanently lost. Engineers and operations teams are analysing the situation and have not released details on whether the issue may involve power, orientation, or communications hardware.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>MAVEN is the first mission dedicated to studying Mars' upper atmosphere and its long-term evolution. The spacecraft has made significant contributions to understanding Mars' climatic history and atmospheric loss. Prior to the recent signal loss, MAVEN marked its 10th anniversary, underscoring its importance in ongoing Mars research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is continuing efforts to diagnose the loss of signal. The agency has stated that updates will be provided as more information becomes available regarding MAVEN's status and the ongoing investigation.</p>
