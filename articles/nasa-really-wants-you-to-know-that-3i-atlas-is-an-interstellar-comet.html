      <h2>NASA Confirms 3I/ATLAS as Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object, marking the third confirmed interstellar visitor since early July. The comet, detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, made its closest approach to the Sun in late October.</p>

<p>This announcement is significant as it provides insights into the nature of objects beyond our Solar System. NASA held a press conference to discuss the findings, emphasizing that 3I/ATLAS is a typical comet and not a spacecraft, as some have speculated.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: Late October 2023</li>
    <li>Detection: First spotted by ATLAS in early July 2023</li>
    <li>Eccentricity: Over six, indicating an extrasolar origin</li>
    <li>Size: Estimated to be a couple of kilometers across</li>
    <li>Data sources: Hubble Space Telescope, MAVEN mission, HiRISE camera</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by ATLAS in early July 2023. Its closest approach to the Sun occurred in late October during a government shutdown, which limited public communication from NASA. Following this, NASA held a press conference to present their findings about the comet.</p>
<p>The comet approached the inner Solar System in a nearly straight line and is now on a trajectory out of the Solar System. NASA utilized multiple missions, including Hubble and MAVEN, to gather data on 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object is a comet,” said Amit Kshatrya, NASA’s Associate Administrator. “It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The amount of material being released by 3I/ATLAS is fairly typical of Solar System comets,” said Tom Statler, lead scientist for Solar System bodies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third identified interstellar object, following previous visitors that have sparked curiosity about the nature of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System. NASA has set up systems for detecting Earth-threatening objects as part of its planetary defense program, which is aiding in the identification of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS and update its public webpage with new images and findings as they become available. Scientists have indicated that analysis is still in the early stages, and further refinements to their understanding of the comet may occur.</p>
