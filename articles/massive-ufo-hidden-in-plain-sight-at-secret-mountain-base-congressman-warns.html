      <h2>Massive UFO hidden in plain sight at secret mountain base, congressman warns</h2>

<p>A giant UFO may be concealed at a secret mountain base, according to claims made by U.S. Representative Eric Burlison (R-Missouri) on Monday. Burlison stated that the site is "guarded like it's some kind of commodity" and mentioned that former President Donald Trump is aware of "alien-human hybrids" already existing on Earth. The alleged UFO is reportedly located on the outskirts of Seoul, South Korea, and is surrounded by a building measuring approximately 270 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>This allegation raises questions about government transparency regarding extraterrestrial life. Authorities have not confirmed Burlison's claims, while a South Korean researcher has countered that the facility has no connection to aliens and has been in existence since the 1970s, according to reports.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rep. Eric Burlison made claims about a hidden UFO on October 23, 2023.</li>
    <li>The alleged site is located on the outskirts of Seoul, South Korea.</li>
    <li>The structure surrounding the UFO is approximately 270 feet in diameter.</li>
    <li>A South Korean researcher has stated the facility dates back to the 1970s.</li>
    <li>Former President Barack Obama has stated that aliens are real but dismissed conspiracy theories about Area 51.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 23, 2023, Rep. Eric Burlison publicly alleged the existence of a concealed UFO at a mountain base. He indicated that the site is heavily guarded and suggested that former President Trump has knowledge of alien-human hybrids. Following this, a South Korean researcher refuted the claims, asserting that the facility in question has been operational since the 1970s and has no ties to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>In a podcast released on October 21, 2023, former President Barack Obama confirmed the existence of aliens, stating, "They're real, but I haven't seen them." He also addressed conspiracy theories surrounding Area 51, clarifying that it is merely an air force facility and not a site for extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If I come under any hard evidence, whether it's physical or video evidence that is absolutely definitive, I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe,” Rep. Eric Burlison said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“They're not being kept in Area 51, there's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” former President Barack Obama stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a growing public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life, especially after recent government disclosures and former President Obama’s comments. The debate around Area 51 has persisted for decades, with many conspiracy theorists believing it houses alien technology and beings, despite official denials from government sources.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not announced any investigations or next steps regarding Burlison's claims. The situation remains fluid as more information may emerge in the coming days.</p>
