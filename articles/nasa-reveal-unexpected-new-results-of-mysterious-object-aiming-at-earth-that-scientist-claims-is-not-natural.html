      <h2>NASA reveals unexpected new results of mysterious object aiming at Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has reported new findings regarding the comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traveling toward Earth. The NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile first identified 3I/ATLAS in July 2023. It is only the third known object to originate from interstellar space, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. There have been no injuries or fatalities reported related to the comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it may provide insights into the composition and origin of interstellar objects. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun around Halloween 2023 before continuing into deep space. NASA and other organizations have clarified that 3I/ATLAS is a comet and not a potential threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was identified in July 2023 by a NASA-funded telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet measures approximately 11.2 kilometers wide.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of over 66 kilometers per second (41 miles per second).</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to the Sun is projected for Halloween 2023.</li>
    <li>Its coma is dominated by carbon dioxide, with a ratio of carbon dioxide to water of about 8 to 1.</li>
    <li>This ratio is one of the highest ever observed in any comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile identified the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Initial assessments classified it as a potential threat due to its high speed and unusual characteristics. Harvard physicist Avi Loeb suggested that the comet might not be natural, proposing it could be an alien mothership. However, NASA and other organizations later confirmed it is a comet, leading to further studies using the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<p>Following its identification, scientists began analyzing the light from 3I/ATLAS, which revealed its unique composition. The findings indicated an unusual prevalence of carbon dioxide in its coma, diverging from typical comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unusual mix could mean 3I/ATLAS has been loaded with carbon dioxide ice since its origin or that its water ice is buried too deep for sunlight to heat it up and release water vapor.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is an incredible opportunity for scientists to learn more about life outside our own cosmic neighborhood.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the largest interstellar object detected to date. Previous interstellar objects, Oumuamua and Borisov, have prompted significant interest in the study of materials from beyond our solar system. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS offer a rare chance to understand the conditions and processes that exist in other solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition. The data collected will contribute to ongoing research into interstellar objects and their implications for understanding the universe.</p>
