      <h2>The Acid Test of 3I/ATLAS at Perihelion</h2>

<p>On October 29, 2025, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest distance of 203 million kilometers from the Sun, marking a significant milestone in its journey through the Solar System. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This perihelion is crucial as it may determine the object's stability and trajectory. Researchers, including those from the Galileo Project, are monitoring 3I/ATLAS to assess its behavior and potential threats. The event raises questions about the object's nature and whether it could pose risks to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 203 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Venus:</strong> November 3, 2025, at 97 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 267 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 16, 2026, at 54 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> ESA, Juno spacecraft</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS will complete half of its journey through the Solar System on October 29, 2025. This perihelion event allows for optimal gravitational assist for any potential maneuvers.</p>
<p>Following this, the object will come within 97 million kilometers of Venus on November 3, 2025. It will be observable by the ESA mission Juice during its path to Jupiter.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2025, it will reach a distance of 267 million kilometers from Earth. Finally, on March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS will arrive at its closest distance of 54 million kilometers from Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fundamental question is whether 3I/ATLAS is a Trojan Horse with the external appearance of a natural comet but carrying a potential threat in its interior,” said Avi Loeb, co-author of a relevant White Paper.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This perihelion is seen as an "acid test" for 3I/ATLAS. If the object is a natural comet, it may break apart due to heating. If it is technologically manufactured, it could present unforeseen challenges.</p>
<p>The Galileo Project is actively studying 3I/ATLAS to determine if any unusual activity occurs based on data collected from its observatories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS for unusual activity in the months leading up to its closest approaches. Investigations will focus on its trajectory and any potential threats it may pose to Earth or other celestial bodies.</p>
