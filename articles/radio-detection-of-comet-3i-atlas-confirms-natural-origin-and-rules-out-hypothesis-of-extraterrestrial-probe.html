      <h2>Radio detection of comet 3I/ATLAS confirms natural origin and rules out hypothesis of extraterrestrial probe</h2>

<p>Astronomers at the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa have detected radio emissions from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS for the first time on October 24, 2025. Discovered in July by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, the comet crosses the Solar System on a hyperbolic trajectory and is the third confirmed interstellar visitor after 'Oumuamua and Borisov. The observation confirms the release of hydroxyl (OH) molecules due to solar heating and rules out speculation regarding artificial origins.</p>

<p>This detection is significant as it enhances the understanding of cometary activity and the composition of interstellar objects. Authorities, including the European Space Agency, have planned additional observations to analyze the comet's characteristics further.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of radio emission detection: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovery date of 3I/ATLAS: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached: October 29, 2025, at approximately 210 million kilometers from the Sun</li>
    <li>Comet's nucleus diameter: 9.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated mass: 50 billion tons</li>
    <li>Expected distance from Earth in December: 327 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Observations by JUICE probe: Scheduled between December 2 and 25, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was identified by the ATLAS system in Chile. Initially classified as an asteroid, its interstellar nature was confirmed due to its high speed of 209,000 km/h. Astronomers around the globe, including those using the Hubble and James Webb telescopes, began monitoring the comet.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected radio emissions from the comet, confirming the presence of hydroxyl molecules. Perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, when the comet was temporarily obscured by solar radiation.</p>
<p>Further observations are planned for December 2025, as the comet moves away from the Sun and approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of hydroxyl confirms that 3I/ATLAS follows patterns of cometary activity, eliminating speculation about artificial origins,” said a representative from the MeerKAT team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its unique characteristics, including a composition rich in carbon dioxide and hydrogen cyanide, which differs from local comets. Previous interstellar visitors, such as 'Oumuamua, did not exhibit a coma, while 3I/ATLAS shows significant activity, with brightness exceeding expectations for similar objects.</p>
<p>The comet's unusual size has prompted some researchers to question its origins. However, spectral data confirms chemical patterns consistent with formation in a distant protoplanetary disk.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations will continue with the JUICE probe's observations scheduled for December 2025. These missions aim to further analyze the comet's composition and track its exit from the Solar System.</p>
