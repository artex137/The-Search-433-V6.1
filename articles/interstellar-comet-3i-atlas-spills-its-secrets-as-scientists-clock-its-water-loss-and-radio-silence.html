      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS spills its secrets as scientists clock its water loss and radio silence</h2>

<p>Scientists have measured water streaming from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS following its closest approach to the Sun on December 27, 2025. The findings, released on January 2, 2026, in a report using data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), highlight the comet's significant water loss and lack of detectable radio signals.</p>

<p>This research is crucial as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed object from interstellar space to enter the solar system. NASA has stated that the comet is on a hyperbolic trajectory, which means it will not return. The agency has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth, maintaining a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units (AU) at its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on December 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>Peak water production rate was estimated at 3.17×10<sup>29</sup> molecules per second.</li>
    <li>Water production dropped to about 1–2×10<sup>28</sup> molecules per second by December 8, 2025.</li>
    <li>SOHO's SWAN instrument began observing the comet on November 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently about 1.8 AU from Earth.</li>
    <li>Breakthrough Listen program reported no credible narrowband radio signals from the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS's brightness was around magnitude +15.6 on January 1, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 6, 2025, SOHO's SWAN instrument began tracking the hydrogen coma of 3I/ATLAS. This observation occurred nine days after the comet's closest point to the Sun.</p>
<p>The peak water production rate was recorded shortly after perihelion, followed by a decline in water output as the comet moved away from the Sun. By December 8, the water production had significantly decreased.</p>
<p>On January 1, 2026, the Breakthrough Listen program reported that it had found no evidence of narrowband radio technosignatures originating from 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We find no credible detections of narrowband radio technosignatures originating from 3I/ATLAS,” said lead author Ben Jacobson-Bell, as reported by space journalist Leonard David.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is among a small number of interstellar objects that provide scientists with unique insights into material formed around other stars. The comet's high profile has spurred discussions about the need for a coordinated strategy for studying such rare interstellar arrivals as detection rates increase.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it recedes from the Sun, comparing its behavior to comets formed within the solar system. Further observations may help enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>
