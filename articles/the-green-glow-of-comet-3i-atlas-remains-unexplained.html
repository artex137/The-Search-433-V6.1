      <h2>The green glow of comet 3I/ATLAS remains unexplained</h2>

<p>Astrophotographers Gerald Rhemann and Michael Jäger have captured unique photographs of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during the total lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025, revealing an unexpected green glow that has puzzled scientists.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it challenges existing knowledge about the chemical composition of the comet. Researchers are working to understand the source of the green glow, as previous studies have shown that 3I/ATLAS has an unusual chemical make-up that does not include the typical dicarbon (C2) molecules responsible for such a phenomenon in other comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of observation:</strong> September 7, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Photographers:</strong> Gerald Rhemann and Michael Jäger</li>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Expected closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Unusual chemical findings:</strong> Elevated levels of carbon dioxide, traces of nickel and cyanogen, no dicarbon detected</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 7, 2025, Rhemann and Jäger photographed comet 3I/ATLAS during a total lunar eclipse. Their images revealed a green glow, prompting further investigation into its chemical composition. Prior studies, including those conducted with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), indicated that the comet contains unusual levels of carbon dioxide and other compounds, but lacks the dicarbon typically associated with a green hue.</p>

<p>Astronomer Luis Salazar Manzano from the University of Michigan has noted that 3I/ATLAS exhibits significant “carbon chain depletion,” suggesting it has fewer C2 and C3 molecules than other known comets. This anomaly raises questions about the potential presence of other unknown molecules contributing to the observed green glow.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Either dicarbon is present but has not yet been detected due to unique conditions, or some other, as yet unknown molecule is responsible for the green glow,” said Luis Salazar Manzano.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The green glow of comets is typically attributed to the presence of dicarbon (C2), which forms when solar heat sublimates ice into gas. However, the unusual findings regarding 3I/ATLAS challenge this understanding and suggest a need for further research into the chemical processes of interstellar comets. Previous reports have also speculated about the potential for 3I/ATLAS to impact Mars, highlighting its significance in astronomical studies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to conduct detailed observations of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December 2025, hoping to uncover the mystery behind its green glow and expand knowledge about celestial bodies from beyond our Solar System.</p>
