      <h2>Harvard Professor Avi Loeb Warns 3I/ATLAS Could Be a Rare 'Black Swan' or a Trojan Horse in Space</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb has warned that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may not be the benign comet scientists initially believed, but could instead represent a rare 'Black Swan' event or a Trojan Horse with significant implications for Earth and humanity. Loeb has called for a broader investigation into 3I/ATLAS's unusual behaviours and characteristics since its detection on 1 July 2025.</p>

<p>This matter has raised concerns within the scientific community, prompting calls for further scrutiny of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in early 2026. Authorities have begun to reassess the object’s characteristics and behaviour, challenging conventional interpretations and considering the possibility of an artificial origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was detected on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>The object has a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not bound to the Sun.</li>
    <li>It is only the third interstellar object ever observed, following 1I/&#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Loeb has emphasized the need for continued observation as 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter in early 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA and mainstream astronomers assert that 3I/ATLAS shows typical cometary features.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025. Since then, Professor Loeb has raised concerns about its unusual features and has called for a deeper investigation into its characteristics. He has pointed out anomalies that he believes warrant a closer examination beyond standard comet models. The object is expected to pass near Jupiter in early 2026, providing an opportunity for further observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The CIA's ambiguous reply suggests that some officials may view the discovery through the lens of low-probability, high-impact risks, the very definition of a Black Swan occurrence,” Loeb stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb has criticized the communication strategy of space agencies for downplaying the mysteries associated with 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior discussions in the scientific community have largely supported the view that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, based on observations of water vapour and carbon dioxide emissions. Critics of Loeb's theories argue that claimed anomalies may result from limited data quality rather than indicate novel physics or engineering.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, further observations are anticipated to provide crucial data that could either support mainstream scientific interpretations or deepen the ongoing debate regarding the object’s origins and implications.</p>
