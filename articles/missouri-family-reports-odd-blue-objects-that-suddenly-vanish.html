      <h2>Missouri Family Reports Odd Blue Objects That Suddenly Vanish</h2>

<p>A family in Saint Joseph, Missouri, reported seeing three glowing blue objects that suddenly disappeared on November 22, 2025, at 6:39 p.m. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this incident.</p>

<p>This sighting matters as it adds to a growing list of unexplained aerial phenomena in the area. The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) has received the family's account, prompting interest from both local residents and UFO enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date: November 22, 2025</li>
<li>Time: 6:39 p.m.</li>
<li>Location: Saint Joseph, Missouri</li>
<li>Number of witnesses: not disclosed</li>
<li>Objects: Three glowing whitish-blue objects</li>
<li>Size estimate: As large as a football field</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The family observed the objects from their porch in the early evening. They reported seeing the three objects in a triangle formation at a high altitude. The objects then appeared to lower before vanishing completely.</p>

<p>According to the eyewitness testimony collected by NUFORC, the objects were described as massive, with a haze around each one. The family noted the unusual colour and size, which they felt did not match typical aircraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Looked up from our porch and saw three glowing whitish blue objects very high altitude in triangle formation. They were in a triangle formation and lowering then just disappeared and never came back,” the family stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“They appeared to be massive possibly being as large as a football field,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
