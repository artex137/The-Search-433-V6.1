      <h2>3I/ATLAS orbital anomaly intrigues astronomers with precision in Jupiter and interstellar origin</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile, is set to pass 53.445 million kilometers from Jupiter on March 16, 2026. This trajectory coincides with the planet's Hill radius, a region of gravitational influence, posing a one in 26,000 chance of a random event, according to NASA astronomers.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it allows for the study of gravitational interactions without the risk of collision, given that the comet will travel at more than 60 km/s. NASA has coordinated observations with various telescopes and probes to analyze the comet's chemical composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Jupiter at closest approach: 53.445 million km</li>
    <li>Speed: More than 60 km/s</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: Up to 11 km</li>
    <li>Composition: Rich in cyanide and nickel vapor</li>
    <li>Next significant date: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>NASA mobilized 20 imaging missions for observation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2025, the Zwicky Transient Facility of Caltech initially identified 3I/ATLAS. The comet's activity was confirmed by telescopes, including the Nordic Optical Telescope, on July 2, 2025. Subsequent observations revealed a diffuse coma and a tail elongation of 3 arc seconds.</p>

<p>By August, the Very Large Telescope detected the comet's chemical composition, confirming a high level of carbon dioxide with a ratio of 8:1 compared to water. Notably, the comet displayed a non-illusory solar jet, extending over a million kilometers during multiple months in 2025.</p>

<p>On October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion at 1.4 AU from the Sun, recording non-gravitational acceleration, which adjusted its trajectory. The European Space Agency's Juice probe passed 64 million kilometers from the comet on November 4, 2025, collecting crucial data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The proximity to Jupiter will allow us to gather unprecedented data on the comet's interactions with the planet's gravity,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This comet challenges existing models of interstellar objects, and we look forward to analyzing the data collected during its approach,” noted Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist involved in the project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I designation of 3I/ATLAS marks it as the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit and unique chemical composition have raised questions about its origin, suggesting it formed in a carbon-rich protoplanetary disk, potentially over seven billion years ago.</p>

<p>Recent studies have indicated a growing interest in interstellar objects as they may provide insights into the early solar system and its formation processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Juno probe will observe the comet from March 9 to March 22, 2026, potentially detecting new orbital objects. Observations will focus on gaseous emissions and dust, enhancing understanding of planetary formation as 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system.</p>
