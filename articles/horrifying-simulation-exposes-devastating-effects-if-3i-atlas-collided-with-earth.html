      <h2>Horrifying simulation exposes devastating effects if 3I/ATLAS collided with Earth</h2>

<p>A simulation has revealed the catastrophic consequences of a potential collision between the comet 3I/ATLAS and Earth. The simulation estimates that if the comet were to strike Washington D.C., approximately 1.2 million people could be vaporized instantly, with a further 19.3 million expected to die from the resulting fireball. The simulation was conducted ahead of the comet's closest approach to Earth on November 18, 2023.</p>

<p>This simulation matters as it highlights the potential risks posed by celestial bodies, even when current scientific assessments indicate that 3I/ATLAS will not collide with Earth. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has identified the comet's trajectory, confirming it will pass safely behind the Sun, alleviating fears of an imminent impact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between 440 and 5,600 meters in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at approximately 221,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>If it struck Washington D.C. at a 45-degree angle, it would create an impact radius of 27 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The resulting crater would extend around 792 meters into the ground.</li>
    <li>1.2 million people could be vaporized instantly in the impact.</li>
    <li>19.3 million people could perish from the fireball generated by the collision.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has monitored 3I/ATLAS for several months, confirming its trajectory. As the comet approaches its closest point to Earth on November 18, 2023, scientists have conducted simulations to assess the potential impact of a collision.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, concerns arose regarding another asteroid, 2024 YR4, which had a brief possibility of hitting Earth, but those fears were ultimately alleviated. The recent simulation of 3I/ATLAS serves as a reminder of the ongoing need to study and prepare for potential threats from space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The simulation shows the devastating impact a comet could have, but it’s important to note that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This simulation follows a trend of increasing public interest in near-Earth objects and their potential hazards. Past incidents, such as the Chelyabinsk meteor in 2013, have underscored the importance of monitoring and understanding the risks associated with such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and other near-Earth objects to ensure public safety and preparedness against potential impacts.</p>
