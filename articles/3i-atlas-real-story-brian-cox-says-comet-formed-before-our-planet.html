      <h2>3I/ATLAS Real Story: Brian Cox Says Comet Formed Before Our Planet</h2>

<p>Professor Brian Cox has addressed speculation about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS during a recent episode of the StarTalk podcast, asserting that the comet formed long before Earth. He emphasized that claims of extraterrestrial origins are unfounded and detract from its scientific significance.</p>

<p>Cox's remarks highlight the importance of understanding 3I/ATLAS as a natural phenomenon rather than a potential alien probe. He stated that the comet offers an unprecedented opportunity to study material that has traveled for billions of years, providing insights into the early universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet with an estimated age of 7 to 8 billion years.</li>
    <li>The comet is composed of carbon dioxide, water ices, and other materials.</li>
    <li>It will pass Earth at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units (168 million miles or 270 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>NASA supports Cox’s view that the object poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Cox has publicly discussed the comet's origins since October 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard physicist, has suggested keeping an open mind about the object's behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 as an interstellar object passing through the Solar System. Since then, it has sparked various theories regarding its origin, particularly claims of it being an alien spacecraft. Cox has consistently rebutted these theories, pointing out the comet's natural characteristics.</p>
<p>In October 2025, Cox began publicly discussing the comet's origins and its significance in relation to the early universe. His remarks have aimed to clarify the scientific narrative surrounding 3I/ATLAS and to combat misinformation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The reality of it that this is something that formed before the Earth formed and visiting our solar system and going back into interstellar space is more interesting than trying to say that it's some kind of completely useless [aliens],” said Cox during the podcast.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “By the way, if it's an alien spaceship, it's not spending much time [here],” Cox joked, referring to the comet’s trajectory.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS has drawn attention to the broader discussion about interstellar objects and their implications for understanding the universe. While some scientists, like Avi Loeb, advocate for a more open perspective on unusual celestial phenomena, others, including Cox, stress the importance of grounding theories in established scientific evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the Solar System, astronomers will monitor its trajectory. Cox remains confident that the comet will not return, offering a fleeting glimpse at an ancient traveler before it exits into interstellar space.</p>
