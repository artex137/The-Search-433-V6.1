      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Interstellar comet before closest approach to Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to pass its closest point to Earth this week, reaching a distance of 270 million kilometers on Friday. Discovered in early July by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar visitor to our solar system.</p>

<p>This event matters to astronomers because it provides an opportunity for enhanced observation of the comet using advanced instruments. The best conditions for observing 3I/ATLAS will occur as it approaches Earth, allowing for detailed studies of its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: Friday, at 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Discovery date: Early July by ATLAS in Chile.</li>
    <li>Visible from Earth: Since early November.</li>
    <li>Notable instruments used: Hubble Space Telescope, XMM-Newton space telescope.</li>
    <li>Ongoing observation campaign: International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023 by ATLAS in Chile. It became visible from Earth again in early November after being obscured by the sun in the autumn. On November 30, Hubble captured an image of the comet from 286 million kilometers away. The European Space Agency published an image of 3I/ATLAS in the X-ray spectrum shortly after, highlighting its interaction with solar wind.</p>
<p>Since the end of November, the IAWN has initiated an astrometry campaign to determine the comet's orbital data, which is expected to continue until the end of January 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The apparently noisy image is of great value for research because the instrument can detect and study gases that are difficult to identify with other devices,” said a representative from the European Space Agency regarding the X-ray observations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar object discovered during its passage through the solar system. Such comets offer unique insights into the composition and dynamics of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will continue its observations until the end of January 2024, after which the most effective methods for determining orbital data will be discussed to enhance future planetary defense measures.</p>
