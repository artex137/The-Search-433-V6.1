      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-04 13:13 UTC</p>

      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS rocketing through solar system at 61 km per second poses no threat to Earth: NASA</h2>

<p>The rare Comet 3I/ATLAS is travelling through the solar system at a speed of 61 kilometers per second, but it poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA. The comet was first discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to be identified from outside our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua’ in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA has confirmed that the comet will remain far away from Earth as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is travelling at 61 km/s (137,000 mph).</li>
    <li>It was discovered on July 1, 2025, in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun around October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will approach within 210 million kilometers of the Sun, just inside the orbit of Mars.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will be about 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Nasa is tracking the comet using Hubble, Webb, and SPHEREx telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. NASA has since monitored its trajectory through various space telescopes. As of October 4, 2025, the agency has confirmed that the comet poses no danger to Earth.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun around October 30, 2025, and will pass behind the Sun later that month. It is projected to venture past Jupiter in March 2026 before leaving the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away. The closest it will approach our planet is about 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles, or 270 million kilometers),” NASA said.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Although the trajectory of the object brings it into the inner solar system; it won’t come close to Earth,” the agency added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is a rare interstellar object, marking the third instance of such a discovery. The previous interstellar objects, ‘Oumuamua’ and 2I/Borisov, have been subjects of extensive study since their identification.</p>
<p>The study of interstellar comets provides insight into the formation and evolution of solar systems, as well as the potential for future exploration of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to track Comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, ensuring that any updates regarding its trajectory are communicated to the public.</p>
