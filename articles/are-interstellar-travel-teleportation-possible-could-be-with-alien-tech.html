      <h2>Are Interstellar Travel, Teleportation Possible? Could Be With Alien Tech</h2>

<p>A new government-backed documentary titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> has claimed that alien technology could soon enable interstellar travel and teleportation. The film, directed by Dan Farah, is set to premiere on 21 November 2025 in select cinemas in New York, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., before a worldwide release on Prime Video.</p>

<p>The documentary comes at a time of increased public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena, following congressional hearings in September where officials called for transparency regarding possible extraterrestrial evidence. Farah has described the film as "the most credible and serious documentary ever made on this topic," focusing on how recovered alien technology could advance humanity’s capabilities in space exploration and transportation.</p>
