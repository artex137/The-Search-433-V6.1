      <h2>SwRI Researchers Use PUNCH To Track Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) project has utilized data from NASA’s Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) spacecraft to track the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The tracking occurred over several weeks when the comet was obscured by the Sun as viewed from Earth, making it difficult for other telescopes to observe.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it provides unique insights into the comet's behaviour and characteristics during its passage through the solar system. PUNCH, which launched in March 2025, is a constellation of four small spacecraft designed to image the solar corona and solar wind. SwRI researchers have adapted the mission to also monitor 3I/ATLAS, enhancing understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>PUNCH launched in March 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third officially recognized interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>PUNCH collects approximately one image per minute of the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet was unobservable for several weeks except by PUNCH.</li>
    <li>Dr. Craig DeForest leads the PUNCH mission at SwRI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, SwRI researchers Dr. Kevin Walsh and Dr. Simon Porter initiated a project to use publicly available PUNCH data to search for undiscovered asteroids. Soon after, 3I/ATLAS was detected entering the solar system.</p>
<p>Researchers noted that the comet would remain in the PUNCH field of view for nearly two months. During this time, the comet was behind the Sun from Earth’s perspective, limiting visibility from other telescopes.</p>
<p>Throughout October, PUNCH provided continuous imaging of 3I/ATLAS, allowing researchers to observe the comet's tail and its interaction with solar wind.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“PUNCH is a wide-field imager, not a telescope: our spatial resolution is about the same as a human’s eyesight, but far more sensitive than the human eye,” said Dr. Craig DeForest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Nothing else could monitor the comet for a time except for PUNCH,” Dr. Kevin Walsh stated. “And the community is desperate to know every little thing this comet does.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The PUNCH mission is unique because it is designed to observe the Sun and its immediate surroundings, a capability that sets it apart from other space telescopes. Most telescopes avoid looking at the Sun due to the risk of damaging their instruments.</p>
<p>This research may contribute to a better understanding of comets and interstellar objects, which have been of increasing interest to the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected by PUNCH to gain further insights into 3I/ATLAS and its properties as it travels through the solar system.</p>
