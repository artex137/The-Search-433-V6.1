      <h2>South African Telescope Detects Natural Radio Emission from Interstellar Visitor 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A team of international researchers has detected natural radio emissions from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. The observations took place between September and November 2025, confirming that the comet is behaving like a typical comet and not emitting signals of technological origin.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known object of interstellar origin to pass through the Solar System. The detection of hydroxyl emissions adds to our understanding of the comet's composition and behaviour, according to the researchers. The team is continuing to analyze data to deepen insights into this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> More than 350 million kilometers from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Observations conducted:</strong> 20 September, 28 September, 4 November, 6 November, 11-12 November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Lead institutions:</strong> University of Cape Town, South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, Rhodes University, KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden)</li>
    <li><strong>Detection of hydroxyl emissions:</strong> Confirmed on 24 October and subsequent dates</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Following its discovery, an international team began observing the comet using the MeerKAT telescope. Initial observations on 20 and 28 September 2025 yielded no hydroxyl emissions, although a hydroxyl maser from a Mira-type variable star was detected.</p>

<p>On 24 October 2025, researchers detected hydroxyl absorption from 3I/ATLAS. This was followed by additional absorption detections on 4 and 6 November, and finally, emission was observed on 11-12 November. Throughout this period, the Breakthrough Listen team analyzed data for any signs of technological signals, confirming none were detected.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Detecting the hydroxyl signal is an important confirmation that 3I/ATLAS is behaving like a comet,” said Professor Mykola Ivchenko from KTH Sweden.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We’re happy that we are contributing, alongside colleagues around the world, to a fuller understanding of this remarkable natural phenomenon – a comet likely formed in another stellar system that is briefly passing through our own,” stated SARAO chief scientist Fernando Camilo.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third known interstellar object to visit the Solar System. Its detection and study contribute to the growing body of knowledge about such objects and their behaviours. The observations made by MeerKAT are part of ongoing efforts to understand the nature of interstellar comets and the potential for detecting signals from extraterrestrial civilizations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research team will continue analyzing data from the MeerKAT observations to further understand 3I/ATLAS and its characteristics. Future observations may provide additional insights into the comet's behaviour as it moves through the Solar System.</p>
