      <h2>New Amazon UFO Doc Claims George HW Bush Told Wild Alien Encounter Story</h2>

<p>A new documentary titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> has premiered on Amazon Prime, featuring an alleged extraterrestrial encounter story involving former President George HW Bush. The film, directed by Dan Farah, includes insights from Eric Davis, an astrophysicist and former scientific advisor for the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which was initiated in 2007 and later disbanded.</p>

<p>This documentary is significant as it brings attention to the ongoing public interest in UFOs and the government's historical interactions with unidentified aerial phenomena. The claims made in the film have prompted renewed discussions about the credibility of UFO sightings and the secrecy surrounding military encounters with potential extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary released on Amazon Prime this week.</li>
    <li>Director: Dan Farah.</li>
    <li>Features interview with Eric Davis, astrophysicist and former AATIP advisor.</li>
    <li>Incident reportedly occurred at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, in 1964.</li>
    <li>George HW Bush learned of the incident after leaving office in 1993.</li>
    <li>Davis claims Bush shared the story with him in 2003.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1964, three spaceships reportedly approached Holloman Air Force Base in Otero County, New Mexico. One of the crafts allegedly landed, and a non-human entity is said to have interacted with military and CIA personnel at the base. George HW Bush, who was not present during this incident, did not learn about it until after his presidency in early 1993. Eric Davis claims Bush recounted the story to him in 2003.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“One of them landed on the tarmac and a non-human entity deboarded the craft that landed and interacted with uniformed Air Force and civilian CIA personnel,” said Eric Davis.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The AATIP was established to investigate reports of unidentified aerial phenomena and assess their potential threat to national security. This documentary adds to a growing body of work examining the historical and contemporary implications of UFO sightings and the government's role in understanding them.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UFOs continues to rise, further investigations into historical incidents and government disclosures are expected. The release of <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> may encourage additional discussions and inquiries into the credibility of such claims.</p>
