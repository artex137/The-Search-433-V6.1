      <h2>What is 3I/ATLAS, a comet that created international alert</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has become the focus of worldwide astronomical observations since its discovery by a research telescope in northern Chile in July 2023. The comet has drawn significant attention due to its unique chemical composition and hyperbolic trajectory, indicating that it is not bound to the solar system and does not follow a closed orbit. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for the scientific community as it marks the third known interstellar object to be identified. Authorities, including the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), have announced a special training exercise to enhance the accuracy of the comet's orbital measurements. The exercise will take place from November 27, 2023, to January 27, 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first reported in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is approximately 670 million kilometers from the Sun and within the orbit of Jupiter.</li>
    <li>The comet moves at a speed of 221,000 kilometers per hour (61 km/s).</li>
    <li>The special training exercise by IAWN runs from November 27, 2023, to January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following “Oumuamua” in 2017 and “2I/Borisov” in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by a telescope in northern Chile. Subsequent observations revealed its unique properties and trajectory. The IAWN has since planned a special training exercise to improve orbital measurements of the comet, scheduled for late November 2023 through January 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Although it does not pose any threat, comet 3I/ATLAS represents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to carry out an observation exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and the high interest of the scientific community,”</blockquote>
<p>the IAWN stated in an official note.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the identification of two previous interstellar objects, “Oumuamua” in 2017 and “2I/Borisov” in 2019. These discoveries have increased interest in studying celestial bodies that originate from outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will conduct the planned training exercise to refine the comet's orbital measurements and enhance observational capabilities over the next few years.</p>
