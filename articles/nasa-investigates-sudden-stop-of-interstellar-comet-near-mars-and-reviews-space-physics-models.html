      <h2>NASA investigates sudden stop of interstellar comet near Mars and reviews space physics models</h2>

<p>The global scientific community is investigating an unprecedented event involving the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which completely halted its movement near Mars in October 2025. This phenomenon occurred approximately 27 million kilometers from the red planet and has raised questions about the forces acting in the interplanetary vacuum.</p>

<p>This incident is significant because it challenges established concepts of celestial mechanics. NASA teams have undertaken rigorous checks to validate the event and have been analyzing data from various observatories and space probes. The focus is on identifying the nature of the forces that caused the comet to stop, which has sparked intense debate among scientists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas detected in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Event occurred 27 million kilometers from Mars.</li>
    <li>Comet halted for several days before resuming its trajectory.</li>
    <li>Incident recorded by multiple observatories and probes, including Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>Comet's size estimated between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>Comet's age estimated at approximately 10 billion years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, the comet 3I/Atlas was observed traveling through the Solar System. During its approach to Mars, it unexpectedly stopped moving for several days, defying the principles of conservation of energy and linear momentum. After this period of immobility, the comet resumed its trajectory and reached perihelion by the end of the month.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The event has prompted a critical update to the orbital simulation software used by space agencies,” said a NASA representative. “We must now include variables for high-power non-gravitational interactions in our trajectory calculations.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/Atlas is unprecedented in astronomical observation, as celestial bodies typically gain speed or maintain momentum when escaping solar attraction. This incident has led to a reevaluation of existing theories in celestial mechanics and has implications for planetary defense systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations will focus on identifying the unknown forces that caused the comet to stop. Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected during the event, which promises to enhance understanding of interstellar physics and the conditions in other planetary systems.</p>
