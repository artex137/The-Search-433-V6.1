      <h2>Data From Mars Lets ESA Predict 3I/ATLAS’s Path 10 Times More Precisely</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has used images from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter to refine the orbit of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on July 1. The comet was hidden from earthly observers by the Sun during this period, with no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This advancement is significant as it improves predictions for potential collision courses with Earth. ESA officials have stated that the refined calculations could enhance our understanding of 3I/ATLAS and other celestial objects, making it easier to track their paths.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1.</li>
    <li>ESA refined its trajectory calculations between October 1 and 7.</li>
    <li>The comet is located approximately 29 million kilometers (17 million miles) from Earth.</li>
    <li>The uncertainty in the comet's trajectory has been reduced by a factor of 10.</li>
    <li>Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) has been observing 3I/ATLAS since November 2.</li>
    <li>JUICE will continue observations until November 25.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1. Following its discovery, astronomers faced challenges in tracking its position due to its small size and rapid movement. ESA's ExoMars TGO performed observations from October 1 to 7, allowing for refined calculations of the comet’s orbit. JUICE began its observations on November 2 and will continue until November 25, providing additional data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target,” said Nick Thomas of ESA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this, astronomers struggled to calculate the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS due to its unpredictable path influenced by gas emissions. The use of spacecraft like ExoMars TGO represents a novel approach to tracking such distant objects, as traditional methods rely heavily on terrestrial observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA plans to utilize data from JUICE to further refine the orbit of 3I/ATLAS. The agency is also developing the NEOMIR mission to address potential threats from asteroids approaching Earth from the direction of the Sun, aiming to provide advance warnings of significant threats.</p>
