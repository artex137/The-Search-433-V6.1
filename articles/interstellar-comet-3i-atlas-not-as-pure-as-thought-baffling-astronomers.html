      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS 'Not As Pure As Thought,' Baffling Astronomers</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) has arrived in the solar system, revealing unexpected characteristics that have left astronomers puzzled. The comet, which is estimated to be around 7 billion years old, has shown signs of extensive damage from cosmic radiation during its long journey through space.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for the scientific community as it challenges previous assumptions about interstellar comets. Astronomers have begun to reassess what these celestial bodies can teach us about the conditions in interstellar space and the formation of solar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>Initial observations were made on 10 November 2025 by Italy's Virtual Telescope Project.</li>
    <li>The comet has been altered by exposure to cosmic radiation, forming a crust up to 20 metres deep.</li>
    <li>The James Webb Space Telescope provided data revealing a high CO2-to-water ratio.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 10 November 2025, astronomers with Italy's Virtual Telescope Project captured images of 3I/ATLAS. They combined fourteen long-exposure shots to reveal the comet's faint, ghostly light against the backdrop of a bright moon.</p>

<p>Subsequent analysis using data from the James Webb Space Telescope indicated that the comet's surface has been significantly altered due to cosmic radiation damage. This led to the discovery of a thick irradiated crust and a puzzling CO2-to-water ratio.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The scars it carries tell us about the 'empty' space between the stars,” said an astronomer involved in the study. “This discovery represents a 'paradigm shift' for astronomers.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the body of research on interstellar objects, which has gained momentum following the detection of the first known interstellar object, 'Oumuamua, in 2017. Scientists have been eager to study these celestial visitors to gain insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to understand its altered surface and the implications for our knowledge of interstellar space. Further observations and analyses are expected to reveal more about the comet's history and the conditions in the void between stars.</p>
