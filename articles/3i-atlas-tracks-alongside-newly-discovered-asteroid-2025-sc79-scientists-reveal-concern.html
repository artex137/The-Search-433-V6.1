      <h2>3I/ATLAS Tracks Alongside Newly Discovered Asteroid 2025 SC79—Scientists Reveal Concern</h2>

<p>Carnegie Science has announced the discovery of a new asteroid, 2025 SC79, which was spotted on 27 September 2023, while hidden in the glare of the Sun. The asteroid measures approximately 0.4 miles (700 metres) long and orbits the Sun in just 128 days. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant for planetary defense, as astronomers emphasize the importance of detecting asteroids that may pose impact hazards. According to Carnegie astronomer Scott Sheppard, the most dangerous asteroids are often the hardest to detect. He stated that these "twilight" asteroids can only be observed during specific times when the Sun is rising or setting, making them a challenge for researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Astronomer Scott Sheppard discovered 2025 SC79 on 27 September 2023.</li>
    <li>The asteroid orbits the Sun every 128 days.</li>
    <li>2025 SC79 is approximately 0.4 miles (700 metres) long.</li>
    <li>The discovery was confirmed by NSF's Gemini Observatory and Carnegie Science's Magellan Telescopes.</li>
    <li>Details of the discovery were shared with the astronomy community on 15 October 2023.</li>
    <li>Future observations will be delayed as the asteroid is currently behind the Sun from Earth’s perspective.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 27 September 2023, Scott Sheppard discovered asteroid 2025 SC79 while conducting research to locate hidden asteroids near the Sun. The asteroid's existence was confirmed by multiple observatories, and news of the find was disseminated to the astronomy community on 15 October 2023.</p>
<p>Following its discovery, the asteroid will be closely monitored, although further observations will be postponed as it is now obscured by the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The most dangerous asteroids are the most difficult to detect,” said Scott Sheppard. “Asteroids that lurk near the sun can only be observed during twilight.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Carnegie officials stated, “Future research of this object will reveal details about its composition—and how it survives the intense heat of its proximity to the Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Sheppard and his team are recognized for their expertise in discovering asteroids in challenging conditions. They previously identified the fastest-known asteroid, 2021 PH27, which has an orbital period of just 113 days. The ongoing research is supported by NASA and employs advanced telescopes to enhance detection capabilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations of 2025 SC79 are expected to provide insights into its composition and origin, with plans for follow-up research once it is visible again from Earth. NASA and a network of telescopes will continue monitoring for potentially hazardous asteroids as part of their ongoing planetary defense efforts.</p>
