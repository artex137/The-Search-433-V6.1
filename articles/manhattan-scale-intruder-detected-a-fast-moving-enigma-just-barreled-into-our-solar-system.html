      <h2>Manhattan-scale intruder detected — A fast-moving enigma just barreled into our Solar System</h2>

<p>A Manhattan-scale comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, is currently traveling through our solar system and is expected to pass close to Mars in early October 2023. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this cosmic event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it could provide unprecedented insights into the nature of interstellar objects. NASA and other space agencies are preparing to observe 3I/ATLAS closely, with instruments capable of capturing detailed images and data about its composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately 5 kilometers across</li>
    <li>Mass: Roughly 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Distance from Sun: Ranges from 3.14 to 2.14 AU</li>
    <li>Close approach to Mars: Expected in early October 2023</li>
    <li>NASA instruments involved: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, ESA’s Mars Express, and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter</li>
    <li>Previous observations: Hubble imaged the comet at 570 million kilometers away in late July 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been tracked as it approached our solar system. Its distance from the Sun has fluctuated between 3.14 and 2.14 AU. Observations taken by an international team using the UVES spectrograph on Chile’s Very Large Telescope revealed an unusual composition, showing a high nickel-to-iron ratio.</p>

<p>In late July 2023, Hubble provided the first images of 3I/ATLAS. As it nears Mars, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and other spacecraft will capture more detailed images, with a resolution of about 30 kilometers per pixel.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This intruder is producing nickel at a rate far beyond any comet we know,” said K. Meech from the International Gemini Observatory. “The discovery is extremely puzzling and has raised new questions about the nature of such cosmic objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The size and mass of 3I/ATLAS are significantly larger than its predecessors, highlighting the diversity of interstellar visitors. The presence of nickel and iron in its gas plume is unusual, as these metals typically do not vaporize in the cold temperatures of comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, NASA and ESA will conduct close observations to gather data that may clarify its composition and origin. The upcoming images will be crucial in understanding this enigmatic object and could lead to further studies about interstellar objects in our solar system.</p>
