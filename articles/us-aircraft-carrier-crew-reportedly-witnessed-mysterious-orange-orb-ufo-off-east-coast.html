      <h2>US Aircraft Carrier Crew Reportedly Witnessed Mysterious Orange Orb UFO Off East Coast</h2>

<p>In early 2004, nearly 200 sailors aboard the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan reportedly saw an unidentified flying object (UFO) off the East Coast. The object, described as a glowing orange sphere, hovered above the ship for several hours. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident has drawn attention due to its mysterious nature and the number of eyewitnesses involved. Documentary filmmaker Dave C. Beaty has investigated the case, interviewing several crew members who experienced the event. The sighting remains unacknowledged by official military channels, raising questions about UFO encounters in U.S. naval history.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in early 2004.</li>
    <li>Location: Off the East Coast of the United States.</li>
    <li>Approximately 200 sailors witnessed the event.</li>
    <li>The UFO was described as a 40-foot-wide glowing orange orb.</li>
    <li>Reported duration of sighting: several hours, starting around 8 p.m.</li>
    <li>Witnesses included Patrick Gokey and Carroll Olesiak, among others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Witnesses have reported that the glowing orb appeared around 8 p.m. and lingered above the USS Ronald Reagan for several hours. During this time, sailors remained calm, and one crew member noted that they were instructed not to record the event in the official ship log. By the following morning, daily operations aboard the carrier had returned to normal.</p>

<p>Some crew members speculated that the object could have been a weather balloon, but others, including Derrick Smith, expressed skepticism about this explanation. Smith described the encounter as the most mysterious thing he had ever witnessed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sight reminded me of the ‘burning bush’ described in the Bible,” said Carroll Olesiak, who recorded the ship's navigation log that night. “It seemed to radiate a negative energy.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I’m just an ordinary guy,” said Derrick Smith. “Before or after that night, I’ve never experienced anything supernatural — but I know what I saw, and it couldn’t be explained.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The USS Ronald Reagan incident is part of a broader pattern of UFO sightings reported by U.S. military personnel. Many similar encounters have been documented, often going unacknowledged or forgotten over time. Beaty has noted that the Ronald Reagan case closely resembles other incidents, where initial excitement fades into obscurity.</p>

<p>Beaty continues to seek out more witnesses to help illuminate this enigmatic event, which remains one of the Navy's most puzzling UFO mysteries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident are ongoing, with hopes that additional witnesses will come forward. Beaty aims to compile further testimonies to gain clarity on the event and its implications for U.S. naval history.</p>
