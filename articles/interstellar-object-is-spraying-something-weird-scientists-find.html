      <h2>Interstellar Object Is Spraying Something Weird, Scientists Find</h2>

<p>A new analysis of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has revealed that it is ejecting large amounts of water vapor, according to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. The comet displayed strong ultraviolet emissions indicative of hydroxyl gas (OH) when observed by NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift space telescope before it moved behind the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it suggests that the comet may contain considerable stores of water, which is essential for understanding the chemistry of life beyond Earth. Astronomers are now investigating the unusual water ejection, which occurs at a distance of about three astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, contrary to the behavior of typical comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: Approximately 3 AU</li>
    <li>Water ejection rate: About 40 kilograms per second</li>
    <li>Observation tool: NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift space telescope</li>
    <li>Study published in: The Astrophysical Journal Letters</li>
    <li>Current location: Behind the Sun, observable from Earth in late November</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2019 as it entered the solar system. Recent observations conducted before its passage behind the Sun indicated strong ultraviolet emissions. These findings have sparked interest in the comet's unusual behavior and the potential implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we detect water — or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH — from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, a professor of physics at Auburn University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, the lead author of the study. “Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. Each of these objects has presented unique characteristics, challenging existing theories about the formation and evolution of comets and planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it re-emerges from behind the Sun in late November. Further observations will help clarify the mechanisms behind the comet's water vapor ejection and its overall composition.</p>
