      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS records massive water production in exclusive SOHO observations after perihelion</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has produced significant amounts of water following its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, according to observations from the SWAN instrument on board the SOHO satellite. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the comet's activity.</p>

<p>This discovery is crucial as it provides valuable insights into the composition and behaviour of interstellar objects. Agencies including NASA and ESA have mobilized resources to track the comet since its initial detection in July 2025, allowing for detailed studies that were not possible with previous interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed through perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Water production peaked at 3.17 × 10²⁹ molecules per second on November 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun at this time.</li>
    <li>Initial discovery occurred on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system.</li>
    <li>The comet's core has an estimated diameter between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>SWAN has been monitoring all-sky ultraviolet hydrogen emission since 1996.</li>
    <li>Approximately 20% of the comet's surface area exhibited activity, higher than typical solar comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System program. It passed its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025. Nine days later, on November 6, the SWAN instrument recorded a significant glow around the comet, indicating high water production. In early December 2025, water production rates decreased to between 10 and 20 trillion trillion molecules per second, reflecting reduced solar heating.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These data provide valuable information about the composition and behavior of interstellar visitors,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS builds on previous observations of interstellar objects, such as 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike 1I/’Oumuamua, which showed minimal volatile activity, 2I/Borisov behaved more like a typical comet. 3I/ATLAS combines traits from both, notably its high water production, which suggests it formed in a cold environment similar to protoplanetary disks.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The comet is continuing its trajectory away from the Solar System, and researchers will use the accumulated observations to refine models of star and planetary formation. Future detections of interstellar objects may benefit from the techniques applied in this study.</p>
