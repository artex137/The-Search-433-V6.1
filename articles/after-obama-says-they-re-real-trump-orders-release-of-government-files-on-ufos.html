      <h2>After Obama says they're real, Trump orders release of government files on UFOs</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has ordered the government to release more information on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) following comments made by former President Barack Obama about the existence of extraterrestrial life. Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on February 19, accusing Obama of disclosing classified information and stating that his remarks were a "big mistake."</p>

<p>This development comes amid growing public interest in UFOs and government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Trump directed the Department of Defense and other agencies to disclose records related to UFOs and alien life, citing the "tremendous interest" shown by the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Trump spoke on February 19, 2026, aboard Air Force One.</li>
    <li>Obama made comments about aliens in a podcast interview published on February 14, 2026.</li>
    <li>Trump accused Obama of revealing classified information.</li>
    <li>Congress has held three hearings on UFOs since 2023.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon's UFO office found no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2026, Obama answered a question about aliens during a podcast interview, stating, "They're real, but I haven't seen them." His comments drew significant attention and prompted him to clarify his remarks on social media.</p>
<p>On February 19, Trump criticized Obama during a press conference, asserting that the former president had disclosed classified information. Later that day, Trump announced he would order the release of government files related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Since 2023, Congress has held multiple hearings on UFO sightings, with four witnesses testifying in September about their experiences with UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He gave classified information, he's not supposed to be doing that,” Trump said. “He made a big mistake.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Obama clarified his remarks, stating, “The odds are good there’s life out there... but the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UFOs has surged in recent years, with U.S. government agencies facing pressure to disclose information. The Pentagon's UFO office reported in September 2023 that it found no evidence supporting the existence of extraterrestrial beings, a conclusion echoed by NASA in its own report.</p>
<p>Congress has taken an active role in investigating UAPs, holding hearings and gathering testimony from military personnel and experts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Department of Defense and other agencies are expected to begin the process of releasing information related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life in response to Trump's directive. Further congressional hearings may also be scheduled as interest in the topic continues to grow.</p>
