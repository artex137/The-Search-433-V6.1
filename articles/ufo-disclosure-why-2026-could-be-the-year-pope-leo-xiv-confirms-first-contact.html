      <h2>UFO Disclosure: Why 2026 Could Be The Year Pope Leo XIV Confirms 'First Contact'</h2>

<p>In May 2025, the smoke from the Sistine Chapel turned white, signaling the election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American-born pontiff. As 2026 approaches, the Vatican may be preparing for a significant announcement regarding extraterrestrial life. British filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee claims to have gained rare access to the Vatican's secret archives to investigate historical references to unexplained phenomena and potential encounters with non-human intelligences.</p>

<p>This development matters as it suggests the Catholic Church may be navigating the implications of confirming intelligent life beyond Earth. Lee's findings indicate that the Vatican's interest in the cosmos goes beyond academic inquiry, possibly hinting at preparations for a profound cosmic revelation. He posits that global interest in UFO disclosure has reached a peak, which could lead to a pivotal moment for the Church.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Event: Election of Pope Leo XIV, May 2025</li>
<li>Filmmaker: Mark Christopher Lee, director of God Vs Aliens</li>
<li>Location: Vatican City</li>
<li>Focus: Investigation into historical accounts of extraterrestrial encounters</li>
<li>Current Vatican astronomer: Father Richard D'Souza</li>
<li>Potential year of disclosure: 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2025, Pope Leo XIV was elected, becoming the first American-born pope. Following this, Mark Christopher Lee began his investigation into the Vatican's archives, seeking historical references to unexplained phenomena. In early 2026, he anticipates revealing findings that could confirm the Church's engagement with the concept of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<blockquote>“If we are close to confirming intelligent life beyond Earth, no institution will feel the shockwaves more than the Catholic Church,” Lee explained.</blockquote>

<p>Earlier in 2023, Father Richard D'Souza suggested he would be willing to baptise an alien, reflecting the Vatican's evolving stance on the existence of life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Vatican's interest in extraterrestrial life isn't entirely new. In 2008, Father Gabriel Funes, then-director of the Vatican Observatory, stated that the existence of aliens would not contradict Christian faith. This perspective has continued to gain traction under Pope Leo XIV's leadership, indicating a shift in how the Church views the cosmos.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Mark Christopher Lee continues to investigate the Vatican's archives, he aims to uncover how prepared the Church is for a potential confirmation of extraterrestrial life. The world awaits to see if 2026 will be the year the Vatican addresses the implications of 'First Contact.'</p>
