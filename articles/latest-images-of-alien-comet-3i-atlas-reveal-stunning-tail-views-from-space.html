      <h2>Latest images of alien comet 3I/ATLAS reveal stunning tail, views from space</h2>

<p>This week, astronomers and NASA spacecraft have captured new images of comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through our solar system. The latest observations come after the comet emerged from behind the Sun, offering stunning views from both Earth-based telescopes and various space missions. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The imagery showcases the comet's bright head and long, wispy tail, which were not as visible before its closest pass by the Sun. Astronomers are excited about these findings, as they reveal the comet's characteristics and behavior, dispelling internet rumors regarding alien technology. NASA has stated that the comet behaves like a typical comet, consisting of ice, dust, and rock heated by the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was imaged on November 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was observed by the Virtual Telescope Project in Manciano, Italy.</li>
    <li>NASA spacecraft have been capturing images since September 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the Sun occurred in October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's observation campaign includes multiple spacecraft, including Psyche, Lucy, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 2025, NASA's Psyche and Lucy missions aimed their cameras at comet 3I/ATLAS, capturing images from a distance of approximately 386 million km. The Psyche spacecraft used its Multispectral Imager A camera to take four images over eight hours.</p>

<p>On October 15-26, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and other missions collected images during the comet's closest approach to the Sun. The images revealed the comet's structure, including its tail and anti-tail.</p>

<p>On November 19, 2025, the Virtual Telescope Project released new images showcasing the comet's tail and head. These images were part of a broader observation campaign by NASA, which continues to monitor the comet's progress.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “NASA is in the midst of an unprecedented solar system-wide observation campaign, turning its spacecraft and space telescopes to follow comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system,” the agency stated on their website.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. Its unique composition and behavior have intrigued scientists, particularly concerning its high nickel to iron ratio and its unusual water to CO2 ice ratio. These characteristics are attributed to its formation in a distant star system and its long journey through interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue observing comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves further into the inner solar system. The agency expects to release more images and data as the comet becomes visible to larger telescopes, likely in December 2025.</p>
