      <h2>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope brings more insights about interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, ever observed</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has provided new insights into the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS through a series of photographs taken on August 6, 2025. The findings have been published in a non-peer-reviewed study in the journal Zenodo. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this scientific observation.</p>

<p>This research matters because it may help scientists determine the comet's origin and trajectory, expanding our understanding of the universe. The comet, first sighted in July 2025, is currently on a path toward the Sun and has intrigued astronomers since its discovery.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be 3 billion years old.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the largest interstellar object observed to date.</li>
    <li>The JWST observations occurred on August 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>Findings indicate a high carbon dioxide (CO₂) to water (H₂O) ratio.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass the Sun in October 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025, capturing the attention of astronomers. The JWST conducted observations on August 6, 2025, using its Near-Infrared Spectrograph to analyze the comet's size and composition. Following this, various telescopes, including the Very Large Telescope in Chile, have contributed additional data about the object.</p>

<p>Past findings confirm that 3I/ATLAS will move past the Sun in October 2025 before exiting the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No one knows where the comet came from,” said David Jewitt, an astronomer at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and science team leader for the Hubble observations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO₂-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets,” the researchers wrote in the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We just cracked open the door to a whole new world of chemistry that we never had access to before,” said Thomas Puzia, an astronomer at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed by astronomers. Prior studies of similar objects have provided insights into the formation and evolution of the solar system. Research on 3I/ATLAS could enhance our knowledge of interstellar objects and their chemical properties.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun in October 2025. Further analysis of its composition and trajectory may lead to new discoveries about its origins and the environments it has encountered in space.</p>
