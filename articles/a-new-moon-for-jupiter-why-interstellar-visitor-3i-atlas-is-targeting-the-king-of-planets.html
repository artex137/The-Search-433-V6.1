      <h2>A New Moon For Jupiter? Why Interstellar Visitor 3I/ATLAS Is Targeting The King Of Planets</h2>

<p>As 2026 unfolds, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set for a close encounter with Jupiter on 16 March 2026. The comet, which has previously passed Mars and Earth, will fly by Jupiter at a distance of 53.61 million kilometres, a trajectory that has sparked significant interest among astronomers.</p>

<p>This event is important because it could potentially lead to the discovery of a new moon around Jupiter. Harvard Professor Avi Loeb has raised the possibility that 3I/ATLAS may not just be a comet but could be a piece of alien technology capable of deploying sensors during its flyby. Current knowledge indicates that Jupiter has 95 known moons, and the arrival of a 96th moon could signify a technological signature from the interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: 16 March 2026</li>
    <li>Distance from Jupiter: 53.61 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Close encounter with Eupheme: 17 March 2026</li>
    <li>Distance from Eupheme: 30.46 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Current number of Jupiter's moons: 95</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has already completed flybys of Mars and Earth before its approach to Jupiter. On 16 March 2026, it will make its closest pass to the gas giant, and the following day, it will approach the irregular moon Eupheme.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS nears Jupiter, astronomers will observe its path closely. The comet's trajectory has raised questions regarding its origins and potential implications for our understanding of celestial objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“A kick of the required magnitude and direction to bring a fragment of 3I/ATLAS into a bound orbit around Jupiter is an impossible outcome from the break-up of a comet,” said Professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Whether 3I/ATLAS leaves behind a scientific mystery or a new member of the Jovian family, its departure marks the end of a historic visit that has challenged our understanding of the objects that drift between the stars,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The potential for 3I/ATLAS to reveal new information about Jupiter's moons is significant. The comet's unique trajectory and its interaction with Jupiter and its moons could provide insights into the composition and dynamics of celestial bodies in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches its rendezvous with Jupiter, astronomers will continue to monitor its path. The scientific community is eager to see the outcome of this event and whether it will lead to the discovery of a new moon or additional insights into interstellar objects.</p>
