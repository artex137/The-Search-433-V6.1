      <h2>3I/Atlas’s anti-tail ‘flipped’ as it nears Earth</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has shown unusual behavior as it approaches Earth, with its anti-tail reportedly 'flipped' in orientation. The comet will make its closest approach on December 19 at a distance of 167 million miles (270 million kilometers), according to NASA. The comet poses no threat to Earth and remains visible to major observatories and space missions.</p>

<p>This development has sparked renewed interest among scientists, particularly Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb, who claims the flipped anti-tail suggests the comet may contain materials not seen in typical Solar System comets. Authorities continue to monitor the comet as it remains observable for several more months before exiting the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will pass Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The closest approach will be at a distance of 167 million miles (270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is currently visible to major observatories and space missions.</li>
    <li>Professor Avi Loeb has noted 13 anomalies in the comet's behavior.</li>
    <li>Loeb has published 11 papers on 3I/Atlas, proposing alternative explanations for its characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first identified as an interstellar comet. Recent observations have revealed anomalies in its behavior, including the flipping of its anti-tail. Professor Avi Loeb published analyses discussing these findings, raising questions about the composition of the comet.</p>

<p>Loeb observed that the anti-tail flipped direction before and after perihelion, a phenomenon not explained by traditional comet physics. He has criticized the scientific community for dismissing alternative explanations too quickly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The orientation of the anti-tail flipped relative to the direction of motion at perihelion and is definitely not a matter of perspective,” said Professor Avi Loeb in his analysis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There is no doubt that we can learn something new from the interstellar visitor, whether it is a conventional icy body or something more unconventional,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar object to enter the Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The behavior of these objects often challenges existing comet theories, prompting discussions about their unique characteristics. Loeb has emphasized the need for open-minded investigation into these anomalies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its approach, scientists will monitor its behavior closely. Loeb advocates for further investigation into the comet's properties and the implications they may have for understanding interstellar objects.</p>
