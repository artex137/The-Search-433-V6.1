      <h2>Karoline Leavitt pledges to keep public 'posted' on UFOs amid 'great interest' admission</h2>

<p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, has acknowledged the public's growing interest in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during a press briefing on Wednesday, February 14, 2024. She responded to a question about extraterrestrials posed by Newsmax correspondent Mike Carter, sparking renewed discussions on the topic following former President Barack Obama's recent comments about aliens.</p>

<p>This exchange highlights a significant moment in public discourse regarding UFOs and extraterrestrial life, as both current and former government officials engage with the topic. Leavitt's remarks suggest that the administration may take steps to address public curiosity and transparency regarding government knowledge of UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of briefing: February 14, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: White House</li>
    <li>Press Secretary: Karoline Leavitt</li>
    <li>Questioner: Mike Carter, Newsmax correspondent</li>
    <li>Former President: Barack Obama</li>
    <li>Obama's remarks about aliens: "They're real. But I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51."</li>
    <li>Trump's planned actions: Directing the Secretary of War to identify and release government files on UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2024, during a White House press briefing, Karoline Leavitt engaged in a lighthearted exchange with Newsmax correspondent Mike Carter about extraterrestrials. This conversation followed a podcast appearance by former President Barack Obama, where he stated that aliens are real but clarified that he had not seen them.</p>

<p>In the days following Obama's comments, he elaborated on his statements, emphasizing the vastness of the universe and the low probability of alien visitation. His remarks ignited significant social media discussion, prompting Leavitt to express her personal interest in the topic during the press briefing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That sounds very exciting, though. That would be of great interest to me personally, and I'm sure all of you in this room, and apparently former President Obama too. So we'll keep you posted on that,” said Karoline Leavitt during the briefing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Former President Barack Obama stated, “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens are low.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>President Donald Trump wrote, “Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs).”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Public fascination with extraterrestrial life has a long history, particularly surrounding Area 51, a secretive testing site in Nevada. The CIA acknowledged the existence of Area 51 in 2013 but denied claims of UFO crashes and alien encounters. In recent years, Congress has held hearings on UFO encounters, reflecting the increasing interest in government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>In 2024, a UFO whistleblower claimed that President Trump had received briefings on classified operations related to extraterrestrials, further fueling public curiosity and speculation about government knowledge of UFOs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The White House has indicated that it will continue to provide updates on the government's exploration and release of information related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Further actions from the Trump administration regarding the identification and release of classified files are anticipated.</p>
