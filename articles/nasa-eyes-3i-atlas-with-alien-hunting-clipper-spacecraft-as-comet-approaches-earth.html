      <h2>NASA eyes 3I/ATLAS with alien-hunting Clipper spacecraft as comet approaches Earth</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft has conducted seven hours of ultraviolet observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with the closest approach expected overnight on December 18-19. The comet will come within approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) of the planet. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it allows scientists to analyze the elements emitted by the comet, contributing to our understanding of its composition. The Europa Clipper, which is designed to search for signs of extraterrestrial life, is in a prime position to observe 3I/ATLAS as both objects move toward Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at an estimated speed of 153,000 mph (246,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 18-19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will be about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) from Earth at its closest point.</li>
    <li>The Europa Clipper spacecraft took images from a distance of about 102 million miles (164 million km) on November 6.</li>
    <li>NASA scientists have noted that 3I/ATLAS is rich in carbon dioxide ice and emits diatomic carbon gas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 6, 2023, the Europa Clipper spacecraft captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS from a distance of approximately 102 million miles (164 million km). The spacecraft conducted seven hours of ultraviolet observations to gather data on the comet's composition.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth on December 18-19, 2023, amateur astronomers have the opportunity to observe the comet, though expectations should be tempered regarding visibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Using the same technology that will ultimately plumb the secrets of Jupiter's moon, Clipper's observations of 3I/ATLAS will be key in analyzing the elements spewing out of the comet and forming the makeshift atmosphere, or coma, around it,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations have established that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, rich in carbon dioxide ice. It is known for its distinctive greenish glow due to the release of diatomic carbon gas. The Europa Clipper mission aims to study the surface and atmosphere of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, and investigate the potential for alien life beneath its icy crust.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to release further findings from the Europa Clipper's observations of 3I/ATLAS as data becomes available. The spacecraft is scheduled to arrive in the Jovian neighborhood in April 2030, where it will begin its search for signs of extraterrestrial life.</p>
