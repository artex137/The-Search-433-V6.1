      <h2>'Spaceship' 3I/Atlas could be 'much older than our solar system' as mystery deepens</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be much older than our solar system, according to a claim by astronomer Michele Bannister at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Bannister leads a team studying the comet, which could be up to <strong>14 billion years old</strong>. The discovery raises significant questions about the origins of the comet and its implications for our understanding of cosmic history.</p>

<p>This finding is important as it suggests that 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into the early universe. Bannister stated that this comet represents a "once in a lifetime opportunity" for researchers to explore the building blocks of planet formation from an ancient star system. The University of Canterbury team, in collaboration with Professor Chris Lintott at the University of Oxford, has been studying the comet since its identification.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS could be between <strong>8 and 14 billion years old</strong>.</li>
    <li>The solar system is approximately <strong>4.6 billion years old</strong>.</li>
    <li>Michele Bannister leads the research team at the University of Canterbury.</li>
    <li>Collaboration with Professor Chris Lintott at the University of Oxford.</li>
    <li>Observations of the comet will continue throughout January.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in <strong>2023</strong>. Shortly after its discovery, the research team at the University of Canterbury began studying its velocity to estimate its age. Bannister's team revealed findings regarding the comet's distinctive chemistry, which differs from that of comets within our solar system.</p>

<p>In recent months, the comet has sparked debate among scientists. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be an "alien spaceship" due to its unusual characteristics. He argues that the comet's 'anti-tail' should not contain "streaming gas beyond a distance of <strong>5,000 kilometres</strong> from the nucleus," raising questions about its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Michele Bannister stated, "Our team has discovered that 3I/ATLAS is between eight and 14 billion years old, much older than our entire solar system, which has existed for 4.6 billion years."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Bannister added, "The chemistry of 3I/ATLAS is distinctive relative to our solar system comets, which is one of the things that will tell us what its home environment was like."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Avi Loeb mentioned, "The content of the 'anti-tail' can be tested by a molecular tracer which should help us to understand if it is a comet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects, which may provide clues about the formation of stars and planets outside our solar system. Previous interstellar comets have raised similar questions, but none have presented the same opportunity for analysis as 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>The debate surrounding the comet's nature highlights the challenges scientists face when interpreting data from distant celestial bodies. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have prompted both excitement and skepticism within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research team will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS throughout January to gather more data on its composition and behavior. Further analysis may help clarify the comet's origins and the validity of competing theories regarding its nature.</p>
