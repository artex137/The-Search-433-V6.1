      <h2>NASA Defends Fuzzy HiRISE Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has defended its official images of Comet 3I/ATLAS, which were captured by the HiRISE camera, following the release of sharper images by amateur astronomers. The debate over image quality has arisen as the comet approaches Earth.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights the differences between professional and amateur astronomical imaging. NASA has stated that the official images, while not visually striking, provide valuable data for scientific study. The comet, discovered on 1 July 2025, has intrigued both the public and experts due to its unusual features.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS observatory in Chile.</li>
    <li>NASA's HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured the images.</li>
    <li>NASA's images were released during a government shutdown, causing delays.</li>
    <li>Amateur astronomers have produced significantly sharper images of the comet.</li>
    <li>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has noted 12 unusual features of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025. NASA's HiRISE camera began capturing images of the comet as it approached Earth. Due to a government shutdown, the release of these images was postponed. Amateur astronomers subsequently released sharper images, prompting a public debate over the quality of NASA’s official photographs.</p>

<p>As the public expressed disappointment with NASA's images, the agency addressed concerns via social media, explaining the limitations of its equipment and the context of the images captured.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Lots of reasons…but in short, it’s not what these spacecraft were designed to do. As comet 3I/ATLAS swooped by, we jumped on the opportunity to turn our instruments its way and see what we could get,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ATLAS observatory has identified numerous celestial objects, including 1,293 Near-Earth Asteroids and 110 comets. Comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn particular attention due to its peculiar characteristics, which have led to confusion among experts and the general public.</p>

<p>NASA's HiRISE camera, designed for capturing detailed images of Mars, has faced scrutiny for its performance in imaging distant cometary objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue sharing observations from its missions as they resume full operational capacity. The agency will also engage with the public to clarify the scientific value of its images of Comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>
