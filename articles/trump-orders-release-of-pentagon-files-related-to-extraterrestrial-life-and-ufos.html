      <h2>Trump orders release of Pentagon files related to extraterrestrial life and UFOs</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has instructed the Pentagon to identify and begin releasing files related to extraterrestrials and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), according to a post on Truth Social on Thursday. The announcement follows former President Barack Obama’s comments about aliens made during an interview released on Saturday.</p>

<p>Trump's directive highlights the government's ongoing investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena, which has garnered significant public interest. The Pentagon has increased its efforts to study these phenomena in recent years, with a recent intelligence report revealing numerous unexplained sightings, particularly from Navy and Air Force personnel.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of announcement:</strong> Thursday, not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li><strong>Former President's remarks:</strong> Barack Obama commented on aliens on Saturday</li>
    <li><strong>Recent intelligence report:</strong> Released in 2023, detailing hundreds of new UFO sightings</li>
    <li><strong>Government report (2024):</strong> No indication of extraterrestrial involvement in the sightings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 7, 2017, volunteers worked on an Avro Canada VZ-9AV Avrocar at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. This Cold War-era aircraft resembles a flying saucer. On Saturday, February 17, 2026, Obama discussed aliens during an interview with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen, stating, “they’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept … in Area 51.” In response, Trump issued his order for file release on Thursday, February 20, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’m instructing the Pentagon and other government agencies to identify and begin releasing files related to extraterrestrials and unidentified flying objects,” Trump stated on Truth Social.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Obama clarified on Instagram, “I had not seen any evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has intensified its investigation into UFOs over the past few years, driven by public curiosity and numerous reports from military personnel. Reports from 2023 indicated hundreds of new sightings, many of which remain unexplained. Previous reports, including one in 2024, concluded there was no evidence indicating that the sightings were connected to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has yet to provide a timeline for the release of the requested files. Investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena are ongoing, with continued efforts to analyze reports from military aviators.</p>
