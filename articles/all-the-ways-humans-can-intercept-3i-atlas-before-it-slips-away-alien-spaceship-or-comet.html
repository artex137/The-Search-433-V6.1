      <h2>All the ways humans can intercept 3I/Atlas before it slips away - Alien spaceship or comet?</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/Atlas has intrigued scientists as it approaches Earth, with debates surrounding its classification as either a comet or an alien spaceship. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has proposed two methods for humans to intercept 3I/Atlas to better understand its nature. The object has exhibited unusual movement, speed, trajectory, and brightness, leading to speculation about its origins.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it presents a unique opportunity for scientific discovery. Authorities and scientists are exploring ways to utilize existing space missions to study 3I/Atlas before it moves beyond reach. Loeb's proposals involve NASA's Juno spacecraft and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which could provide critical data on the interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas is moving at a speed of <strong>221,000 km/hr</strong>.</li>
    <li>NASA's Juno spacecraft could potentially intercept 3I/Atlas on <strong>March 14, 2026</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will be <strong>29 million kilometres</strong> from Mars on <strong>October 3</strong>.</li>
    <li>The distance to Mars could decrease to <strong>2.7 million kilometres</strong> shortly after October 3.</li>
    <li>Loeb suggests the possibility of a mini precursor probe associated with 3I/Atlas.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas's brightness increased five times in a few weeks, according to NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2011, NASA launched the Juno spacecraft to study Jupiter. Avi Loeb proposed that Juno could change its course to intercept 3I/Atlas by accelerating on <strong>September 14, 2025</strong>. If successful, a close encounter would occur on <strong>March 14, 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The second opportunity to study 3I/Atlas arises in October when it approaches Mars. On <strong>October 3</strong>, the object will be approximately <strong>29 million kilometres</strong> from Mars, with the potential to come as close as <strong>2.7 million kilometres</strong> shortly thereafter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The close encounter of 3I/ATLAS to Jupiter provides a rare opportunity to shift Juno from its current orbit around Jupiter to intercept the path of 3I/ATLAS at its closest approach to Jupiter,” said Avi Loeb in a blog.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/Atlas, interstellar objects have been a topic of interest among scientists, but few have approached our solar system. The unusual characteristics of 3I/Atlas, including its rapid speed and brightness fluctuations, have led to debates about its classification, with some scientists suggesting it may represent a new category of cosmic bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth, focusing on the potential for interception using Juno and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Further observations and calculations will determine the feasibility of these plans in the coming months.</p>
