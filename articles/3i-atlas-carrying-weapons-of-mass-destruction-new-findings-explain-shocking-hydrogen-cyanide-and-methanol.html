      <h2>3I/ATLAS carrying weapons of mass destruction? New findings explain shocking hydrogen cyanide and methanol</h2>

<p>New data has revealed the presence of methanol and hydrogen cyanide near the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Scientists utilized the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the comet, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances understanding of interstellar chemistry and the origins of comets. The findings support discussions on organic processes and the potential for life beyond Earth. Authorities, including NASA, are closely monitoring the comet and its chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>ALMA detected methanol on August 28, September 18, September 22, and October 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Hydrogen cyanide was detected on September 12 and September 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was between 2.6 and 1.7 astronomical units from the Sun during observations.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at more than 210,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object discovered after 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Observations by ALMA began shortly after, with methanol detected on August 28, September 18, September 22, and October 1. Hydrogen cyanide was identified on September 12 and September 15.</p>
<p>During these observations, the comet was positioned between 2.6 and 1.7 astronomical units from the Sun. The production rates of methanol and hydrogen cyanide were noted, indicating significant chemical activity as the comet approached the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The chemical mix supports discussions on organic processes and the journey of this interstellar comet through the solar system.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic trajectory, which prevents it from returning to the solar system. It follows in the footsteps of 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which have provided valuable insights into the nature of interstellar materials. The presence of methanol and hydrogen cyanide raises questions about the origins of life and the potential for panspermia, the hypothesis that life can be distributed throughout the universe via comets and asteroids.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other research organizations will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Further studies will focus on understanding the implications of the detected chemicals and their relevance to organic chemistry and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>
