      <h2>NASA Detects Water on Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA astronomers have confirmed the detection of water’s chemical fingerprint on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, a significant breakthrough in planetary science, as reported on October 15, 2023. This discovery may reshape our understanding of comet evolution and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>The detection of water on 3I/ATLAS is crucial because it suggests that planetary systems outside our Solar System may have similar chemical compositions to our own. Scientists are now analyzing this data to gain insights into the formation and evolution of comets and planetary systems across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawaii.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be at least seven billion years old.</li>
    <li>Nasa's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected hydroxyl (OH) gas, a byproduct of water, around the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is losing water at a rate of approximately 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The findings have been published in a newly released study.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS is identified by the ATLAS system in Hawaii. Following this, astronomers have conducted extensive observations of the comet. On October 15, 2023, NASA confirms the detection of water's chemical fingerprint through its Swift Observatory.</p>

<p>The ultraviolet signal detected indicates the presence of hydroxyl gas, which forms when sunlight breaks apart water molecules. This finding marks the first evidence of water activity on an interstellar comet at such an extreme distance from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Dr. Zexi Xing, lead researcher.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Each interstellar comet we’ve observed has rewritten the rules,” said Prof. Dennis Bodewits, co-author of the study. “When we detect water or its fragments from an interstellar comet, we’re essentially reading a note from another planetary system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, 1I/‘Oumuamua was observed to be dry, while 2I/Borisov was found to be rich in carbon monoxide. The detection of water on 3I/ATLAS suggests a diversity in the chemical compositions of interstellar comets, which could indicate that the building blocks of life are more common in the galaxy than previously thought.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it becomes observable again after mid-November 2025. This will provide scientists with further opportunities to track its chemical activity and gain insights into the comet's characteristics and implications for planetary systems.</p>
