      <h2>First X-Ray Image Of Comet 3I/ATLAS Reveals Signature Unseen In Other Interstellar Objects</h2>

<p>Researchers have captured the first X-ray image of Comet 3I/ATLAS, a significant finding made between November 26 and November 28, 2025, using the XRISM X-ray telescope. This observation marks the comet as the first interstellar object to exhibit an X-ray signature, according to a team of astronomers.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it enhances the understanding of comet behavior and interstellar objects. The X-ray emissions result from interactions between solar plasma and the comet's coma, which is the cloud of gas and dust surrounding the comet. Astronomers aim to further analyze the data to confirm the findings and explore additional X-ray characteristics of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The X-ray observations occurred from November 26, 2025, at 23:20 to November 28, 2025, at 20:38.</li>
    <li>The effective exposure time for the observations was 17 hours.</li>
    <li>The X-ray glow spans approximately 400,000 kilometers (250,000 miles).</li>
    <li>Preliminary data show X-ray signatures of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2023. Observations for X-ray emissions began on November 26, 2025, when the comet was positioned far enough from the Sun to allow safe observation. The data collection continued until November 28, 2025, resulting in a significant finding for the astronomical community.</p>

<p>The comet has been noted to be faster, older, and more active than its interstellar predecessors, 1I/’Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It might look like a blob, but a very interesting blob!”</blockquote> 
<p>— JAXA, regarding the X-ray image of Comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The emission of X-rays from comets has been known since 1996, starting with Comet Hyakutake. However, no interstellar object had previously shown such emissions. The observation of Comet 3I/ATLAS could lead to new insights into the interactions between solar plasma and cometary atmospheres.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Other X-ray observatories will now be able to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS safely, and researchers anticipate further X-ray insights in the coming weeks as the comet approaches its closest distance to Earth.</p>
