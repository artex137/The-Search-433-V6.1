      <h2>New Hubble images detect collimated structure in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS facing the Sun</h2>

<p>The <strong>Hubble Space Telescope</strong> has captured new images of the interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, revealing a highly organized structure, including a tightly collimated anti-tail jet directed towards the Sun. The observations were conducted in <strong>January 2026</strong> and show this characteristic persisting after the comet's perihelion.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about existing models of cometary activity. Researchers are examining whether solar wind and radiation pressure can fully explain the phenomenon observed in this third confirmed interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified on <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>, by the <strong>ATLAS system</strong> in Chile.</li>
    <li>The object passed perihelion on <strong>October 29, 2025</strong>, at approximately <strong>1.36 AU</strong> from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth occurred on <strong>December 19, 2025</strong>, at about <strong>269 million kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>The orbital eccentricity of greater than <strong>6</strong> indicates that the comet is not gravitationally bound to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Observations have shown a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the comet's coma, with CO2 levels reaching record proportions among known comets.</li>
    <li>The core's diameter is estimated to be between <strong>0.5 and 5.6 kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational accelerations and brightness variations suggest a rotation period of around <strong>15 to 16 hours</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile. Early observations date back to June 2025, confirming its interstellar origin through its hyperbolic trajectory. The comet passed perihelion on October 29, 2025, and came closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>
<p>Throughout its passage, several telescopes and space missions have recorded data on 3I/ATLAS, including detailed images from Hubble in July and November 2025, as well as recent captures from January 2026. The Subaru Telescope also recorded observations in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of this structure raises questions about current models of cometary activity,” said a researcher involved in the analysis.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Its unique characteristics, such as the high levels of carbon dioxide and the collimated jet structure, differ significantly from comets originating from the Oort cloud or Kuiper belt. This anomaly prompts researchers to explore unconventional origins and natural explanations for the observed configurations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Solar System. Future observations of similar objects will depend on early warning systems like ATLAS, aiming to refine models of interstellar dynamics and chemical composition.</p>
