      <h2>Steven Spielberg’s UFO movie teased with cryptic new poster</h2>

<p>Production on Steven Spielberg’s upcoming UFO movie has wrapped this summer, but details about the project remain largely undisclosed.

<p>The marketing for the film has begun to emerge, prompting speculation about its title and content. The billboard’s imagery has led some to believe that the long-rumoured title, Disclosure, may be the final choice.
