      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Set for Rare Celestial Event on January 22, 2026</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach a significant point in its journey through our solar system on January 22, 2026, at 13:00 UTC, when it aligns perfectly with the Earth and the Sun. This alignment, known as "opposition," presents a unique opportunity for scientists and astronomers to observe the comet in unprecedented detail.</p>

<p>The event is critical for understanding the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which is moving at a remarkable speed of 57.7 kilometers per second. Astronomers expect this alignment will trigger a phenomenon called the "Opposition Surge," where the comet’s surface will be illuminated, allowing for a clearer view of its features. Authorities and scientists are preparing for this event, which may reveal whether the comet is a collection of dust or a more solid structure.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> January 22, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Event Time:</strong> 13:00 UTC</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Speed:</strong> 57.7 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Comet Speeds:</strong> ‘Oumuamua at 26.4 km/s, 2I/Borisov at 32.3 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Phenomena:</strong> Opposition Surge, Shadow-hiding, Coherent Backscatter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been travelling through the solar system, and astronomers have tracked its trajectory. The comet is set to align with Earth and the Sun on January 22, 2026. This event will allow for optimal observation conditions, revealing potential features of the comet.</p>

<p>The "Opposition Surge" will occur due to the near-zero angle between the Sun, Earth, and the comet, eliminating shadows and enhancing brightness. Scientists are particularly interested in the effects of "Coherent Backscatter," which may indicate the physical characteristics of the comet's surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The alignment on January 22 offers more than just light. It offers a glimpse into the quantum realm,” said an unnamed astronomer. “This is the moment of truth.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior interstellar visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided limited insights due to their rapid passage and distance. Unlike these previous comets, 3I/ATLAS is expected to offer a more detailed view, potentially reshaping our understanding of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the date approaches, astronomers will continue to prepare for observations and data collection during the event, aiming to analyze the comet's characteristics and behavior. The findings could lead to significant advancements in our knowledge of cometary science and interstellar objects.</p>
