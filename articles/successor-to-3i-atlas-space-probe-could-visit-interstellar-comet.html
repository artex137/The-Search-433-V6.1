      <h2>Successor to 3I/ATLAS: Space probe could visit interstellar comet</h2>

<p>A research team from the USA has developed a concept for a space probe that could visit the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the solar system. The design, created at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), has not been made public, but the team indicates that the mission could involve a flyby of the comet, currently hurtling through the solar system.</p>

<p>This mission is significant because it could provide unprecedented insights into the composition and structure of interstellar comets. Matthew Freeman from SwRI stated that the orbit of 3I/ATLAS is within the interceptable range of the proposed mission, which aims to gather data about how such celestial bodies form in other planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is the third interstellar visitor to the solar system discovered during a flyby.</li>
    <li>The proposed space probe would be accelerated to the orbit of Mars before racing towards the comet.</li>
    <li>Details of the mission design have not been disclosed by SwRI.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to the sun is expected in the fall of 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July 2023, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS in Chile. Following this, the research team at SwRI developed a concept for a space probe capable of visiting the comet. The design was conceived prior to the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, indicating a pre-existing interest in exploring interstellar comets.</p>
<p>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to the sun will occur in the fall of 2023, which is expected to result in significant material loss from the comet, complicating Earth-based analyses.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The orbit of 3I/ATLAS is within the interceptable range of the elaborated mission,” said Matthew Freeman from SwRI.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It would also be possible to explore such a celestial body directly in the future, provided the right preparations are made,” according to the research facility.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar object to be discovered during a flyby of the solar system. Previous interstellar visitors have provided valuable information about the composition and behavior of such celestial bodies, contributing to the understanding of their formation in different planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research team at SwRI is expected to continue developing the mission concept and preparing for potential future explorations of interstellar comets, pending further advancements in technology and mission planning.</p>
