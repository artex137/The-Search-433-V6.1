      <h2>Avi Loeb says key 3I/Atlas anomalies still unexplained, pushing back on claims that it’s just a normal comet</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has stated that important questions remain unanswered about the interstellar object 3I/Atlas during an interview with Newsmax, responding to acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy’s assertion that the object is simply a normal comet. Loeb argues that the situation is more complex and that further investigation is needed before reaching a definitive conclusion.</p>

<p>Loeb’s comments highlight ongoing debates in the scientific community about the nature of 3I/Atlas. He emphasizes the importance of evidence over expert consensus, suggesting that scientists should remain open to new possibilities rather than relying solely on established beliefs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Avi Loeb is a Harvard astrophysicist.</li>
<li>Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy believes 3I/Atlas is a normal comet.</li>
<li>Loeb has identified seven jets emitting from 3I/Atlas.</li>
<li>Loeb states that the jets are unusual in strength and number.</li>
<li>Loeb has calculated that a natural comet may not have enough surface area to support the gas flow from the jets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Dr. Avi Loeb discussed the anomalies observed in 3I/Atlas, particularly focusing on the seven jets that are not typical of natural comet behavior. He responded to comments made by Sean Duffy, who had expressed confidence in classifying 3I/Atlas as a normal comet. Loeb emphasized the need for more evidence and analysis to understand the object fully.</p>

<p>Loeb explained that scientific inquiry should not rely solely on expert opinions but should be grounded in measurable evidence. He pointed out specific characteristics of the jets that raise questions about their origin and nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The jets are unusual in strength and number,” Loeb said. “There is definitely a puzzle to be solved.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Confidence alone is not enough without full evidence,” Loeb added, urging scientists to continue examining the object carefully.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/Atlas reflects broader trends in the scientific community, where the classification of interstellar objects often leads to differing opinions. Previous interstellar visitors have also sparked debates about their nature and origins, highlighting the challenges faced by astronomers in understanding these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it moves through space, aiming to gather more data about the jets and the object's behavior. Further observations may help clarify whether the anomalies can be explained by natural processes or if they suggest something more complex.</p>
