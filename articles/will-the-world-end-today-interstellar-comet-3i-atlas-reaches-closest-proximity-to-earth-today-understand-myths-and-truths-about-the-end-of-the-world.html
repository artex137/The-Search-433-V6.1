      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has reached its closest point to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2025, coming within approximately 270 million kilometers, or about 1.8 astronomical units. Authorities, including NASA and international observatories, have confirmed that there is no threat to life on Earth from the comet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third confirmed object from outside the Solar System to approach Earth. Scientists are monitoring the comet's trajectory and activity closely, as it offers a unique opportunity to study materials from another star system. Experts emphasize that the comet's distance and size eliminate any potential for significant gravitational influence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas reached closest proximity to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Minimum distance: approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size: between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Speed: over 200,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Origin: likely from the constellation of Sagitário in the Milky Way.</li>
    <li>Confirmed by NASA and international observatories.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile. It traveled towards the inner Solar System, reaching perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun.</p>
<p>Following its closest approach to Earth, the comet will continue its path towards the outer regions of the Solar System, passing close to Jupiter in 2026 before leaving the Solar System entirely.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The distance of 270 million kilometers makes any noticeable effect on Earth impossible,” said a spokesperson from NASA regarding the comet's approach.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This event allows us to study primordial materials that may help us understand the formation of our Solar System,” noted an astronomer from an international observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar comet confirmed to have entered the Solar System, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Previous passages of interstellar objects have not resulted in observable changes on Earth, reinforcing the understanding that such encounters pose no threat to the planet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it moves away from Earth. Data collected will enhance understanding of its composition and age, contributing to models of comet ejection from distant star systems. Observations will remain ongoing until spring 2026, when the comet will be visible in the pre-dawn skies for amateur astronomers.</p>
