      <h2>Radio Signals and Heartbeat Jets From 3I/ATLAS Suggest a Coordinated, Non-Random Pattern Emerging</h2>

<p>On November 30, 2025, scientists reported two anomalies associated with comet 3I/ATLAS, one involving radio frequencies and the other related to jet mechanics. These findings suggest a potentially coordinated pattern in the comet's behavior, which has not been previously observed in natural comets.</p>

<p>The significance of these developments lies in their implications for understanding the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including researchers from Harvard University, are investigating the relationship between the radio signals and the pulsing jets emitted from the comet, as they may indicate a controlled mechanism rather than random natural activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of radio signal detection: November 14, 2025</li>
    <li>Frequencies of signals: 1665 and 1667 MHz</li>
    <li>Jet pulsation cycle: 16.16 hours</li>
    <li>Outflow velocity: 440 meters per second</li>
    <li>Distance of mass ejection: approximately 25,600 kilometers</li>
    <li>Next close pass of 3I/ATLAS: December 19, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 14, 2025, researchers detected a narrow-band absorption signature from 3I/ATLAS at two specific frequencies associated with interstellar communication. This was followed by a report on November 30, 2025, revealing a pulsing jet structure linked to the comet, which emits jets every 16.16 hours.</p>
<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb noted that this behavior resembles a heartbeat, indicating a potential control mechanism within the comet, rather than random outgassing typical of natural comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Natural comets produce chaotic outgassing, random jets, and broadband thermal noise. 3I/ATLAS is producing periodicity, selectivity, and narrow-frequency behavior,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the first time such coordinated radio emissions and jet activity have been observed in a comet. Previous studies of comets have shown erratic behavior in their outgassing and emissions, making the phenomena linked to 3I/ATLAS particularly noteworthy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely as it approaches its close pass on December 19, 2025. They aim to determine if the radio absorption and the jet pulsations are synchronized, which could provide further evidence of a controlled mechanism behind the comet's behavior.</p>
