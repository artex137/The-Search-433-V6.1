      <h2>Two Comets Whiz Past Earth This Week</h2>

<p>Two comets, C/2025 A4 (Lemmon) and C/2025 R2 (SWAN), will pass close to Earth this week, with Lemmon reaching its closest point on Tuesday, October 21, at approximately 56 million miles away, according to Livescience. SWAN will pass even closer, at about 24 million miles, making this a rare celestial event.</p>

<p>This cosmic double feature is significant as it marks the first time in over a year that two comets visible to the naked eye will be present in the night sky. Stargazers can expect Lemmon to be visible without binoculars, while SWAN will require them to observe its fly-by. The events are expected to attract attention from astronomy enthusiasts and casual observers alike.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comets:</strong> C/2025 A4 (Lemmon) and C/2025 R2 (SWAN)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach of Lemmon:</strong> October 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance of Lemmon from Earth:</strong> 56 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Distance of SWAN from Earth:</strong> 24 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility of Lemmon:</strong> Naked eye, best one and a half hours after sunset</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility of SWAN:</strong> Binoculars required, best around October 20</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream event:</strong> Hosted by Gianluca Masi's Virtual Telescope Project on October 20 at 1:30 PM</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 A4 (Lemmon) was discovered in January 2025 and has been steadily brightening. It will be most visible in the northwest sky, near the Big Dipper and the bright star Arcturus. Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was discovered in September 2025 and will be best seen in the southwest sky between the stars Vega, Deneb, and Altair.</p>

<p>Both comets are expected to reach their maximum brightness between October 20 and October 21, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “So far, living in the Northern hemisphere, I could admire C/2025 A6 Lemmon only, but C/2025 R2 SWAN is quickly joining the show and we are ready to amaze every astronomy lover with our live feed!” 
    — Gianluca Masi, Virtual Telescope Project
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event is notable as it is the first occurrence of two comets visible to the naked eye in over a year. Lemmon will not return to visibility until the year 3175, making this a rare opportunity for observers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomy enthusiasts are encouraged to observe the comets or participate in the livestream hosted by the Virtual Telescope Project. The close approach of these comets presents a unique chance to witness celestial phenomena.
