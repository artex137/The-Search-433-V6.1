      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS intrigues scientists with CO2-rich chemical composition and global alert</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in RÃ­o Hurtado, Chile, has sparked NASA's planetary defense protocols due to its unusual orbital behavior. The comet, traveling at over 210,000 km/h, poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Authorities have initiated a training exercise coordinated by the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, to refine measurements of the comet's hyperbolic trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Travels at over 210,000 km/h, reaching perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 270 million km.</li>
    <li>CO2 concentration in the coma exceeds six times expected variations in solar comets.</li>
    <li>IAWN training exercise runs from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus diameter: between 320 meters and 5.6 km.</li>
    <li>Expected exit from the Solar System: March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile identified the comet near the constellation of Sagittarius. Preliminary observations confirmed its extrasolar origin due to its high speed of 61 km/s. On August 6, 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) captured data revealing a coma dominated by carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>On October 21, 2025, data from the Harvard Minor Planet Center emphasized the need for international alerts as the comet approached solar conjunction, limiting visibility. The IAWN has organized a training exercise to improve methods for observing active comets during this period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "We face unique challenges in predicting variations in the comet's trajectory," said an IAWN representative. "The data we gather will enhance our understanding of planetary formation in distant systems."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS continues a trend of increasing interest in interstellar objects, with prior encounters including 'Oumuamua and Borisov. These discoveries have prompted enhanced international cooperation and protocol development for monitoring and studying such entities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and IAWN will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its perihelion. The training exercise aims to refine techniques for tracking similar objects in the future, ensuring improved readiness for planetary defense initiatives.</p>
