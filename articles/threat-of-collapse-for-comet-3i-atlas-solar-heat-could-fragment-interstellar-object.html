      <h2>Threat of collapse for comet 3I/ATLAS: solar heat could fragment interstellar object</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, is under intense astronomical surveillance as it approaches Sol, facing a significant risk of disintegration due to extreme temperatures and gravitational forces. Discovered in 2023, 3I/ATLAS shows signs of instability, prompting astronomers from various global institutions to monitor its evolution closely. Observations have intensified as the comet approaches its perihelion, expected to occur in 2026.</p>

<p>The impending collapse of 3I/ATLAS holds vital scientific importance. Its potential fragmentation could provide critical insights into planetary formation in regions beyond our solar system. Ongoing monitoring efforts aim to gather comprehensive data on the comet's composition and behavior, which may differ from that of comets native to our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> 2023 by the ATLAS project.</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li><strong>Expected perihelion:</strong> 2026, when it will be closest to Sol.</li>
    <li><strong>Current observations:</strong> Increased release of gases and dust, indicating instability.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Involvement of NASA and ESA for data collection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2023 by telescopes from the ATLAS project, marking it as the third known interstellar comet in our solar system. Following its discovery, astronomers have observed its hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its origins from outside our system.</p>
<p>In recent months, observations have indicated a significant increase in gas and dust release, suggesting that the comet is reacting to solar heat. This accelerated sublimation has resulted in a visible coma and has raised concerns about the comet's structural integrity.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion in 2026, scientists continue to monitor the comet closely for signs of fissures in its nucleus, which could precede fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The possible fragmentation of 3I/ATLAS represents a unique opportunity for the study of cosmic debris,” said an astronomer involved in the monitoring efforts. “The data we gather could reveal much about the physical processes that govern comet disintegration.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows in the footsteps of ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, the first two known interstellar comets to traverse our solar system. The study of such objects is crucial for understanding the conditions of planetary formation in different stellar systems, as they serve as messengers from regions beyond our own galactic neighborhood.</p>
<p>Historically, the fragmentation of interstellar comets is a rare phenomenon, occurring only a few times a century. The potential collapse of 3I/ATLAS could provide unprecedented data about the chemical composition of celestial objects from distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As monitoring continues, scientists aim to collect as much information as possible before the comet reaches its closest point to Sol. Ongoing spectroscopic analyses will help identify the comet’s chemical composition, which may offer clues about conditions in its region of origin.</p>
