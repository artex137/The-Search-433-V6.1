      <h2>Near 100% odds Donald Trump will reveal truth about UFOs as betting frenzy hits $6 million</h2>

<p>The likelihood of President Donald Trump revealing information about extraterrestrial life has surged to 98%, according to Polymarket, a leading online prediction platform. This increase follows a significant uptick in betting activity, with over $6 million wagered on the outcome. The surge in betting comes as speculation grows that Trump may disclose government secrets about UFOs before Christmas.</p>

<p>This development matters as it highlights public interest in potential government transparency regarding UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including the White House and various intelligence agencies, have historically denied any contact with alien life or possession of UFO technology. However, recent claims from whistleblowers and a new documentary have intensified the conversation surrounding these topics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Polymarket reports a rise in the odds of Trump disclosing UFO information from 6% to 98% since December 6.</li>
    <li>More than $6 million has been wagered on the possibility of Trump demanding the release of classified information.</li>
    <li>Whistleblower David Grusch has alleged that the US Government possesses alien remains and has encountered UFOs multiple times.</li>
    <li>Trump has expressed a desire to disclose findings from his administration regarding extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>For bets to be valid, Trump must declassify documents related to extraterrestrial life by the end of this year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 6, 2023, betting odds on Polymarket indicated a 6% chance that Trump would disclose UFO-related information. This figure has since risen sharply to 98%, coinciding with the placement of over $6 million in bets. The increased betting activity has been attributed to potential insider knowledge regarding Trump's intentions.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, multiple UFO researchers and a documentary titled "The Age of Disclosure" have brought attention to alleged government cover-ups and the existence of alien technology. Additionally, David Grusch, a retired US Air Force major, has made statements suggesting that Trump is prepared to share classified information about UFOs and extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I think someone on the inside close to Trump knows this and has been buying, hence the rise,” said UFO researcher Mark Christopher Lee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I'd love to do that. I have to do that,” Trump stated regarding the disclosure of findings on the Lex Fridman Podcast last year.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, the US Government has denied any confirmed encounters with UFOs or alien life. However, the recent resurgence of interest in UFOs, driven by whistleblower claims and public speculation, has prompted discussions about transparency and accountability. The documentary "The Age of Disclosure" claims to feature high-ranking officials discussing a cover-up that has lasted for 80 years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, all eyes will be on Trump to see if he follows through on his promises to disclose classified information regarding extraterrestrial life. If he does not act by the stipulated deadline, the validity of the bets placed on Polymarket will be affected.</p>
