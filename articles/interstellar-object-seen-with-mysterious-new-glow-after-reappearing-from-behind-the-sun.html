      <h2>'Interstellar object' seen with mysterious new glow after reappearing from behind the Sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been observed for the first time since it vanished behind the Sun, according to astronomer Dr. Qicheng Zhang at the Lowell Observatory. The sighting marks a significant moment in the study of celestial bodies that originate outside the Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it provides new insights into the nature of interstellar objects and their characteristics. Scientists aim to understand the composition and trajectory of 3I/ATLAS, which could enhance knowledge about the formation of planetary systems. The Lowell Observatory is continuing to monitor the object as it moves through space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First sighting since disappearance: not disclosed</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Lowell Observatory</li>
    <li>Observer: Dr. Qicheng Zhang</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified when it was visible, but it later disappeared from view as it passed behind the Sun. The exact date of its initial sighting and subsequent disappearance is not disclosed. The recent observation marks its return to visibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This sighting is a significant development in our understanding of interstellar objects,” said Dr. Qicheng Zhang.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this observation, 3I/ATLAS had sparked debate among scientists regarding its origins and physical properties. The study of interstellar objects has gained attention as more are detected, each providing unique data about the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Lowell Observatory will continue to track 3I/ATLAS to gather more information about its trajectory and composition in the coming weeks.</p>
