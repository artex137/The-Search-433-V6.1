      <h2>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS sheds water miles from the Sun—what does it mean for life beyond Earth?</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has released water vapour while located approximately 3.5 astronomical units from the Sun, according to researchers from NASA and Auburn University. This discovery marks the third recorded visitor from outside our solar system and has sparked interest in its potential implications for the origins of life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>This finding is significant for scientists studying the chemical composition of distant planetary systems. The detection of hydroxyl (OH) gas signals the presence of water vapour, which is essential for understanding comet activity. The research has been published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and highlights how 3I/ATLAS differs from previous interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS detected approximately 3.5 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Water vapour released at a rate of about 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>Discovery made by a team from Auburn University and NASA.</li>
    <li>Hydroxyl gas detected using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted in July and August 2025.</li>
    <li>ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS in early October 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation since its discovery, with significant findings emerging in July and August 2025. During this period, NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected hydroxyl gas, confirming the presence of water vapour. In early October 2025, the ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured images of the comet, revealing an expansive coma of gas and dust surrounding its nucleus.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we detect water—or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH—from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Professor Dennis Bodewits of Auburn University, emphasizing the potential for widespread chemistry necessary for life in the galaxy.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, displayed different characteristics. ‘Oumuamua appeared dry, while 2I/Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide. The unique behaviour of 3I/ATLAS, releasing water vapour at a distance where such activity is not typically observed, suggests complex structures within this comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations from both NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Researchers aim to further understand the comet's composition and its implications for the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>
