      <h2>3I/ATLAS is leaking water in space – Astronomers are stunned by interstellar comet</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed releasing water vapour into space, surprising astronomers and prompting new questions about comet behavior. This phenomenon occurs nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth, a region where ice typically remains solid. The discovery challenges traditional understandings of how comets behave and offers insights into the distribution of water and life-supporting materials across the galaxy.</p>

<p>The water emission from 3I/ATLAS is significant as it may provide clues about the origins of life on Earth. According to scientists, the comet's unusual properties and formation history could reshape existing models of comet behavior. Authorities, including global astronomers, are closely monitoring the comet as it approaches the Sun to gather more data on its water release mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is located nearly 3 times farther from the Sun than Earth.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object observed in our Solar System, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>At least 8% of ATLAS’s surface is actively releasing water vapour.</li>
    <li>The comet is rich in water but poor in cyanogen (CN).</li>
    <li>Observations are being conducted by astronomers worldwide using various telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected as it entered the Solar System, marking its arrival as the third known interstellar object. Observations have revealed that the comet began outgassing water vapour at a significant distance from the Sun, a behavior not typically seen in comets.</p>
<p>As scientists have studied the comet, they discovered that its surface properties allow for more efficient outgassing. This activity has prompted further investigation into the comet's internal structure and its implications for understanding planetary formation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of water in 3I/ATLAS is more than a scientific curiosity; it may help answer one of humanity’s greatest questions: how did life begin on Earth?” - Zexi Xing, lead researcher.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a broader trend of studying interstellar objects, which provide insights into the diversity of planetary systems. The comet’s unique composition and activity contrast with previous interstellar visitors, highlighting the complexity of cosmic materials and their potential role in the origins of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, gathering data to refine theories about comet behavior and the survival of volatile compounds in interstellar environments. Future missions may aim to intercept such objects for direct analysis of their materials.</p>
