      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS heads toward Earth as NASA fails to contact MAVEN</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2025, passing within 167 million miles of the planet. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This close encounter is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor and has drawn attention from NASA, which has been tracking the comet since its discovery in June 2025. The agency has been providing updates to the public about the comet's trajectory and characteristics. Following its close passage to Mars in October, NASA has faced challenges as it lost contact with the MAVEN spacecraft, which has been orbiting Mars since 2014. The agency has not been able to re-establish communication since MAVEN went offline on December 4.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will pass within 167 million miles of Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered in June 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA has been tracking 3I/ATLAS and providing updates.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to measure between 1,444 feet and 3.5 miles in diameter.</li>
    <li>NAVEN lost contact on December 4, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. The comet made its closest approach to Mars in October 2025. NASA has been monitoring the comet as it travels through the solar system, with updates shared with the public. On December 4, 2025, MAVEN lost contact with NASA, and the agency has been unable to re-establish communication since then.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is expected to move into interstellar space in the mid-2030s,” said Paul Chodas, director of NASA’s Center for Near Earth Objects Studies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a small group of interstellar objects that have entered our solar system. Earlier reports suggested that NASA activated a planetary defense mechanism amid speculation regarding the comet’s origin. However, it was later confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and investigate the loss of contact with MAVEN. The agency aims to restore communication with the spacecraft in the near future.</p>
