      <h2>NASA’s TESS Spots Rare Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS — New Data Target Its Spin</h2>

<p>NASA’s TESS spacecraft has captured new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS between January 15 and January 22, 2026. The comet, which is currently leaving the solar system, is one of only three known interstellar visitors.</p>

<p>This observation is significant because it allows scientists to analyze the comet's brightness variations, which can provide insights into its rotation and activity. As 3I/ATLAS dims and moves away from the Sun, researchers are racing to gather valuable data on its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed by TESS from January 15 to January 22, 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet's brightness is approximately 11.5 in apparent magnitude.</li>
    <li>TESS captured images of the comet after it was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>NASA’s TESS data from this observation period are publicly accessible through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.</li>
    <li>Other observatories, including Hubble and James Webb, have also imaged 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The TESS spacecraft went into "safe mode" during the observation period due to a solar-panel glitch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The following events outline the observations and discoveries related to comet 3I/ATLAS:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>July 1, 2025:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS is first observed by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li><strong>January 15-22, 2026:</strong> TESS captures a series of images of the comet, providing a close-up view of its activity.</li>
    <li><strong>January 15 and 18-19, 2026:</strong> Specific images are taken, although a gap in data occurs due to TESS entering "safe mode."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The spacecraft’s broad field of view allows it to identify and monitor comets and asteroids out to large distances,” said Daniel Muthukrishna, an MIT researcher involved in compiling the TESS images.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS ranks among the rare interstellar objects confirmed to have originated outside the solar system. The study of such comets is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of solar systems, including our own. Previous observations of 3I/ATLAS have been made by other telescopes, such as Hubble and James Webb, which adds to the wealth of data available for analysis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from TESS to track the light patterns of 3I/ATLAS. This will help determine the comet's spin and the intensity of its dust and gas emissions before it disappears from view.</p>
