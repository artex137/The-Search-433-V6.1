      <h2>Celebrity psychic says aliens from 3I-ATLAS are already here</h2>

<p>Israeli-British illusionist and self-described paranormal researcher Uri Geller has claimed that extraterrestrial beings linked to the interstellar comet 3I-ATLAS may already be present on Earth. Geller made the statement during an interview with the Daily Star, just days before the comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</p>

<p>The arrival of 3I-ATLAS has sparked widespread debate, with astronomers describing it as a rare visitor from beyond our solar system. Authorities, including NASA, have stated that the comet poses no known threat and is best explained by natural processes. However, Geller's claims have reignited interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I-ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>Uri Geller claims extraterrestrial beings linked to the comet are already observing humanity.</li>
    <li>NASA has consistently denied the existence of extraterrestrial bodies.</li>
    <li>Geller alleges he was shown alien bodies by Wernher von Braun decades ago.</li>
    <li>Geller believes the beings could help humanity avoid nuclear conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I-ATLAS was discovered as it made its way through the solar system, prompting interest from both scientists and the public. Geller's claims emerged shortly before the comet's closest approach, intensifying discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>In his interview, Geller reiterated a long-standing belief that the comet may be linked to a "Galactic Federation," a concept he has mentioned for years. He suggested that the beings associated with 3I-ATLAS could be monitoring humanity without revealing their presence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Perhaps they are already here, we just don’t know,” Geller said. “The sky really is the limit in terms of possibilities for this 3I-ATLAS spaceship.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It is likely that when it passes by they will give us something,” Geller stated. “We may not immediately know how to use whatever power they give us, but we will know in time.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The fascination with extraterrestrial life has deep roots in human history, from ancient myths to modern scientific inquiries. While many scientists remain skeptical, the idea of life beyond Earth continues to capture public imagination, particularly with the arrival of objects like 3I-ATLAS.</p>

<p>NASA has a long-standing policy of transparency regarding its research and findings. Despite Geller's claims, the agency maintains that there is no evidence to support the existence of extraterrestrial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I-ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and characteristics. Geller's claims are unlikely to prompt any official investigations, as NASA has stated that the comet poses no threat and is best explained by natural phenomena.</p>
