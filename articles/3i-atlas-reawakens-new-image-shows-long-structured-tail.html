      <h2>3I/ATLAS Reawakens: New Image Shows Long, Structured Tail</h2>

<p>A previously 'vanished' interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has reappeared with a longer and more structured tail, stunning astronomers worldwide. The new images were captured on 10 November 2025, by the Virtual Telescope Project in Italy, revealing a bright ion tail and complex dust structures, just weeks after the tail seemed to disappear entirely.</p>

<p>This reawakening of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it reignites curiosity about the comet's composition and behaviour. Researchers and amateur astronomers are now examining the mechanisms that led to this dramatic transformation. The renewed activity of the comet suggests a complex mix of volatile materials, prompting further analysis in the astrophysical community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reappeared on 10 November 2025.</li>
    <li>Images show a well-defined ion tail nearly 0.7 degrees across the sky.</li>
    <li>Images were captured by the Virtual Telescope Project in Italy.</li>
    <li>Dr Gianluca Masi leads the Virtual Telescope Project.</li>
    <li>The comet is projected to encounter Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object, initially surprised astronomers with the sudden disappearance of its tail earlier this year. The absence of the tail led to speculation about the comet's structure and material properties.</p>

<p>On 9 November 2025, amateur astronomers Michael Buechner and Frank Niebling produced images that revealed large-scale structures in the comet's dust environment. Their observations confirmed the comet's renewed activity just a day before the high-resolution images were released by the Virtual Telescope Project.</p>

<p>By 10 November 2025, the Virtual Telescope Project had compiled a composite image from 18 long-exposure frames, showcasing the comet's strikingly luminous ion tail and additional features.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We imaged the interstellar comet again, recording a much more developed ion tail. Each observation shows it better and better.” - Dr Gianluca Masi, head of the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If confirmed, it will be the third known interstellar object, providing more evidence that such interstellar wanderers are relatively common in our galaxy.” - Mark Norris, professor at the University of Central Lancashire.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the earlier discoveries of interstellar objects 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These findings have provided valuable insights into materials formed around distant stars. The unpredictable behaviour of 3I/ATLAS challenges previous assumptions about interstellar objects and their responses to solar radiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct coordinated observations across professional and amateur observatories to track 3I/ATLAS as it moves towards its encounter with Jupiter in March 2026. Continued analysis of the comet's behaviour will enhance understanding of volatile-rich interstellar bodies.</p>
