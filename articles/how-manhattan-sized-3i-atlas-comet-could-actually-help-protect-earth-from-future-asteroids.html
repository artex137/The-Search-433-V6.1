      <h2>Comet 31/ATLAS Could Help Protect Earth from Future Asteroids</h2>

<p>Researchers have stated that the Manhattan-sized comet 31/ATLAS could provide vital information for tracking potentially hazardous objects in the future. The comet is currently passing through our solar system and will depart on January 27, 2026. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this event.</p>

<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has initiated a “comet campaign” from November 27, 2025, through January 27, 2026, to track 31/ATLAS. This initiative aims to refine methods for monitoring comets and asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth. Authorities emphasize the importance of this research, as it could improve our capability to predict the trajectories of such objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 31/ATLAS is approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>It will depart our solar system on January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>The IAWN's comet campaign runs from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>IAWN is urging citizen scientists to register by November 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>31/ATLAS will pass at a distance of roughly 1.8 sun-Earth distances.</li>
    <li>Nasa has stated that 31/ATLAS does not pose a threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 31/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. Since then, researchers have been monitoring its trajectory and characteristics. The IAWN has launched its comet campaign to track the object more closely as it approaches its closest point to Earth.</p>

<p>During the campaign, experts will hold workshops on techniques for measuring comet astrometry, which is essential for estimating the brightness and trajectory of comets. This information is crucial for predicting the potential risk of future objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The hypothesis in question is that [31/ATLAS] is a technological artifact, and furthermore has active intelligence,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist who has raised concerns about the comet's unusual characteristics.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>31/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to enter our solar system. Previous incidents involving comets and asteroids have raised awareness about the potential dangers they pose to Earth. The IAWN was established to improve global monitoring and response strategies for such threats.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will continue its monitoring efforts through January 2026. Researchers will analyze data collected during the comet campaign to enhance future tracking methods for hazardous objects.</p>
