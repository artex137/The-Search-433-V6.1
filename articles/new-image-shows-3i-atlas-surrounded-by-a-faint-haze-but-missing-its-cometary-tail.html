      <h2>New image shows 3I/ATLAS surrounded by a faint haze but missing its cometary tail</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, captured on November 5, 2025, by the Lowell Discovery Telescope in Arizona, reveal the object surrounded by a faint haze but lacking a cometary tail. The images were taken when 3I/ATLAS was at a distance of 1.38 astronomical units (au) from the Sun and 2.23 au from Earth.</p>

<p>This new information is significant as it raises questions about the object's composition and behaviour as it approaches perihelion. Researchers, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, are analyzing the findings and awaiting further data from NASA to understand the implications of the missing tail.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images captured on November 5, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance of 3I/ATLAS from the Sun: 1.38 au</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 2.23 au</li>
    <li>Created by the Lowell Discovery Telescope, Arizona</li>
    <li>Researcher: Qicheng Zhang, postdoctoral fellow at Lowell Observatory</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb published findings on November 7, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 5, 2025, the Lowell Discovery Telescope captured new images of 3I/ATLAS. The images revealed a faint glow around the interstellar object but showed no clear evidence of a cometary tail. On November 7, 2025, Avi Loeb published a blog post discussing the implications of these findings.</p>
<p>Loeb noted that while the images showed a faint atmosphere, they did not provide evidence of a dust tail, which is typically expected from a comet as it approaches the Sun. He also mentioned that the perspective of the images could be affecting the visibility of the tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The atmosphere was viewed with a green filter, optimized to detect diatomic carbon molecules (C2). It is brightest in the bluest filter,” said Avi Loeb in his blog post.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “As far as we know, the comet just 'changed color' once when its gas coma first became visible/bright, and it's still like that now (only brighter),” stated Qicheng Zhang.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The absence of a cometary tail in the latest images of 3I/ATLAS contrasts with typical comet behaviour, where a tail is expected to develop as the object nears the Sun. Previous reports from NASA's JPL indicated non-gravitational acceleration for 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it should lose a significant amount of mass during perihelion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers and space enthusiasts are awaiting NASA’s release of high-resolution HiRISE images obtained on October 2-3, 2025, which may provide further insights into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and its potential cometary features.</p>
