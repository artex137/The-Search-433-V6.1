      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Confirmed as Natural, but Its Long Journey Comes With a Big Catch</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that the recently discovered 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, not an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The announcement follows significant interest since astronomers first spotted the object on 1 July 2025, as it travelled through our Solar System.</p>

<p>This confirmation is important for understanding interstellar objects. NASA's lead scientist for Solar System small bodies, Tom Statler, emphasized that while the comet has intriguing properties, the evidence overwhelmingly points to it being a natural body. Further research is ongoing to explore the comet's unusual chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Interstellar, third visitor after 1I/&#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> High ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) to water (H2O)</li>
    <li><strong>CO2/H2O Ratio:</strong> 7.6 ± 0.3</li>
    <li><strong>Research Team:</strong> Astronomers from Belgium and the USA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) detected 3I/ATLAS. Subsequent observations confirmed it as a comet characterized by a distinct coma of ice and dust, as well as a rare 'anti-tail'.</p>
<p>Recent studies revealed that the comet has an unusual chemical makeup, particularly a high ratio of CO2 to H2O, prompting scientists to explore various hypotheses regarding its formation and evolution.</p>
<p>A research team proposed that galactic cosmic rays may have altered the comet's surface over billions of years, complicating the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,”</blockquote>
<p>- Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for Solar System small bodies.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit our Solar System, following 1I/&#699;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous studies of these objects have provided insights into the formation of solar systems and the materials that comprise them. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS complicate the understanding of such interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations are required to confirm the theories surrounding 3I/ATLAS. Telescopes worldwide are currently monitoring the comet, and there is a slim chance that pristine material could be outgassed as it approaches the Sun.</p>
