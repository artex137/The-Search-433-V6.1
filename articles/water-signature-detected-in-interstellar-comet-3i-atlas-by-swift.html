      <h2>Water signature detected in interstellar comet 3I ATLAS by Swift</h2>

<p>NASA's Swift satellite has detected a water signature in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, located nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth, during observations made in mid-October 2023.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it demonstrates the capability of Swift's ultraviolet measurements, which ground telescopes cannot replicate. The findings suggest that the comet is losing water at a rate of approximately 40 kilograms per second, indicating an unusual mechanism for its water outflow. Researchers aim to understand the comet's behavior as it approaches the Sun, which will help link it to the broader comet family and its original star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed in mid-October 2023.</li>
    <li>It was located nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth.</li>
    <li>The water-loss rate is approximately 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>Swift's observations utilized a 30 cm space telescope.</li>
    <li>Results were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In mid-October 2023, Swift captured the faint OH glow from comet 3I/ATLAS, marking the first detection of water activity at such a distance. Researchers noted that most solar-system comets remain inactive at this range, suggesting an extraordinary mechanism driving the comet's water outflow.</p>
<p>Following these observations, scientists plan to monitor the comet's activity as it approaches the Sun, which is expected to occur after mid-November 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"When we detect water - or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH - from an interstellar comet, we're reading a note from another planetary system," said Dennis Bodewits.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"'Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn't expect it," said lead author Zexi Xing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar visitors, each providing unique chemical insights into their origins. Previous comets, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have shown different compositions, highlighting the diversity of materials present in different star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS after mid-November 2023 to track changes in its water activity and better understand its characteristics as it approaches the Sun.</p>
