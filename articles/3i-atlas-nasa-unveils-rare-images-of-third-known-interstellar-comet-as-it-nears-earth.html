      <h2>3I/ATLAS: NASA unveils rare images of third-known interstellar comet as it nears Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, as it approaches Earth. The images were captured by twelve NASA assets, including various spacecraft and telescopes, while the comet passed Mars earlier this year.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as scientists aim to understand how the composition of 3I/ATLAS differs from comets formed around the Sun. NASA plans to share more images in the future to aid in this research. The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered by NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth scheduled for December 19 at about 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>Images captured by twelve NASA assets, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN.</li>
    <li>Comet monitored by STEREO spacecraft from September 11 to October 2.</li>
    <li>ESA–NASA SOHO mission observed the comet from October 15 to October 26.</li>
    <li>Psyche spacecraft captured images from 33 million miles away on September 8 and 9.</li>
    <li>Lucy spacecraft took pictures from 240 million miles away on September 15.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured detailed images of 3I/ATLAS as the comet passed Mars at a distance of around 19 million miles earlier this year. The Psyche spacecraft took several photos from a distance of approximately 33 million miles on September 8 and 9. Following that, the Lucy spacecraft captured images from 240 million miles away on September 15.</p>
<p>The comet was monitored by the STEREO spacecraft from September 11 to October 2, followed by observations from the ESA–NASA SOHO mission from October 15 to October 26. NASA’s recently launched PUNCH mission captured the comet’s tail in late September and early October.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We've just released the latest images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, as observed by eight different spacecraft, satellites, and telescopes,” NASA stated in a blog post.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov. The initial discovery of 3I/ATLAS by the ATLAS survey telescope has prompted further observations from notable instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA intends to continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves outward, with plans to observe it as it passes through Jupiter’s orbit in spring 2026.</p>
