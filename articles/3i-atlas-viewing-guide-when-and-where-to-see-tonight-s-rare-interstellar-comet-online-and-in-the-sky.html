      <h2>3I/ATLAS Viewing Guide: When And Where To See Tonight’s Rare Interstellar Comet Online And In The Sky</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object ever discovered, will pass closest to Earth between Thursday and Friday, December 18–19, 2025. The comet will be approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) away from Earth at its closest point, expected at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on December 19, according to Space.com. The comet poses no threat to Earth and offers a unique opportunity for astronomers and skywatchers to observe an object that originated beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks one of the last good opportunities to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS, which was first discovered in July 2025. The comet is currently traveling away from the Sun and will eventually exit the solar system. Authorities encourage the public to engage in this rare astronomical event through various viewing options.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025, at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Livestream start time:</strong> 11 p.m. EST on December 18 (0400 GMT on December 19)</li>
    <li><strong>Location in the sky:</strong> Constellation Leo</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness magnitude:</strong> Approximately 11</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025. It follows the earlier detections of 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. As it approaches Earth, astronomers have noted its trajectory away from the Sun, indicating it will soon exit the solar system.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth at 1 a.m. EST on December 19, 2025. Before this, a livestream of the comet will be available starting at 11 p.m. EST on December 18, providing an opportunity for widespread viewing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Comet 3I/ATLAS offers a rare and fascinating reminder of how dynamic and interconnected our universe truly is," said a NASA spokesperson. "This close approach is a moment worth watching and remembering."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as the third interstellar object discovered, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These discoveries indicate a growing interest in and understanding of interstellar objects, prompting further study and observation by astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its close approach, astronomers will continue to study Comet 3I/ATLAS. NASA has already released new ultraviolet images captured by the Europa Clipper spacecraft, with additional data expected in the coming days.</p>
