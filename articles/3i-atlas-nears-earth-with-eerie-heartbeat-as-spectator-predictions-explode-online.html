      <h2>3I/ATLAS Nears Earth With Eerie 'Heartbeat'</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn public attention as it approaches Earth, exhibiting a unique pulsing pattern that astronomers describe as a steady heartbeat. New telescope data shows the comet brightening and dimming in a 16.16-hour rhythm, with the next close approach scheduled for December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</p>

<p>This unusual behaviour has prompted a mix of excitement and concern among astronomers and the public. NASA and the United Nations have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no danger to Earth. However, planetary defence teams have initiated formal surveillance to monitor the comet closely, amid ongoing discussions about its characteristics and potential implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Brightening and dimming cycle: 16.16 hours</li>
    <li>Next close approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Predicted jet speed: 985 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Material ejected: up to 15,900 miles from the surface</li>
    <li>Surveillance initiated: November 27, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The peculiar behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has been observed in recent months. A scientific study released in August 2025 first identified the comet's unique heartbeat pattern. As it approaches Earth, astronomers have noted that the surface ice pockets heat up during each rotation, leading to gas jets erupting. NASA has attributed this behaviour to foreign chemistry from a distant solar system.</p>

<p>On November 27, 2025, planetary defence teams began formal surveillance of the comet, with support from the Asteroid Warning Network. As the date of closest approach nears, experts continue to monitor the comet's characteristics and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behaviour of 3I/ATLAS is fascinating, but it poses no danger to Earth,” said a NASA spokesperson. “We are monitoring it closely to understand its unique properties.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard Professor Avi Loeb noted, “Typical comets show around 5% brightening. The variations we see in 3I/ATLAS are unusual and warrant further investigation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is not the first comet to capture public and scientific interest. Previous comets have exhibited irregular behaviours, often leading to speculation about their origins and potential risks. NASA and other space agencies routinely monitor near-Earth objects to ensure planetary safety.</p>

<p>The unique heartbeat pattern of 3I/ATLAS has sparked discussions about the comet's composition and behaviour, especially in comparison to typical comets that display more predictable patterns.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to observe it closely. Ongoing studies aim to better understand its behaviour and characteristics, while the planetary defence teams remain vigilant to ensure there is no risk to Earth.</p>
