      <h2>NASA Prepares Major 3I/ATLAS Disclosure; Multi-Platform Imagery to Address Months of Speculation</h2>

<p>NASA will reveal new imagery of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on November 19 at 3 p.m. EST at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. This event aims to clarify months of speculation surrounding the comet, which has been fueled by amateur observations and halted data releases.</p>

<p>The upcoming livestream is significant as it marks the first comprehensive official review of 3I/ATLAS since its discovery. NASA has stated that their distributed mission assets allow for continuous observation of the comet, providing a unique opportunity to study its behavior as it passes through the solar system. The agency has not disclosed specific details about the additional instruments contributing imagery, but scientific observers anticipate involvement from the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> November 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Time:</strong> 3 p.m. EST</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> No closer than 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> Within 19 million miles in early October</li>
    <li><strong>Streaming platforms:</strong> NASA+, NASA app, website, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2023, by the NASA-funded ATLAS observatory. Since then, it has been a subject of intense scrutiny due to its unique status as only the third object identified entering the solar system from elsewhere in the galaxy. In early October, the comet flew within 19 million miles of Mars, providing an unusual observational opportunity.</p>
<p>In the months leading up to the November 19 event, communication from NASA has been limited, despite increasing public interest and independent analyses suggesting unusual behavior of the comet. The upcoming livestream will serve as a platform to address these speculations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our distributed mission assets give the United States the unique capability to observe 3I/ATLAS almost the entire time it passes through our celestial neighbourhood.” - NASA</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will get no closer than 170 million miles.” - NASA</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest among both amateur and professional astronomers since its discovery. The comet's behavior has been a topic of discussion, especially following independent spectral analyses indicating a lack of expected outgassing. The unusual dust-emission patterns observed have further fueled public engagement and speculation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will present the findings from the upcoming livestream and address the questions submitted by the public. This event marks a critical opportunity to compare official scientific data with independent observations and analyses.</p>
