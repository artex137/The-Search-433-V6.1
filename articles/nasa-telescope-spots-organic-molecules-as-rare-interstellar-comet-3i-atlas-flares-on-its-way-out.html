      <h2>NASA telescope spots organic molecules as rare interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS flares on its way out</h2>

<p>NASA's SPHEREx space telescope has detected organic molecules around interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which brightened sharply in December 2025 after its closest approach to the Sun. The comet poses no threat to Earth as it continues its trajectory out of the solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it contributes to understanding the chemical composition of interstellar objects and the ingredients for planet formation and potential life. Scientists have a limited timeframe to study 3I/ATLAS before it fades into deep space, with observations crucial to grasping the evolution of comets from other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of brightening:</strong> December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest solar approach:</strong> Late October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Gases detected:</strong> Methanol, methane, cyanide, water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmed interstellar objects:</strong> Three, including 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's telescope used:</strong> SPHEREx</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile first reported the existence of comet 3I/ATLAS. Subsequent observations included earlier data from other ATLAS sites and Caltech's Zwicky Transient Facility. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun in late October 2025, leading to significant changes in its brightness.</p>

<p>In December 2025, SPHEREx observed the comet's brightening, capturing infrared data that identified various gases surrounding it. This surge in brightness indicated a burst of activity as the comet continued its journey away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025 … causing it to significantly brighten,” said Carey Lisse, a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory involved in the SPHEREx work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Phil Korngut, SPHEREx instrument scientist at Caltech, noted that the delayed flare-up fits a picture where the Sun’s heat takes time to punch through an outer crust altered by long exposure to cosmic radiation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed in the solar system. This limited sample size presents challenges for scientists aiming to compare the composition of comets across different star systems. Understanding the chemistry of such comets can provide insights into the building blocks of planets and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the solar system, utilising multiple instruments to gather data before the comet fades from view. The findings will contribute to ongoing research into the composition of interstellar objects.</p>
