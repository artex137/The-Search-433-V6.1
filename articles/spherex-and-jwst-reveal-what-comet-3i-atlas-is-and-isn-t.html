      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Revealed by SPHEREx and JWST</h2>

<p>Astronomers have identified new details about comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, since its discovery in early July 2025. The comet, which is currently moving through the Solar System, is the largest and fastest-moving interstellar object detected to date, showing a bright coma but lacking a tail. Observations from the SPHEREx space telescope have provided insights into its characteristics.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for understanding interstellar objects and their origins. The observations have allowed scientists to determine that 3I/ATLAS has an unprecedented eccentricity of 6.2, indicating it is on a hyperbolic trajectory and will exit the Solar System. The data collected will enhance knowledge about the formation and evolution of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: Early July 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Currently in the Solar System</li>
    <li>Estimated size: Approximately 2.7 kilometers in radius</li>
    <li>Speed: 58 km/s, the fastest recorded for an interstellar object</li>
    <li>Eccentricity: 6.2, indicating a hyperbolic orbit</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): Late October 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed in early July 2025. Initial images showed a large, bright coma but no discernible tail. As the object approached the Sun, astronomers utilized various telescopes, including Hubble, SPHEREx, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), to gather data.</p>

<p>On July 21, 2025, Hubble captured images showing a nucleus embedded within a diffuse coma. The JWST observed 3I/ATLAS on August 6, 2025, providing detailed spectral data. These observations have helped refine estimates of its size and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The nucleus at most is about 2.7 kilometers in radius, comparable to the asteroid believed to have caused the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs,” a scientist noted regarding the findings from Hubble observations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified since 2017, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Each discovery has increased understanding of objects from beyond the Solar System, with 3I/ATLAS exhibiting unique features compared to its predecessors.</p>

<p>Prior interstellar objects have provided insights into their origins, with 3I/ATLAS believed to originate from the Milky Way's thick disk, an area rich in new stars and star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion, astronomers will continue to monitor the object. Observations will be limited after late October 2025 as Earth will be on the opposite side of the Sun, but further data is expected in November and December.</p>
