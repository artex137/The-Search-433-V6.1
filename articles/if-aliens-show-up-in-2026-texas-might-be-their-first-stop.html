      <h2>If Aliens Show Up in 2026, Texas Might Be Their First Stop</h2>

<p>A study has ranked Texas as the fifth-most likely U.S. state to make first contact with extraterrestrial life, according to research by Duelbits. The study was released in October 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to UFO sightings in the region.</p>

<p>This ranking highlights Texas's potential role in future extraterrestrial encounters. Authorities and researchers have noted factors that contribute to this likelihood, including the state's UFO reporting density and proximity to military facilities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Texas is ranked fifth among U.S. states for potential first contact with aliens.</li>
  <li>Other states in the top five include New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, and California.</li>
  <li>Factors considered in the study include UFO reporting density and proximity to military or aerospace facilities.</li>
  <li>The study was conducted by Duelbits in October 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2023, Duelbits released a study analyzing the likelihood of first contact with extraterrestrial life in U.S. states. Texas was identified as the fifth-most likely state for such an event.</p>

<p>Researchers evaluated four key factors that contributed to their findings, including UFO reporting density and the state's cultural significance regarding UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Researchers based their findings on four main factors: UFO or UAP reporting density, proximity to military or aerospace facilities, population distribution, and how deeply a state features in existing UFO culture.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Texas has a history of UFO sightings, which has contributed to its presence in UFO culture. The state's vast landscape and military installations may attract attention from unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UFOs continues to grow, further studies and investigations into sightings in Texas and other states may occur in the coming years.</p>
