      <h2>3I/ATLAS: NASA's AMA Tweet On The Interstellar Comet Before They Release Images Triggers Hilarious Memefest</h2>

<p>NASA's interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked a wave of memes and skepticism on social media following the agency's announcement of a live event to release images of the comet. The event is scheduled for 1:30 a.m. on November 20, 2025, after the comet was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS facility in Chile.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unusual characteristics, which have led some experts to speculate about its potential extraterrestrial origins. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has requested images of the comet, which have not yet been released. NASA has attributed the delay to the recent U.S. government shutdown, which has impacted the agency's ability to communicate effectively with the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The live event will take place at 1:30 a.m. EST on November 20, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA has not disclosed the number of anomalies reported by Prof. Loeb.</li>
    <li>NASA assets observing the comet include Hubble, Webb, TESS, Swift, and others.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to leave the solar system on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS facility in Chile. Since then, it has exhibited properties that differ from typical comets. In November 2025, NASA announced a live event to release images of 3I/ATLAS, which have not been shared due to a government shutdown. The announcement prompted a humorous response on social media, with users creating memes and expressing skepticism about the agency's transparency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA urged social media users to drop their queries for the upcoming live event.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The recent U.S. government shutdown has hampered NASA’s ability to release information on the comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time a space agency has faced scrutiny over the transparency of its findings. Previous incidents involving the release of astronomical data have led to public skepticism and speculation. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have only intensified these discussions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is set to release the long-awaited images of 3I/ATLAS during the live event on November 20. The agency will also address questions from the public, which may help clarify the comet's mysterious features and quell ongoing speculation.</p>
