      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet to reach closest point to the Sun today, but will you be able to see it?</h2>

<p>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun today, October 30, 2025, but it will not be visible from Earth. The comet, which has intrigued many due to its origins beyond our solar system, remains obscured by the Sun's bright light, according to reports.</p>

<p>This comet is significant because it is the third known object from outside the solar system to pass through our cosmic neighborhood. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no danger to Earth, as it will remain at a safe distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 270 million kilometers, from our planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
<li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
<li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (270 million kilometers)</li>
<li><strong>Closest Distance to the Sun:</strong> 1.4 astronomical units, just inside Mars' orbit</li>
<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Not visible due to solar conjunction</li>
<li><strong>Next Visibility:</strong> Expected reappearance by early December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has captured significant interest since its discovery. Astronomers identified it as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic orbit, indicating it does not follow a circular path like traditional comets. The comet was visible through ground telescopes until September 2025, after which it entered solar conjunction, making it invisible from Earth.</p>
<p>As it approaches the Sun today, it will not be observable by astronomers or the public. However, it is expected to reappear on the other side of the Sun by early December 2025, allowing for further study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa has confirmed that Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no danger to Earth and will remain at a safe distance.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of the rare interstellar objects to visit our solar system. Its hyperbolic orbit distinguishes it from typical comets, which usually follow elliptical paths. The rarity of such visitors has heightened interest among scientists and space enthusiasts alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach today, astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, with hopes of observing it once it becomes visible again in December 2025.</p>
