      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals unprecedented anomalies in image captured by Japanese astronomer</h2>

<p>Japanese astronomer Mitsunori Tsumura has captured an image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on November 22, 2025, showcasing unique characteristics that differ from typical comets. The image was taken using a 0.5-meter telescope, revealing a fine and collimated ionic and dust tail.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about comet behavior and composition. Experts are currently analyzing the image, which indicates that the tail does not scatter as expected under solar radiation or wind. The findings may lead to new insights into the materials that make up interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: November 22, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observation: not disclosed</li>
    <li>Telescope used: 0.5-meter</li>
    <li>Diameter of 3I/ATLAS: maximum of 5.6 km</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun during observation: 1.4 AU</li>
    <li>Close passage to Jupiter: 53.5 million km, expected in 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS project in Chile. It passed 1.4 AU from the Sun in October and came close to Mars, allowing for multiple observations. Preliminary data from missions such as Lucy and Psyche were captured in September, revealing a teardrop-shaped dust envelope around the comet.</p>
<p>On November 22, Tsumura released the image that sparked further analysis and discussions among astronomers regarding the comet's unusual features.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The tail maintains linear rigidity, which is unlike common comets where tails broaden with distance,” said astronomers observing the data.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The absence of curvature in the tail reinforces the debate about its composition and suggests possible non-gravitational acceleration,” noted a researcher involved in the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov, have shown scattering in their tails. The unique linearity of 3I/ATLAS raises questions about the physical processes at play. Observations indicate that solar winds typically disperse gas and dust, creating broad plumes, but this comet exhibits a straight and uniform tail.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to analyze the data from 3I/ATLAS to better understand its composition and behavior. Ongoing observations will focus on its trajectory and any potential non-gravitational accelerations that may affect its path as it approaches Jupiter in 2026.</p>
