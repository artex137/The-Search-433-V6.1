      <h2>Scientists baffled as interstellar visitor appears to reverse thrust before vanishing behind the sun</h2>

<p>Astronomers have reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has performed a dramatic tail reversal, now pointing away from the sun, as it moves behind the sun, rendering ground-based observations impossible. The changes have been observed since July 2025, with new data confirming this shift in the comet's behavior.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it challenges previous understandings of comet behavior and raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Researchers from the University of California and the University of Oslo are analyzing this unusual activity to better understand the comet's composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has reversed its tail direction, now pointing away from the sun.</li>
    <li>New observations confirm a transition from an 'anti-tail' to a classic tail.</li>
    <li>The comet is shedding material at a rate of approximately 150 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The mass lost from 3I/ATLAS amounts to about two million tons since July 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA has detected the comet losing about 330 pounds (150 kilograms) of material per second, primarily carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS measures approximately 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers observed an 'anti-tail' from 3I/ATLAS, with dust particles scattering light towards the sun. By September 2025, this anti-tail transformed into a classic tail pointing away from the sun as the comet approached perihelion.</p>
<p>As of October 2025, 3I/ATLAS has moved behind the sun, making it invisible to ground-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor, stated, "The total amount of mass lost from 3I/ATLAS during July through October 2025 amounts to about two million tons." He added, "Needless to say, we cannot infer the true nature of 3I/ATLAS from the skin layer that it has shed so far."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike 1I/`Oumuamua, which showed no signs of gas or dust, 3I/ATLAS exhibits unique features, including an anti-tail and significant color changes. Its behavior has drawn interest from scientists seeking to understand more about interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible again after passing behind the sun. Further studies will aim to clarify the comet's composition and the implications of its unusual tail behavior.</p>
