      <h2>Man dies from H5N5 bird flu; Comet ATLAS disintegrating</h2>

<p>A Washington state resident has died after being infected with the H5N5 strain of bird flu, according to CNN. The individual, an older adult with underlying health conditions, had kept a backyard flock of mixed domestic birds, which state health officials believe is the likely source of the infection.</p>

<p>This case marks the first known human infection of the H5N5 strain, although health authorities do not consider it a greater public health threat than the H5N1 virus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported around 70 human infections from H5N1 in the U.S. between 2024 and 2025, primarily affecting poultry and dairy farm workers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First human infection of H5N5 reported in Washington state.</li>
    <li>Victim had underlying health conditions.</li>
    <li>Infection source believed to be a backyard flock of mixed domestic birds.</li>
    <li>Approximately 70 reported human infections of H5N1 in the U.S. since 2024.</li>
    <li>Comet ATLAS (C/2025 K1) has been observed disintegrating after a close approach to the sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The patient, whose identity has not been disclosed, was reported to have developed complications from the H5N5 virus. This case was confirmed by state health officials, who noted the individual’s connection to a backyard bird flock.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, scientists have tracked the disintegration of Comet ATLAS, which was initially thought to have survived its recent close encounter with the sun. Observations from The Virtual Telescope project have shown that the comet has broken into three brighter fragments due to the sun's gravitational pull.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While this first infection of the H5N5 is notable, it’s not believed to be a greater threat to human health than the H5N1 virus,” state health officials said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Photographer Michael Jäger stated, “The comet’s disintegration is likely the consequence of the sun’s powerful gravitational pull.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The H5N5 strain is part of a family of avian influenza viruses that have been monitored for potential human health impacts. The H5N1 virus has caused a wave of infections primarily among those in close contact with infected birds, with most cases resulting in mild illness.</p>

<p>Comet ATLAS, unrelated to the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, has been a subject of interest for scientists, particularly regarding its behavior during close solar encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Health authorities continue to monitor the situation concerning H5N5 and advise the public on prevention measures. Observations of Comet ATLAS will continue as scientists analyze its disintegration and the implications for future comet studies.</p>
