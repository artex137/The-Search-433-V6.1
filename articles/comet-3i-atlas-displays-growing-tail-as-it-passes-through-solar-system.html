      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Displays Growing Tail as It Passes Through Solar System</h2>

<p>A newly captured image shows the growing tail of comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. The image was taken on August 27 during a public outreach event at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this event.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to traverse our solar system. NASA has confirmed that it poses no threat to Earth. The comet has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July, with recent images highlighting its distinct features.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The recent image was taken on August 27, 2023, at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October 2023.</li>
    <li>The tail of the comet spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky.</li>
    <li>NASA and the European Space Agency have shared images of the comet taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to remain visible through September 2023.</li>
    <li>Only two other interstellar comets have been confirmed prior to 3I/ATLAS: 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its discovery in July 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed multiple times. The first significant images were shared by NASA and the European Space Agency in early August when the comet was approximately 277 million miles from Earth. The latest images taken on August 27 show the comet's tail and distinct coma.</p>
<p>NASA expects the comet to make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between Mars and Earth. After this, it will become too close to the sun for observation but is anticipated to reemerge in early December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder. It reminds us that our Solar System is just one part of a vast and dynamic galaxy — and that even the most fleeting visitors can leave a lasting impact," said Karen Meech, an astronomer at the University of Hawai'i Institute for Astronomy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are exceedingly rare, with only two confirmed prior to 3I/ATLAS. The first, 1I/'Oumuamua, was discovered in 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019. These encounters provide valuable insights into the composition and behavior of celestial objects from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun and will analyze the spectral data collected during the observatory session. This data will help scientists understand the comet's composition and evolution while it travels through the solar system.</p>
