      <h2>Private Contractor Admits To New Jersey UFO Scare</h2>

<p>A private defense contractor has admitted to conducting aerial tests over New Jersey in November 2024, clarifying the mysterious UFO and drone sightings that sparked widespread alarm. The contractor showcased a 20-foot manned aerial craft at the Army’s UAS Summit in Fort Rucker, Alabama, on August 12, 2025, which puzzled military experts with its flight patterns.</p>

<p>This admission has drawn attention to the lack of transparency surrounding military contracts involving experimental aircraft. Authorities have stated that there was no credible national security threat from the sightings, but the incident has raised questions about oversight in private government operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of aerial tests: November 2024</li>
    <li>Date of contractor's admission: August 12, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of demonstration: Fort Rucker, Alabama</li>
    <li>Size of aerial craft: 20 feet with four wings</li>
    <li>Duration of demonstration: 30 minutes</li>
    <li>Number of sightings reported: Hundreds</li>
    <li>Agency involved: U.S. Army</li>
    <li>Status of contractor: Not disclosed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 13, 2024, numerous reports of unidentified flying objects began to surface over Picatinny Arsenal, an Army base in Morris County, New Jersey. Over the following weeks, sightings spread across the state and into neighboring regions, with videos and eyewitness accounts describing unusual flying objects.</p>

<p>Months later, on August 12, 2025, the unnamed private contractor demonstrated a unique aerial craft at the Army’s UAS Summit at Fort Rucker. An employee of the contractor revealed to attendees that the UFO sightings were the result of their testing activities conducted in New Jersey.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” an employee of the contractor said, according to an attendee of the summit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Authorities have tried to ease public concerns by insisting they present no national security risk,” a report from Daily Star stated regarding the government’s response.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The UFO sightings in New Jersey have generated a variety of conspiracy theories, with some speculating that the objects were linked to hostile foreign nations or even a government plot. The Federal Aviation Administration later reported that many sightings were attributed to hobbyists and recreational pilots, but this did not quell the more imaginative rumors.</p>

<p>The Army has not commented on the incidents, citing an ongoing federal government shutdown at the time. The identity of the private contractor remains undisclosed pending further investigation, highlighting concerns about the oversight of private government contracts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the contractor’s activities are ongoing. Authorities continue to emphasize that there is no evidence the sightings posed a threat to public safety or national security. Further discussions on the transparency and oversight of such operations are expected as the situation develops.</p>
