      <h2>What's this about the intergalactic 3I/Atlas, Earth and December? Here's what we know</h2>

<p>A new interstellar comet, 3I/Atlas, has captured the attention of skywatchers since it was first spotted in July. The comet, which scientists believe originated from a disk around another star, is expected to pass Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/Atlas lies in its status as the third known interstellar object from outside our solar system. Researchers at NASA and various universities are monitoring its trajectory and characteristics to learn more about its origins and composition. The comet has generated interest due to its potential implications for understanding celestial objects and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> October 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Earth Flyby:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Flyby:</strong> Approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Believed to be from outside the solar system</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Scientists:</strong> Levent Gurdemir (University of Texas at Arlington), Dr. Avi Loeb (Harvard University)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first reported on July 1, 2023, by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile. Prior discoveries related to the comet date back to June 14. It reached its closest point to Mars in October 2023, and its trajectory is set to bring it near Earth in December 2025.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches the sun, its tail has become more visible, which has sparked increased interest and speculation among scientists and the public alike.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/Atlas, as much as we can tell so far, is a comet coming from outside of the solar system,” said Levent Gurdemir, an astrophysicist at the University of Texas at Arlington.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We think about existential threats from artificial intelligence, from global climate change, from an asteroid impact, but we don't discuss alien technology,” Dr. Avi Loeb stated, emphasizing the importance of curiosity in science.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas follows the identification of other interstellar objects, including 1I Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I Borisov in 2019. These previous encounters have prompted discussions on the nature of interstellar visitors and their potential implications for understanding our universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches the sun and later Earth. Images of its tail are expected to emerge, and researchers will analyze data to further understand its characteristics and origins. The comet is anticipated to leave our solar system in March 2024.</p>
