      <h2>Earth is Now Picking Up Radio Signals from 3I/Atlas Interstellar Object</h2>

<p>The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa has started to receive radio signals from the interstellar object 3I/Atlas, which is currently traveling through our solar system. The signals were detected on November 11, 2025, as the object approaches Earth, expected to come closest in mid-December.</p>

<p>This development has heightened interest among scientists and the public regarding the nature of 3I/Atlas. Authorities and researchers are analyzing the signals, which provide insights into the object's composition and behavior. The signals detected are linked to the outgassing of water from the comet, although some experts, including Avi Loeb of Harvard University, have raised questions about the possibility of it being an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of signal detection: November 11, 2025</li>
    <li>Location of telescope: Near Carnarvon, Northern Cape, South Africa</li>
    <li>Signal frequency: 1665-1667 MHz</li>
    <li>Object speed: 140,000 mph relative to the Sun</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth when detected: 325 million miles</li>
    <li>Object discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Object prefix: 3I, following 1I (Oumuamua) and 2I (Borisov)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Initial observations indicated it was on a highly eccentric trajectory that could bring it close to Earth’s orbit. As it entered the inner solar system, it was identified as the third confirmed interstellar object.</p>

<p>On November 11, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected radio signals from the object, which were linked to the outgassing of water. Scientists are now analyzing the signals for more information about the object's nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The radio signal likely reflects the usual outgassing of water from an ordinary comet,” said Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University. “However, the new imagery raises questions about whether this object might actually be something more.” 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas follows two previous interstellar objects, Oumuamua and Borisov. The detection of radio signals from an interstellar object is significant for understanding the characteristics of such bodies and their interactions with solar radiation.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has been vocal about the potential implications of 3I/Atlas, suggesting that its features may indicate advanced technology rather than natural phenomena. His work and publications have drawn attention to the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Upcoming spectroscopic observations are planned to better understand the velocity, mass flux, and composition of the jets from 3I/Atlas. These findings will help determine whether the object is of natural or technological origin.</p>
